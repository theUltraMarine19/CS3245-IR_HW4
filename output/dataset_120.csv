2762975,R v Bugmy [2013] NSWSC 1885,"Remarks on sentence

1BARR AJ The offender, Randall Scott Bugmy, was charged with the murder of Roy Johnson at Broken Hill on 25 February 2012. On 9 December 2013, the day fixed for the commencement of his trial, he offered a plea of guilty of the manslaughter of Mr. Johnson and the Crown accepted the offer in discharge of the indictment.

The Facts

2At about 10:00am on Saturday 25 February 2012 the offender, then aged 25 years, and his mother, Patsy Ann Bugmy, attended premises at 115 Creedon Street, Broken Hill, not far from where they lived. They were members of a group of people who appeared to the occupant, Ms Tina Crowe, to have been drinking. With them were the deceased, aged 24 years, and Marie Johnson, his mother. The group remained at Ms Crowe's house and continued to drink beer and wine throughout the day. 

3At about 7:30pm an altercation took place between Ms Anevea Dutton and Ms Johnson. The deceased took Ms Dutton into the house so that she could calm down. A little later a fight took place between Ms Bugmy and Ms Johnson. The deceased left the house, entered the yard and began assaulting the offender. They exchanged punches. The deceased gained the upper hand and forced the offender back against the front fence. The offender went down on the grass and the deceased stood over him, punching him. The offender punched back. 

4Ms Dutton left the house and tried to break up the fight between the two women. The deceased left off his attack on the offender and punched Ms Dutton in the eye, causing a laceration. She was treated later that evening at hospital. 

5The deceased resumed his attack on the offender, who was still on the ground. He managed to get to his feet and seized a pair of scissors which was lying near him on the ground. He delivered three blows with the scissors causing penetrating injuries to the face, the shoulder and the neck of the deceased. The injuries to the right cheek and throat were the substantial cause of the eventual death of the deceased. After the altercation the offender picked up a piece of broken bottle. The deceased walked away and the offender did not use it.

6Three teenage children, who were nearby and no doubt attracted by the commotion, saw what happened.

7The deceased and his mother left the house and walked to their house not far away. A few minutes later the deceased left the house and asked a neighbour for a lift to the hospital because, he said, he had been in a fight and was injured. He was advised to wait for an ambulance but walked off. He went into an adjoining street and there spoke to other people. They offered the same advice and he walked off again. He went to another house and spoke to the occupants, whom he knew. He fell to the floor and complained that he was having trouble breathing. One of the occupants helped him to stand up and walk to a car and drove him to the Broken Hill Base Hospital. During the short drive the deceased said ""Randall Bugmy done this to me"". The neighbour saw that he was having trouble breathing, gasping for air.

8During all this time a number of emergency calls were made, the first at 8:00pm and the last shortly before an ambulance responded at 8:32pm.

9The deceased entered the accident and emergency section of the hospital at 8:35pm. Staff gave him directions but he would not co-operate and wandered around the emergency department. A medical practitioner tried to assess him but he would not co-operate. He was given a sedative in an effort to bring him under control. He was bleeding from the mouth and the nose and the injuries to his face, neck and shoulder were apparent. The medical practitioner described him as acting in an intoxicated manner and smelling strongly of alcohol. However, he was conscious, conversant and oriented. There was a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, with no apparent airway compromise. He was impossible to examine and kept walking about. He was aggressive and combative. Staff and attending police were called to restrain him. At 8:55pm he was given a further dose of sedative. Hospital staff noticed an injury inside the deceased's throat. It was decided to try to intubate his airway at about 9:00pm but the attempt failed. 10 minutes later an attempt to administer a further dose of sedative was only partly successful because the deceased removed the intravenous cannula. Before intubation could be achieved the deceased went into respiratory and then cardiac arrest. That was at 9:15pm. He lost consciousness. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was performed. By then the swelling in his throat was so severe that he could not be intubated. An emergency tracheotomy was performed and he was oxygenated. His heartbeat was restored with the assistance of two injections of adrenalin and his blood pressure was restored within 9 minutes of his arrest. He was stabilised and taken into surgery, where his pharyngeal injury was repaired and his other injuries sutured . However, he did not regain consciousness. 

10On the 5th of March 2012 the deceased was transferred to Royal Adelaide Hospital. He was recorded as having a retropharyngeal haemorrhage, lacerations and suspected fracture of the C2/C3 vertebrae. Hypoxic brain damage was indicated. Although he was able to support his own breathing via the brain stem, his brain damage was irreparable and he was returned to Broken Hill Base Hospital on the 23rd of March 2012 to be closer to his family. He died on 30 April 2012.

11Dr. Beer examined the deceased post mortem. His opinion was that a chain of events arose from the injuries to the face and the throat. There were bleeding, swelling and occlusion of the airway which gave rise to a cardiopulmonary arrest. In the opinion of Dr. Beer the damage to the C2/C3 vertebrae implied that significant force was required to cause the penetrating injury to the throat. The fracture itself, however, was probably not a significant factor. Dr. Beer was of the opinion that the delay to intubation resulting from the swollen pharyngeal injury gave rise to a prolonged period of hypoxia. Although blood pressure was restored, the deceased had by then sustained severe hypoxic brain damage. The neuropathology finding was of diffuse hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.

12Dr. Beer was also of the opinion that the lack of co-operation and the deceased's aggressive behaviour would have been significant factors in preventing the appropriate assessment of his injuries, the control of the bleeding and the institution of a stable patent airway. He was of the opinion that if the deceased had been co-operative it was highly probable that there would have been successful intubation before hypoxic changes occurred.

13As a result of the disturbances at Ms Crowe's house the police were called and attended. They were informed that the deceased had been taken to hospital, so they went there to assist hospital staff try to manage him. As a result of what they were told by eyewitnesses they returned to Ms Crowe's house and arrested the offender for assault. He was cautioned. He denied assault. At the police station he was told that the deceased had been stabbed in the cheek. He received legal advice. He was further cautioned and declined to say anything. However, he told one officer that ""it was self defence"". The custody manager required him to blow into an alcohol breath test machine and noted a reading of 0.244 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. He had a swollen, bruised left eye. He gave a buccal sample for DNA testing.

14On 26 February 2012 the offender was taken to Broken Hill Correctional Centre where he went through normal intake and screening procedures. His injuries were noted and he said that he had been assaulted the day before. He said that he had received the eye injury during a fight with the deceased. He said that he had been drinking lots of Moselle and had shared two cartons. He had also been smoking marijuana, in the order of 20 cones. An officer asked the offender if he had used a weapon and he said, ""Scissors, Miss"". He expressed his concern that the deceased might die and that he would be charged with murder. He also expressed concern for the welfare of the deceased. 

15The police searched the yard of the house where the assault took place and recovered a pair of scissor blades and a broken piece of scissor handle. The total length of the scissors was 12.8 centimetres. The blade portion of the scissors measured 7.8 centimetres.

16The evidence shows that the deceased took the scissors to the party to cut up marijuana to make cigarettes for those present. He did not use them in the fight.

17Blood on the scissors yielded DNA which matched the deceased's DNA.

18The plea of guilty of manslaughter was offered and accepted on the basis of excessive self-defence.

The Offender and his Family

19The offender gave evidence and spoke about his childhood, his family and his introduction to petrol sniffing, alcohol and marijuana. He said something about the offences he had committed. Mr Wilson SC, for the offender, tendered reports and other evidence describing in detail the history of the family, particularly respecting its involvement with the Department of Community Services.

20The offender was born on 25 June 1986 and is now 27 years old. Despite a deprived childhood, about which I shall say more, he was dealt with only twice in the Children's Court, first in 1998 when he was 11 years old and in 2003 when he was 17 years old. He has never been committed to an institution. There are convictions for offences of violence. There were two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2007 and one each in 2008, 2009 and 2010, for all of which he received custodial sentences. He was also convicted of assault in 2004, assaulting and resisting police in 2005, 2006 and twice in 2007 and for escaping from police custody in 2006. He has damaged property and has contravened personal violence orders. His longest sentence, and the only one in respect of which he has been convicted on indictment, was imposed in the District Court in March 2009 for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and indecent assault. He was sentenced to a term incorporating a non-parole period of 9 months. Altogether he has been sentenced to imprisonment on ten occasions between 2005 and 2010. His longest non-parole period has been 9 months.

21Several of the Department of Community Services documents tendered deal with the offender's elder brother, Donald Douglas Bugmy. He was a little over a year older than the offender and they were close. Robert Young was their father. In August 2004 Mr Young made an affidavit for use in proceedings concerning Donald Bugmy. He said that the mother of Donald and the offender was drinking a lot during her pregnancy with Donald, about 4 to 5 days a week as far as he remembered. He said that Donald used to follow his brothers around after school. They started sniffing petrol when they were about 10 years old. Mr Young did not mention the offender in that respect, but I accept his evidence that he, in turn, followed his elder brother Donald around and learned to sniff petrol from him and his elder brothers.

22In submissions Mr Wilson drew a number of matters from the several reports and from the evidence of the offender. The offender is the fourth of five boys born to his mother. His father died in 2008. His mother has been alcoholic from a young age. She drank throughout her pregnancies. It was reported of Donald that he may have suffered foetal alcohol syndrome. There is a psychologist's report in evidence in that respect. It is possible also that the offender is so affected, but it cannot be put higher than that.

23The relationship between the parents was marred by domestic violence and drinking. They separated in 1997/1998 when the offender was 11 or 12 years old.

24The departmental records demonstrate an appalling background history for the children of this family. Notifications to the Department were occurring when the offender was as young as 3 years old. There is a well-established history of a lack of food and care, reported to and noted in the Department's records during the 1980s and the 1990s. It is recorded that when there was no food in the house the children went out at night and stole food.

25The offender was led into petrol-sniffing by his brothers. He was admitted to hospital suffering from the effects of that practice on a number of occasions. He was admitted to the Broken Hill hospital in 1995 with suspected pancreatitis as a result of alcohol consumption. He was then 9 years old. The three brothers, Donald, the offender and Hayden, the youngest, were admitted to hospital together as a result of petrol-sniffing in October 1996. The offender was admitted again in March 1997 when he was 10 years old.

26Care proceedings were taken concerning Donald, the offender and Hayden in the Broken Hill Children's Court in 1997. Court reports noted school absences, disruptive behaviour and continued petrol-sniffing. Reports were made by the Department of Housing of continued domestic violence, noise, abusive language and damage to property.

27The offender and Hayden were placed in the care of their aunt, Ms Joyce Bugmy, and went to live with her in Dubbo. They went to school there and their father visited them there.

28The offender continued with some petrol-sniffing and offending behaviour and left school in year 9. He returned to live with his mother in about 2002.

29The most serious part of the offender's record of offending began in 2003. He still has problems with alcohol abuse and he smokes cannabis.

30Three of his brothers are in custody. Donald is serving a sentence at Cessnock. Damien, the eldest, is serving a sentence for manslaughter at Goulburn. Hayden is serving the balance of parole for failing to report. He is kept at the Broken Hill Correctional Centre.

31The offender has had a number of homes. He lived in Wilcannia from his early life, first with his parents and then with his grandmother or aunts. The authorities moved him to Broken Hill at age 9 or 10 because of concern over his petrol-sniffing. When he was 11 years old the Children's Court sent him to live in Dubbo with his aunt, Joyce Bugmy. He left school early in year nine when he was 15 years old, he said because he had begun stealing. He returned to Broken Hill. His father, who had kept in touch with him over the years, visited him frequently. His mother visited him less frequently. While he was in Broken Hill he stopped sniffing petrol but began smoking marijuana. He had been drinking alcohol since he was aged 9 or 10.

32His father was, I think, a good influence on his life. Whenever he was living away from his father's house his father would visit him. He was most anxious and did what he could to stop the offender sniffing petrol. Sadly, he was unable to do so. The offender's mother seems to have been less of an influence on him and has herself been a heavy consumer of alcohol. In more recent times at least she has been in poor health. There have been other good influences on his life, notably Joyce Bugmy in Dubbo. The most stable period of his life seems to have been the five or so years he lived in her household. 

33After leaving school at 15 years of age he did not work until he was 18. He smoked marijuana and drank alcohol. Then his father found him a job in the Community Development Employment Program, an organisation of which his father was a supervisor. There was competition for the work offered and applicants had to take turns. The offender had a number of turns, the longest of which lasted a month. That work stopped when his father died in 2008. After that he was offered no work and appears not to have sought work.

34At the conclusion of his first longish custodial sentence the offender was released under supervision for alcohol use and anger management. He attended counselling. However, he kept on drinking. He looked for a job but did not find one.

35His latest and longest prison term resulted from his attack with a cricket bat on his aunt. He attended a drug and alcohol course in custody. On his release he was again made subject to supervision, but he drank whenever he could get money.

36For about 12 months before the commission of the present offence the offender was living in the community and staying out of trouble.

The Objective Gravity of the Offence

37Our society regards very seriously criminal activity which results in the death of one of its members. The parliament has emphasised that regard by fixing the maximum sentence for manslaughter as imprisonment for 25 years. The community expects that human life will be protected by the law and that those who take it will be punished. 

38It seems to me that these factors are those by which the present offence is to be determined. The offence arose during a day of drinking by a group of Aboriginal persons, many of whom were related to each other. The deceased and the offender were second cousins and had got on well together in the past. The offender and others were smoking marijuana. The mothers of the deceased and the offender were present and had been drinking.

39A pair of scissors was being used to cut up the marijuana during the day. The mothers of the deceased and the offender became involved in a fight. The deceased, a larger man than the offender, who is a small man, commenced an assault on the offender. He responded with punches but was forced backwards and onto the ground.

40The deceased fought only with fists.

41The offender saw the deceased's scissors on the ground and, in order to protect himself, rose and struck the deceased three blows. The blow to the shoulder was superficial and ultimately unimportant. The other two blows were more important because they caused extensive and troublesome bleeding. The one that struck the spine and fractured it was delivered with considerable force.

42The three blows were inflicted in a very short space of time.

43The offender stabbed the deceased because he thought it was necessary to do so to protect himself. But for the attack launched upon him he would not have done what he did.

44Treatment in good time would have resulted in successful intubation. The vertebral fracture, though serious, was not life-threatening. The delay in treatment which led to hypoxia was the result of the deceased's unreasonable conduct. But for it, the deceased would probably not have died.

45The offender acted out of anger while he was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana.

46One of the features by which the objective gravity of the offence may be judged is the intent with which the offender delivered the blows that caused death. Mr Wilson submitted that the Court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intent was to do really serious bodily injury. I do not accept that submission. These features satisfy me that he had that intent, namely the fact that three blows were struck, the fact that the one that struck the spine was dealt with considerable force, enough to fracture the spine, and that at the conclusion of the fight the offender armed himself with a broken bottle and was, as I find, prepared to use it.

Aggravating Features

47It is an aggravating feature that the offence was committed in the presence of children. The weight to be given to that feature is, however, to be moderated by the fact that the children were of older than tender years, two of them being 13 years of age and the third somewhat older, and by the fact that they were not there when the violence began. Rather, they were attracted by what was going on and came to look.

48It is correct to say that the offence took place in Ms Crowe's home, though that feature is to be given little weight because the events took place close to the outer boundary of her land and not in the house. Ms Crowe herself left the premises before these events unfolded.

49It is normally said to be a seriously aggravating feature that an assault is perpetrated by the use of a knife. Scissors are like a knife in the sense that they are capable of stabbing and killing. However, I accept the submission of Mr Wilson, for the offender, that to regard the use of the scissors as aggravating the criminality would be to ignore the fact that but for their use the force used would not have been excessive. In any case, the offender did not own the scissors or take them to the fight. As he was under attack he saw them on the ground and seized them opportunistically. That act and the resulting blows must have occupied only a few seconds. I do not think that this feature aggravates.

Mitigating Features

50The deceased's unreasonable refusal of treatment and its effect mitigate the offender's criminality.

51So does the fact that the offender's act took place on the spur of the moment and without planning.

52So does his plea of guilty. The offence took place almost two years ago and a good deal of preparation had to go into making the case ready for hearing. The plea of guilty emerged on the morning of the day set for the commencement of the trial. For the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty the offender is entitled to a discount from his sentence at the bottom of the proper range.

53I accept that the offender is remorseful. That is established by his enquiries about the welfare of the deceased on his admission to the Broken Hill Correctional Centre, by his plea of guilty and by his expression before me in evidence that he was sorry. I accept that he is genuinely remorseful. 

Prospects of Rehabilitation

54Relevantly, the strongest influences on the offender's life in recent years have been his lack of work, his limited experience of work and his apparent inability to obtain work, coupled with the inescapable fact that when he has nothing to do he spends all his money on alcohol and marijuana. As he acknowledges, if he does not get work after his release he will probably drink. He knows that if he does drink he will do so to excess and will be unable to manage his anger. All his offences of violence have arisen in just such a way. He believes that he has a chance of changing things and wants to take the chance to do so if only he can obtain work. Unfortunately, he appears incapable of finding it. He badly needs to make and to have made on his behalf an attack on these problems. He needs training, advice and counselling on staying away from alcohol. He needs to be better able to control his anger and he needs professional assistance to help him to do so. He needs to be offered work and to be able to find work for himself.

55I do not know whether he can escape from the grip of alcohol and other drugs upon him. His own history and the fact that many members of his wider family and of the community in which he moves have the selfsame problems make his prospects look doubtful. Even so, he must be given every chance. It is in society's interest that that happen.

56The offender is entitled to particular consideration because of the life of deprivation he has suffered. I have set out earlier in these remarks only some of the features of his life. I take into account his neglect and deprivation and his early introduction to petrol-sniffing, encouraged by his brothers, and to the use of alcohol, which was, I think, ordinarily abused in his parents' house. I take into account his resulting inability to cope with the ordinary problems of life.

57It is to be expected that the offender will be offered help during the custodial portion of his sentence, but the need to continue and extend that help upon his release of itself requires a greater proportion of his sentence to be available for parole then would ordinary be appropriate.

Victim Impact Statements

58Victim Impact Statements were received from Alinta Edge, the deceased's partner and mother of his three young children, Maria Johnson, his mother, Grace Margaret Kennedy, his grandmother, Lorina Johnson, his sister and Morna Johnson, his aunt. These statements show how much the deceased's family loved him and how terrible his loss has been for them, how badly they have been affected and how much they miss him. The Court cannot take these matters into account in fixing the sentence to be imposed on the offender, but it can and does extend its sympathy to the deceased's family and to all those who have been affected by his death, and express the hope that now that this proceedings is over they may have comfort.

Sentence

59Randall Scott Bugmy, I sentence you to imprisonment for the manslaughter of Roy Johnson. I set a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, which will be taken to have commenced on 25 February 2012 and which will expire on 24 August 2015. The balance of the term of imprisonment will be 3 years and 6 months. It will expire on 24 February 2019. The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 24 August 2015.

5The starting point for the overall sentence was 11 years and 4 months imprisonment from which his Honour took off 25 percent for the pleas of guilty, thus resulting in the net sentence set out above.
6The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal:
Ground of Appeal - that in all the circumstances the sentence was manifestly excessive.
Factual Background
7In January and February 2012 Blacktown Detectives investigated the supply of crystal methylamphetamine in the Doonside area.  As part of the investigation, a warrant for the interception of a certain telephone number used by a Melchor Loteria was obtained.   A large number of telephone calls and messages between Loteria and the applicant on a particular telephone number were recorded relating to the supply of methylamphetamine via the applicant to Loteria.  Loteria on-sold the majority of the methylamphetamine obtained to other purchasers.
8Between 17 January 2012 and 7 February 2012 on 39 occasions the applicant sold a total of 127 grams of methylamphetamine to Loteria.  Those are the agreed facts in respect of the offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug.
9On 8 February 2012 the applicant was driving a certain vehicle in Canley Heights when police stopped it and arrested him.  He had 5 satchels of crystal methylamphetamine in his front shirt pocket containing a total of 12 grams.  The applicant had 1 mobile telephone in his left pants pocket and a further 9 mobile telephones, 1 Westpac Handycard in his name; 5 Commonwealth Bank Keycards in his name, 1 Visa Debit Card in the name of Tuan Nguyen and an extendable baton in the vehicle.  A black wallet containing $3,200 in Australian currency and $301 in US currency was also located in the vehicle.
10The applicant was transported to the Cabramatta Police Station, where he participated in an electronically recorded interview and made full admissions to supplying the prohibited drug crystal methylamphetamine (ice) to Loteria, usually on a daily basis.  He said that he purchased the drugs for $7,500 per 28 grams (1 ounce) and would sell it for $12,000 for 3.5 grams, making a profit of $2,100 per 28 grams of the drug.
11After completion of the interview, the applicant was taken to his home at Canley Heights where a search warrant was executed.  The applicant took investigators to a locked room where he identified an esky containing resealable bags of crystal methylamphetamine, a cupboard containing resealable bags of crystal methylamphetamine, an extendable baton and an unloaded .22 long calibre rifle Jennings J-22, a self-loading pistol and 6 rounds of ammunition for this firearm, a .32 automatic calibre double-barrelled key-ring style firearm and 2 rounds of ammunition for this firearm, 3 digital scales and 4 black balaclavas.  The contents of the 141 resealable bags were analysed and found to contain a total of 749.6 grams of methylamphetamine.  
Proceedings in the District Court
12The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was born in February 1980.  He had a record of some minor criminal offences comprising damaging property by a firearm, common assault, stalking and intimidating with intent to cause personal injury and destruction of property.  His Honour assessed that record as ""relatively insignificant"" and treated it as a mitigating factor.
13His Honour had before him a pre-sentence report, dated 13 December 2012.  That recorded the applicant as saying that he committed the offences due to his parents' gambling debts.  His Honour did not accept that explanation and concluded that since the applicant was not himself a drug addict, the offending was partly for the purpose of meeting his parents' gambling debts and partly to gain personal profit.
14The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, but his brother did.  His evidence was that the applicant was born in Vietnam and came to Australia from a refugee camp in Malaysia.  He was bullied by other students in Australia when he went to school, owing to his lack of English.  The applicant had been gainfully employed since leaving school in a gardening business.  The applicant did not report any financial stresses of his own to the writer of the pre-sentence report.
15When asked to explain his offending, the applicant said that his sole focus was to keep his family safe and repay their debts.  He said that he had the firearms in order to protect himself as he was out of his depth.  The applicant's brother gave evidence that the purpose of the possession of the firearms was to protect the applicant against his ex-wife who was asking for money.  His Honour did not accept that explanation and concluded that the applicant kept the weapons in order to protect himself when dealing with large amounts of drugs.  He did, however, accept that the applicant was ""out of his depth"".
16His Honour had before him an analysis certificate which described the methylamphetamine involved in the supply of a commercial quantity charge as having a purity of 79 percent.  His Honour accepted that this went to the criminality of the offence of supply of a commercial quantity. Statistics in relation to various offences were placed before his Honour and he endeavoured to take those into account when formulating the sentences which he imposed.  His Honour accepted that the statistics gave some idea of the general range of sentencing for offences of the type before him.  
17His Honour had before him a psychological report from Mr Mark Howard.  In that report, the applicant described himself as being relieved when he was caught.  His Honour said:
""That is to his credit because I think the true situation is that he was, as he told the writer of the pre-sentence report, ""out of his depth"", and realised that he was in the hands of serious criminals and wished to escape, and that the only way of doing so was to be arrested and sentenced for the current matters.  That is to his credit.""  (ROS 10.7)
18Counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings conceded that there was a need for some accumulation of sentences.  He suggested that the offences were mid-range.  His Honour agreed with that assessment, except in relation to the supply of a prohibited drug in not less than a commercial quantity offence.   His Honour regarded that offence as above mid-range.
19His Honour noted the following matters which were put to him to mitigate the applicant's offending.  The applicant had made full and frank admissions when arrested.  At no time during the ongoing supply offences had the applicant been armed with any of the firearms which were found at his house.  There was no suggestion that he was armed at other times when drug dealing.  It was put as a significant matter that when arrested, the applicant had no weapons in his possession.  Accordingly, his Honour accepted that the applicant did not carry a gun or guns when drug dealing.
20The Crown conceded that remorse was an available finding, despite the fact that the applicant did not give evidence.  The Crown accepted that such an inference could be drawn because of the applicant's full disclosure of his offending in his record of interview and because of his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  His Honour accepted that the applicant had displayed some degree of remorse and had taken a degree of responsibility for his offending.
21In relation to the objective seriousness of the offences, his Honour noted that the offence of supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug was substantially above the threshold of 250 grams.  His Honour noted that although the amount of a drug involved in an offence was not the only aspect to be taken into account when assessing criminality, it still remained a significant factor.  The presence of the methylamphetamine in a large number of bags reinforced his Honour's conclusion that the applicant was involved in a significant selling enterprise.  His Honour found that offence to be above mid-range, although not much above it.  On that issue, his Honour noted that the maximum penalty and non-parole period were guideposts in the sentencing process. 
22His Honour said that he did not apply the standard non-parole periods to any of the offences because of the pleas of guilty and because of the favourable subjective factors in the applicant's case.  Although there were 39 supplies in the ongoing supply charge, his Honour was not prepared to find that the objective seriousness of that offence was above mid-range.  In that regard, his Honour took into account that the quantity involved in each supply was small.
Submissions
23The applicant accepted that there was no clear error of principle in the sentencing judge's reasons.  Nevertheless, he submitted that the size of the sentence was such as to indicate underlying error.  By reference to House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 the applicant submitted that upon the facts the total sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust so that this Court should infer that in some way there had been a failure to properly exercise the sentencing discretion and the sentence should be reduced.
24The applicant submitted that there was a material error in the sentencing process, having regard to the sentencing judge's factual findings and the sentence ultimately imposed, even though that error could not be identified with precision.  In those circumstances, the applicant submitted that leave should still be granted and the appeal upheld on the basis that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed.
25The applicant sought to identify error by reference to his Honour's observation that the quantity of methylamphetamine in the commercial quantity offence was approaching the threshold for the more serious offence of supplying a large commercial quantity.  The applicant submitted that this was a misleading and irrelevant consideration.
26The applicant submitted that although his Honour identified as his starting point a total sentence of 11 years and 4 months, the real starting point must have been much higher otherwise his Honour could not have taken into account the applicant's strong subjective case.  The applicant suggested a starting point of 14 years or more which he submitted was excessive for these offences.
27The applicant submitted that his Honour's finding of mid-range objective seriousness for most of the offences and slightly above mid-range for the supply of a commercial quantity offence, resulted in mid-range sentences.  This of itself, the applicant submitted, was indicative of error.  As a result this Court should infer that the sentences and non-parole periods imposed were affected by error and were manifestly excessive.  In the alternative, even if individually the sentences were appropriate, the accumulation and the ultimate effective sentence were manifestly excessive.
Consideration
28The applicant had difficulty in articulating the error relied upon.  This is not surprising.  As was said by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]:
""61 Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive.  It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short.   But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion.  A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.""
29To the extent that the applicant did articulate error, he did not challenge the individual sentences but rather the extent of the accumulation and the total effective sentence ultimately imposed.
30The matters for which the applicant was being sentenced were very serious offences.  The items found in the applicant's home, taken with the facts surrounding the ongoing supply offence, made it clear that the applicant had a well established business of supplying the extremely dangerous and destructive drug, ice.
31In relation to the offence of supplying a commercial quantity, his Honour did not err by noting that the quantity of drug was three-quarters of the threshold required for the more serious offence of supplying a large commercial quantity.  In making that observation his Honour was doing no more than highlighting the fact that the amount of drug involved was substantial and well above the threshold for the offence of supplying a commercial quantity.  The amount of drug involved, while not being solely determinative of seriousness, is a significant factor when assessing criminality in drug supply.
32The firearm offences also involved a significant level of criminality.  In Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 Johnson J (with whom Bathurst CJ and James J agreed) at [64] - [73] referred to the policy reasons behind s7(1) Firearms Act 1989 and matters relevant to the seriousness of the offence.  His Honour said that the use or purpose of possession of an unlicensed firearm - particularly where it is connected with criminal activities - was regarded as a key factor in assessing the seriousness of offences contrary to the Act.
33In R v Dusan Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 Latham J (with whom Sully and RS Hulme JJ agreed) said at [14]:
""14 ... In any event, accepting the applicant's argument for present purposes, possession of a loaded gun for one's own protection is not a matter of significant, if any mitigation, since the policy of the legislature evinced by the enactment of the offence and a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is to deter and punish possession of firearms per se. ...""
34Part of the rationale behind s7(1) was explained by RS Hulme J (with whom in Beazley JA and Latham J agreed) in R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [40]:
""40 ... That rationale includes at least a recognition that firearms and pistols, if possessed, are liable to be used, and if used, are liable to be a source of great danger or damage.  It includes also a recognition that not all persons can be relied on to avoid or minimise such danger and not misuse the weapons and that misuse, even without discharge, is liable to amount to a great infringement of others' rights.""
35This Court has said on a number of occasions that an offender's criminality is more serious where he or she possesses a firearm as part of their involvement in crimes, such as trading in illegal drugs.  In R v Amurao [2005] NSWCCA 32 at [69] RS Hulme J said:
""69 ... It behoves the Courts to discourage any tendency for such objects to become just tools of trade for those whose activities are outside the law.""
This is particularly so in relation to the possession of a concealed weapon such as the key-ring pistol which was not capable of lawful use.
36Once the objective seriousness of the offences and moral culpability associated with their commission is appreciated, some measure of accumulation between them was required.  This was conceded by counsel appearing in the sentence proceedings.  The extent of the accumulation was a discretionary matter for assessment by the primary judge.  In this case the extent of the accumulation was modest, given that the offences were discrete and serious.  Applying the test of manifest excess approved in Dinsdale, i.e., whether a sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" it is clear that the sentences imposed in this case did not satisfy this test.
37The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
38SIMPSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
39HALL J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2762998,R v Lake [2013] NSWDC 315,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Section 11 remands are important tools in the sentencing process. They enable a judge to obtain more information about an offender and his or her prospects of rehabilitation before determining the most appropriate sentence. They enable an offender to demonstrate rehabilitation rather than just promise it. 

2A matter in this category came before me some time ago. Dean Lake had pleaded guilty to two offences and asked me to take into account other offences. In August 2011 evidence that I received suggested that Mr Lake was making substantial efforts at rehabilitating himself. He clearly has a long term problem with alcohol, and whilst drunk, regularly enough commits offences, including offences of some seriousness. But in August 2011 there were concrete indications that Mr Lake was capable of overcoming his problems with alcohol which in turn would mean that he was going to overcome his problems with the criminal law.

3He came back before me in March 2012. The evidence that I received on that occasion I summarised in these terms. ""He comes before me today having done all that was required of him."" The material suggested that Mr Lake had rehabilitated himself to a significant extent. There was a favourable pre-sentence report tendered, and other evidence suggested the substantial benefit that Mr Lake had achieved through me releasing him on a s 11 bond. 

4What I did not know then, but now know, is that on the very morning he appeared before me in March 2012 he had committed two criminal offences, an offence of aggravated stealing in a dwelling and breaking out, and taken into account on that offence was an offence of obtaining financial advantage by deception. Thus, not to put too fine a point on it, I was completely misled when I sentence Mr Lake in March 2012. 

5Because of the glowing evidence that I had received concerning his rehabilitation I put him on a s 9 bond. Had I known the truth of course, that is something that would have been completely inappropriate. Since going onto the s 9 bond he has been sentenced for the offences he committed on the day he appeared before me, and been sentenced for a number of other offences committed in February this year. He admits that the offences in February this year are breaches of the s 9 bond, and thus it falls to me to sentence him. 

6When Mr Lake is not drinking he is crime free. As Mr Jeffery, who appeared for him today submitted, what Mr Lake's history demonstrates is the power that alcohol has over him. He needs substantial support in overcoming his problems with alcohol. But he also needs to be reminded in a very concrete way about what is going to happen to him should he continue to commit further offences. Personal deterrence is of significant importance in these sentencing proceedings.

7Mr Lake has undergone residential rehabilitation in the past, including in the lead up to the offences in February this year. He has demonstrated that he is capable of being alcohol free for significant periods of time. But he has also demonstrated a tendency to relapse and then commit further offences. 

8He gave evidence today, and he recognises how he has suffered through his problems with alcohol. It is the root cause of his present custodial situation and he understands that if he is to avoid spending longer and longer periods in gaol he simply has to never drink again. Of course that is an easy thing to say. But Mr Lake's history demonstrates the difficulty that he will have upon his release from custody.

9The purposes of sentencing are multi-faceted. In this case I will impose a sentence which takes account of the need to rehabilitate Mr Lake, but which also takes account of the need to punish him for the offences he committed now some time ago. As I said earlier, personal deterrence is important in Mr Lake's case. When he is released from custody and he is tempted to drink, he must do so knowing that if he does there is a very good chance that he will commit further offences. And if he does that there is a hundred per cent chance that he will go back to gaol.

10The principle of totality applies of course to the sentence that I am about to impose. I have to take account of the various sentences that Mr Lake has been serving of recent times: Judge Syme's sentence for the offences he committed on the day he appeared before me; the magistrate's sentence for the offences which led to the breach of the s 9 bond; and now these sentences for the offences with which I am dealing. 

11Special circumstances clearly apply, not only because of the accumulation which is necessarily required, but also because of the need to closely supervise Mr Lake upon his release from custody.

12Mr Jeffery submitted that I should impose a sentence upon Mr Lake which sees him serving no extra time in custody beyond that which has already the subject of previous sentences. That is clearly not a possible outcome. As it turns out Mr Lake had not rehabilitated himself when I thought he had. Had the truth been known in March 2012 I would have sent Mr Lake to gaol there and then. He cannot go unpunished for those offences and so he must spend a period of further time in custody. It is less than would ordinarily be the case because of the need to ensure that Mr Lake is given as much opportunity as possible upon his release from custody.

13For the offence of break and enter with intent to steal in circumstances of aggravation the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 27 February 2014, with a head sentence of three and a half years.

14For the offence of larceny I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months to date from 27 February 2014. This means that Mr Lake is eligible to be released to parole on 27 August 2015.

15I should indicate that in imposing sentence for the first matter I have taken into account the matters on the Form 1.

		16 April 2014",2013-12-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763001,R v Taupe [2013] NSWDC 328,"JUDGMENT


1Abbie White went to the police in 2010. She claimed that her stepfather had sexually assaulted her regularly when she was a girl. It started in 1996 when she was 8 and finished in 2004 just before she turned 16. 

2The police made contact with Peter Taupe who had been Abbie White's stepfather. He was interviewed by them and agreed that he had sexually assaulted her. The police charged Peter Taupe with the sexual assaults which Abbie White had told them about. The matter was referred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and a Crown Prosecutor settled an indictment representing 16 of the assaults Abbie White had told the police about. 

3The prosecution and the defence agreed on a trial without a jury and the indictment was presented before me on 27 November 2012. 

4Despite his admissions to the police, Peter Taupe pleaded not guilty to each of the charges in the indictment. His admissions did not specify any dates and they were clear to some extent about what he did and did not do during the sexual assaults. He was also fairly clear about how old Abbie White was when he started assaulting her. 

5On the other hand, Abbie White claimed the assaults started much earlier and were more serious. In addition she was unable to specify particular dates when she was assaulted. The best she could do was to say they happened close to certain events or over certain periods of time. Each of the charges in the indictment therefore refers to a particular month or series of months. 

6So the issues in this case were focused around whether Abbie White could be sure that anything at all happened during the particular period claimed in each charge and whether the assaults were as serious as she claimed they were. 

7It becomes obvious why the parties chose to conduct this case before a judge without a jury. The prejudice to an accused conducting such a defence before a jury would have been overwhelming. 

8This case will illustrate how frustrating the processes of the criminal law must be for genuine victims of sexual assault. But it will also illustrate how important a role the criminal law plays in protecting the rights of persons charged with serious crimes, even persons who have defiled the innocent. Everyone is entitled to the protection of their rights afforded by the criminal law, not just the completely innocent.

9There are certain legal issues which it is convenient to refer to at the outset because the submissions in the case were based upon those legal issues and they are also relevant to my findings. 

10Obviously Mr Taupe, like any person in the community, is presumed innocent. The responsibility or onus is on the prosecution to prove him guilty. Before I can find him guilty of any of the offences contained in the indictment, I must be satisfied of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 

11Abbie White was the principal witness called by the prosecution. There were no other eye witnesses to the events which she specifically claimed had occurred. Because the prosecution case is based exclusively on my accepting Abbie White, I must exercise caution before I find the Peter Taupe guilty. I have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Abbie White is both an honest and accurate witness in the account she has given before I can find Mr Taupe guilty. I must examine the evidence of Abbie White very carefully in order to satisfy myself that I can safely act upon that evidence to the standard required. 

12The prosecution called evidence not only of the events which made their way into the indictment in the form of charges, but of other sexual assaults surrounding those events. That other evidence was admitted for the purpose of placing Abbie White's evidence of the particular acts which the prosecution relied upon into a realistic context. It avoids artificiality or unreality in the presentation of her evidence of the particular assaults on the indictment. I must be careful not to use the evidence of the other acts as establishing any tendency on the part of Mr Taupe to commit the offences which are charged or of that type. I must not of course substitute the evidence of the other acts for the evidence of the specific offences which the prosecution must rely upon to prove its case. Nor must I, of course, reason that because Mr Taupe may have done something wrong on another occasion, he must have done so on the occasions claimed in the indictment. 

13I have referred just now to tendency evidence. The prosecution relied upon the admissions made by Mr Taupe in his interview with the police as what the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) calls tendency evidence. Before I could use the evidence in the way which the prosecution invites me to, I must make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. First, I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts claimed by the prosecution to amount to tendency in fact occurred. If I am so satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, then I must ask myself whether from the acts which I have found proved, I can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Taupe had the tendency that the prosecution claims. If I am so satisfied of both those matters then I may use the tendency relied upon by the prosecution in considering whether or not Peter Taupe committed the offences which are charged in the indictment. 

14Although I referred to 16 events which made their way into the indictment, the indictment in fact contains 20 counts. That is because there are a number of alternatives to primary counts. I must of course be careful that I do not regard the availability of any alternative count as an invitation to compromise any verdict which I may be otherwise considering. 

15Mr Taupe himself did not give evidence in the proceedings. He of course, I repeat, bears no onus of proof. He is innocent until I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence led by the prosecution that he is guilty of one or more of the offences charged. He is therefore entitled to say nothing and to make the prosecution prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It follows that Mr Taupe's exercise of his right not to give evidence cannot be used against him in any way. It cannot amount to an admission of guilt. I cannot use it as a basis for any other inference unfavourable to him. I cannot use it to fill any gaps that I might think exist in the prosecution case. It cannot strengthen the prosecution case or in anyway assist the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

16Because there are so many charges in the indictment I must consider this question: if I found that Abbie White's evidence on one or more counts was in some way unreliable, what impact does such a finding have when I am considering other counts? The answer to that question has been provided by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case named R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 125 A Crim R 186 over [259] to [263]. If I entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the untruthfulness or unreliability of Abbie White's evidence in relation to one or more counts, I must take that finding into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of her evidence generally. 

17The claimed sexual abuse extended over some period of time. It was claimed to have commenced in 1996 and it was not until 2010 that Abbie White approached the police. I must heed the warning provided for by s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that the absence of complaint, or delay in complaining, does not necessarily indicate that the allegation that the offence was committed is false. I must bear in mind that there may be good reasons why the victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making or refraining from making a complaint about a sexual assault. 

18Both parties in this case were represented by very competent junior counsel. Mr CC Patrick was briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions as the Crown Prosecutor. Ms B O'Reilly was retained on behalf of Mr Taupe as his defence counsel. Both counsel have been of enormous assistance to me in their competent conduct of the trial and in their written and oral submissions. 

19Mr Patrick called Abbie White as his primary witness. He also called Detective Senior Constable [name withheld] as the police officer in charge of the case. In addition he called Mary Brown, a person to whom Abbie White complained about what she said had been going on. He also called Abbie White's mother, Susan White. 

20Ms O'Reilly tendered some evidence as exhibits in her client's case but called no witnesses. The fact that she called no witnesses I regard in the same way as the fact that she did not call her client to give evidence. Her client is presumed innocent and no adverse conclusion can be drawn against him by the fact that he elects, through his counsel, not to call any witnesses in his case.

21Mr Patrick tendered the DVD of the record of interview between the police and Peter Taupe and a photograph depicting the lounge room of a particular house where Abbie White and her family were living at a particular time. 

22Ms O'Reilly tendered two photographs depicting members of the family including Abbie White at particular times and a bundle of notes which were made either by Abbie White or by her mother as part of the process whereby Abbie White attempted to recollect what had happened to her and when. 

23I think the first important finding that I should make is about Abbie White as a witness. I took careful note of the way she gave evidence, of her demeanour in court, of the content of her answers and the kind of answers she gave. My observations, which I had noted down during the course of her evidence, included these. She was a very careful witness. She was clear about what she knew and did not know and was frank when confronted by evidence which apparently contradicted what she said. She was not defensive. She made distinctions between what she could and could not remember. She was a thoughtful witness and I detected no evasion or prevarication in the way that she gave evidence. A number of times I noted that in giving her answers she was calm and clear. 

24Mr Patrick made a submission about Abbie White's evidence which I will set out. In [3] of his written submissions (which were marked for identification 13) he said the following -

""It is submitted that the complainant is a truthful and reliable witness who has done her best to give an honest account of the events that occurred to her as a child. In assessing the complainant's evidence it should be remembered that she gave evidence in Court detailing a lengthy history of abuse at the hands of the accused. The complainant was then cross examined thoroughly and professionally by the defence counsel. This process of giving evidence was a testing one but which presented the complainant in a positive light. She did not evade questions, she did not seek to cover up if she had no memory of events, her answers were consistent between evidence in chief and cross examination and she demonstrated a clear memory of the events she was referring to. In particular the complainant demonstrated a very strong memory of the offences as she got older.""

I largely accept what the Crown Prosecutor has said in that submission. I will refer later to her memory and specifically of what it was for. In particular I adopt Mr Patrick's submission about the cross-examination. It was thorough, persistent and very competent. 

25Subject to matters which I will come to shortly, I accept Abbie White as a truthful and, to the extent that she was able to be, a reliable witness. She was a very impressive person who gave her evidence, as I said, in a calm and clear way, particularly given what she was giving evidence about and the thorough cross-examination which she underwent. 

26As I have said, I have been very much assisted by the submissions of both counsel. It is very important to note in this regard that Ms O'Reilly made it clear both at the commencement of the case and in her written and oral submissions that ""while it is acknowledged that criminal misconduct has been committed by the accused, we deny that the complainant's account of when the conduct occurred, where it occurred and precisely what occurred is flawed in the way identified in the defence closing submissions."" Although there appears to be a double negative in that sentence it is obvious to me that the three important issues were when conduct occurred, where it occurred and what had occurred. 

27It was submitted that Ms White's evidence was flawed in particular ways. Ms O'Reilly focused on a particular process by which Abbie White recollected the events. When she first went to the police on 25 July 2010 the police officer very sensibly told her to put together a time line of what had happened to her and then to come back to see the police to be interviewed formally. Ms White did this over a day or a weekend with her mother. The process of this occurring was the subject of a good deal of cross-examination. Abbie White made it clear consistently that her mother contributed nothing to what had happened to Abbie White so far as the sexual assaults were concerned. That must make sense because it is not claimed that Mrs White was a witness. But what Abbie White did make clear was that Mrs White had assisted her daughter with the gathering of collateral information such as photographs, certificates and documents which would assist Abbie White in doing just what the police officer had asked her to do, namely, to put together a time line. Ms O'Reilly submitted that the evidence of Abbie White was ""not direct recollection but reconstructed memories derived"" from the occasion when she spent the time with her mother. Ms O'Reilly submitted that Mrs White ""played a pivotal and central role in the reconstruction of the memories, she not only took notes she also contributed dates and other things. The only clear evidence regarding the source of dates is not that the complainant unilaterally remembers those dates, but that her mother assisted her in obtaining them."" Ms O'Reilly drew attention to answers given by Abbie White in cross-examination to the effect that, other than two particular events identified by reference to [place] and Ben's birthday, Abbie White had no memory of when the particular incidents occurred. Ms O'Reilly pointed out that Abbie White acknowledged that she had no independent recollection of dates without her mother's help. 

28It must be very difficult for a young woman who needs to go about recollecting events, such as Abbie White was doing, pinpointing exactly when and where they occurred. In cases such as this, the allegations are that they occurred over an extended number of years and over a time when the person was very young and growing into teenage years. In my opinion Abbie White was given good advice by Detective Senior Constable [name withheld] to put together a time line. How else, I ask rhetorically, would she be able to place the particulars in time. 

29I accept Abbie White's evidence that her mother made no contribution to her recollection of what had happened so far as the sexual assaults were concerned. 

30This is an area where I have to exercise caution because of the issues which have been raised by Ms O'Reilly. First is the fact that Abbie White is the principal and exclusive source of evidence regarding the particular allegations which are contained in the indictment. Secondly, she has gone through a process of recollecting which involves another person. It seems to me that a person may have a clear recollection of what happened plus some other accompanying circumstance but may not recollect the date at all. It would be reasonable in such a case for a person to check the date of the circumstance. For example, a person may remember an event occurring at a time of a widely publicised event. An example occurred in this case. During the record of interview Mr Taupe was asked questions about when he was at his brother's unit. It was suggested to him that it was the year 2000. His own recollection was that it was 2001, because he recollected discussing with his brother in the unit the events which occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001. I merely use that as a convenient example. A complainant in a sexual assault case may remember clearly an assault that occurred, including its details. The complainant may also remember a particular event occurring at the same time. It would not raise a doubt in my mind if the complainant had checked a newspaper regarding the approximate date of when the assault had occurred by reference to the account given in the newspaper of the well publicised accompanying circumstance. Nevertheless, I have to be very careful about what emerged from the joint conference between Abbie White and her mother.

31I also have to be careful because of two other points made by Ms O'Reilly. Ms O'Reilly pointed out that often Abbie White makes reference to what are called memory triggers; that is events identified by Abbie White which enable her to recollect when a particular assault occurred. Ms O'Reilly pointed out that the evidence of those memory triggers is not sufficiently detailed in the prosecution case. In addition she argued that I must exercise care in the interaction between those triggers and the very events which Abbie White claims occurred to her. Ms O'Reilly argued that I might entertain some doubt about whether or not the triggers, whatever they were, ""do accurately and reliably relate to the memory that the complainant testifies having"". I have to be careful as to ""whether or not the triggers have consolidated a memory that would otherwise be uncertain (thereby influencing the memory to an unacceptable degree).""

32Ms O'Reilly submitted that Abbie White had lied about a particular issue. The issue was the first use of the word ""labia"" to describe part of her genitals in the evidence. In Ms O'Reilly's written submissions (which became marked for identification 14) she pointed to some inconsistency in the evidence about when the word was first used. She argued that Abbie White ""was not being truthful with the Court about this aspect of her evidence."" Ms O'Reilly argued that Abbie White had a motive for avoiding attributing the first use of the word to her mother, rather than to the police officer. 

33I do not accept that submission. This was an example of where Abbie White, once confronted by apparently contradictory evidence, made what seemed to me to be a frank acknowledgment accompanied by an explanation. I detected no sense whatsoever either in her evidence or in the way that she was presenting it that she was trying to manipulate the impression that she was giving and avoid attributing more reliance to her mother. Nor do I put any weight on the submission advanced by Ms O'Reilly that Abbie White was more fluent and forthright in her evidence on the second day of the trial than the first day.

34In addition, I do not accept the submission that there is anything untoward in the descriptions of each count being very similar. Ms O'Reilly argued that in some of her evidence the answers were ""almost rote"" and that there was ""little or no variation between the complaints, in her evidence she said that he touched her vaginal area, parted the labia and penetrated her.""

35I do not accept that that submission reduces the weight of Abbie White's evidence. This is because it seemed both from a description by Mr Taupe himself, in what he acknowledged he had done, and in Abbie White's own evidence that much of the offending behaviour of Peter Taupe was consistent. There was little or no variation except, as Abbie White acknowledged, as she got older when the nature of the offending behaviour seemed to escalate.

36I do not accept that there is any serious inconsistency between the statements given by Abbie White to the police and her evidence in court. Ms O'Reilly argued that Abbie White was ""unable in her evidence to give details that she had given in depth in her police statement."" They were significant details, Ms O'Reilly argued. It is one thing for a police statement to be taken, as this one was, over several days in a room in a police station. It is another thing for an account to be given without the assistance of those statements in the witness box under oath or affirmation and under cross-examination over several days. 

37So far as the record of interview given by Mr Taupe to the police is concerned, I accept the admissions which he made which are against his interest. The admissions are consistent with him sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the admissions are true and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the admissions amount to proof of a tendency to touch Abbie White's vagina.

38In addition, the admissions support Abbie White's account that she was sexually assaulted. They do not necessarily support her account of when and where those assaults occurred but I am of the opinion that the admissions support Abbie White's account that on occasions she was digitally penetrated by Peter Taupe. 

39Although Mr Taupe denies in his interview any behaviour which amounted to penetrating Abbie White's vagina with his finger, he acknowledged that on two occasions he had ""tried to penetrate but she said it hurts and I stopped."" I do not have to accept Mr Taupe's account in its entirety. I accept his admissions against interest. I think that he is being defensive about the extent to which more serious conduct such as penetration occurred and on how many times. His admissions however about his attempts at penetration accompanied by pain on the part of the victim of those attempts is clearly consistent, in my opinion, with penetration to the extent required by law to amount to sexual intercourse. I accept that this account given in his interview was generally, as Mr Patrick described it, vague and imprecise. I am not sure whether that is because he was being defensive about the extent of his behaviour or whether he had blocked out some of the behaviour. He acknowledged during the interview that he was seeing a counsellor about his behaviour. 

40I accept Mr Patrick's submission about the occasion during the course of the trial when Abbie White acknowledged that she had a conversation with her mother outside the Court about a particular topic she was being cross-examined about. Mr Patrick acknowledged, in [31] of his written submissions, ""that whilst she should not have spoken to her mother the complainant admitted her error and it is submitted that no adverse inference should be drawn in relation to the complainant's actions."" I did not get the impression that Abbie White was having any more conversations with people outside the courtroom, or overnight, greater than the ones which she readily acknowledged.

41In light of those submissions I turn now to consider the specific counts and the evidence on those counts. 

42Counts 1 and 2 claim that Mr Taupe indecently assaulted Abbie White between 1 April 1996 and 30 September 1996. In evidence-in-chief Abbie White said, so far as count 1 was concerned, that she was ""roughly eight"" years old. She said, so far as the weather was concerned, that ""it was cold or cool"". She acknowledged in cross-examination that her memory of 1996 was ""very wobbly"" and ""very shaky"" as to the year. She said that count 2 occurred roughly a month or so after count 1 and it was ""still cold"" and ""late winter"". Abbie White acknowledged in cross-examination that so far as the earlier counts were concerned she had possibly mixed up the years and that she had provided very general descriptions when she was young. 

43In a case where it was made clear by Ms O'Reilly that the dates when events occurred was an important issue in the case, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events described by Abbie White as occurring in counts 1 and 2 occurred when she said that they did.

44Counts 3 and 4 are in the alternative. They are said to have occurred between 1 November 1996 and 28 February 1997. Count 3 is an allegation of sexual intercourse and the alternative count 4 is an allegation of an indecent assault. In evidence-in-chief Abbie White said that she could not say ""for certain"" whether the event was in ""January or February of '97"", or ""December '97"". So far as her age was concerned, she said that she ""would have been nine, nineish"". The counts claim that she was eight years of age. In cross-examination she acknowledged, so far as those counts were concerned, that she had guessed the age from a photograph. 

45I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has discharged its responsibility of proving that what Abbie White said occurred, did occur during the period in question alleged in counts 3 and 4.

46Counts 5 and 6 are also in the alternative. They are said to have occurred between 1 May 1997 and 31 October 1997. Abbie White claimed to have been 9 years old. In the evidence-in-chief Abbie White said that the event occurred in ""winter"" and that she remembered it ""being cold"". That evidence was no doubt consistent with the claim of dates between 1 May and 31 October 1997. However, in cross-examination she said that 9 years was ""roughly the age from my memory"". She repeated that assertion. She acknowledged that she could have been 10 years old and that her memory was not totally clear. 

47Given that evidence I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the event which Abbie White said occurred - and referred to in counts 5 and 6 - in fact occurred between the dates the prosecution claimed.

48The prosecution acknowledged, through Mr Patrick, that there is no evidence for me to find Mr Taupe guilty of either counts 7 or 8. 

49Counts 9 and 10 allege sexual intercourse, or an alternative of an indecent assault, occurring between 1 October 1998 and 30 October 1998. That range of dates was chosen because of a reference in the evidence to the assault coinciding with Mr Taupe watching on television a car racing event at Bathurst. In evidence-in-chief Abbie White referred to her still playing basketball to year 5; she believed to the end of year 5. She said that she ""would have been 11"". The charge in fact claims that she was 10. She said further in evidence-in-chief: ""I believe this was '98, around, I believe it was around [place]"". 

50Ms O'Reilly cross-examined Abbie White about what Ms O'Reilly claimed were inconsistent accounts given by her of her behaviour during the assault. In evidence Abbie White said that she flinched. However in her statement she said that she did not move. She acknowledged in cross-examination that one of them was not true and she also acknowledged that her memories had changed over time and that there had been some blurring or meshing of the memories. She acknowledged that it was a bit confusing for her in the witness box under pressure. However on the other hand she has a distinct memory of whom she was playing with at that particular time. 

51I was very nearly so convinced of the account as to find Mr Taupe guilty of one of these charges. However, I had some reservations about her acknowledgement that there had been some blurring or meshing of memories and that her memories had been tangled to a degree. But of most significance is the fact that the prosecution correctly called evidence that there were, in fact, two car races in Bathurst in 1998; one was on 4 October 1998, the other on 15 November 1998. 

52The count in the indictment claimed that the offences occurred between 1 October and 30 October 1998. I therefore cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, in a case where it is made clear by the defence that dates are an important issue, that the account given by Abbie White did not relate to the car race which occurred in Bathurst on 15 November 1998. In addition, as I say, I have some reservations about other answers which she gave in cross-examination. I am therefore not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Taupe is guilty of the counts which are contained in counts 9 and 10 of the indictment. 

53Count 11 is an allegation of sexual intercourse when Abbie White was 10 years old. (All the sexual intercourse allegations, I should add, refer to digital penetration.) Count 11 claims that this offence occurred between 1 January 1999 and 30 January 1999. In her evidence-in-chief regarding count 11 Abbie White was asked by Mr Patrick whether ""after the Bathurst races, do you recall any other instances occurring in the years that followed?"" Her answer was, ""I remember any 1999, in January, early 99 - uhm - sorry -"". However in cross-examination on this topic, Abbie White acknowledged that it was the pyjamas that she was wearing at the time which were the only feature which she was able to attribute to that occasion and that it could possibly have occurred at another time. She also acknowledged that when giving evidence she was confused and that the details of one incident may have blurred with others. 

54I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the event which Abbie White claimed occurred during the time alleged in count 11 occurred then. 

55Count 12 alleges that Peter Taupe sexually assaulted Abbie White by digital penetration between 1 March 2000 and 30 June 2000 at [place]. The significance of [place] was that it was the time when Mr Taupe had moved out of the home he occupied with Abbie White and her mother and other children and had moved into a flat with his brother. The allegation, as I said, focuses on the period from 1 March to 30 June 2000. In her evidence-in-chief Abbie White said that Mr Taupe had moved out ""roughly in 2000"" to live with his brother in the [place] flat. She added that she would say that it was autumn, it was not hot or cold and she would say that it was before her birthday. 

56Count 13 - which I will consider at the same time - is related in the sense that it is said to have occurred when Mr Taupe was living outside the family home, still with his brother, but this time in [place]. It is said to have occurred between 1 May and 30 September 2000. So far as the time was concerned, Abbie White's evidence was that it occurred ""a few months later"" than the events in count 12 and that it occurred in winter 2000 ""roughly in the middle of winter"". 

57However in this regard I take into account the answer given by Mr Taupe in his record of interview when asked about the events which were said to have occurred around autumn 2000. He was asked by the police officer whether he had separated from Abbie White's mother in 2000 which was the year of the Olympics. His answer was - and it was an answer to question 108 -

""No I think it was, I think it was 2001 and the reason I say that was because I remember distinctly that I was sittin' on the, on the lounge having breakfast in the morning when the 9/11 thing come through and the house that my brother and I were sharing and yeah, that come through on the news. We thought it was a movie.""

He acknowledged, of course, that was September 2001. 

58I accept what Mr Taupe said about that event and that - together with the vague descriptions by Abbie White of when counts 12 and 13 occurred - means that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults which are alleged to have occurred in those counts did in fact occur at the time claimed. 

59I will move now to count 15 which is a claim of sexual intercourse between 1 December and 31 December 2000. Abbie White's evidence was that it was ""around Christmas time"" and that it was ""Christmas of 2000"" but she went on to say that ""I can't say if it was Christmas. I remember it was roughly around the festive season."" 

60Similarly with count 16, which is another sexual assault also alleged to have occurred between 1 December and 31 December 2000, she said that it was ""around Christmas"". Those two offences are specifically pleaded to have occurred within a period of 31 days. Once again Ms O'Reilly has made it clear that the period of time during which any offences have occurred is a very important aspect of the case. 

61I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an account such as ""around Christmas"" and ""roughly around the festive season"" satisfy me that the events, the subject of those counts, occurred at the time when they are alleged. 

62I move now to count 18 which is an allegation of sexual intercourse between 1 April 2002 and 30 September 2002. One event of significance in that year was the death of Abbie White's grandmother on 18 May 2003. She recalled that her grandmother had a stroke in January of that year. Mrs White - Susan White, her mother, who was called to give evidence - said that her mother had had Alzheimer's for some 5 years but did not mention a stroke in January of that year. The best evidence of when the events in count 18 occurred was given in evidence-in-chief when Abbie White said that it was ""sort of cool. So, I'm going to say winter-ish."" 

63I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that description of the time can prove that the events the subject of count 18 occurred when claimed. 

64Count 19 concerns a claim of sexual intercourse which occurred between 1 December and 31 December 2003, once again a period of 31 days. Abbie White remembers that she was 15 and they had moved to a suburb of [place] named [place]. The best evidence she was able to give of when that event occurred was ""in summer months, December"". She repeated in evidence-in-chief ""December, the summer months"". 

65Once again, given the nature of the defence that the periods in time are important, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, with that general description of the period of time, that the events which are the subject of count 19 did, in fact, occur between 1 December and 31 December 2003. 

66I return now to counts 14, 17 and 20. All three of those claimed sexual assaults are different in their descriptions of when they occurred than the others. Count 14 concerns an allegation of sexual intercourse which is said to have occurred between 1 December 2000 and 31 December 2000 when Abbie White was 12. It is claimed that she was under Peter Taupe's authority at the time. Abbie White's recollection of when that offence occurred is this. (It comes from this series of questions and answers at T 42 in evidence-in-chief.)

""Q. This is your brother Ben?
A. Yes.

Q. What is his date of birth?
A. [withheld], so he is four years older than me.

Q. Can you remember what happened to you on this occasion? What were the circumstances of your stepfather being at your home?
A. I recall on that occasion, I'm not too sure if it was my brother's actual birthday, or the day after, or the day before, but I remember we got up in the morning and as my mum got up she opened the roller shutter on the front of the windows. I remember jumping into bed to see what we were doing that day."" 

67Abbie White went on to describe that Peter Taupe started to touch her and that he ""went under my underpants and would start to touch my vagina and penetrate - part the labia and penetrate me with his finger."" She agreed that he had penetrated her vagina and that it was ""around your brother's birthday."" She had earlier said that on this particular occasion Mr Taupe had come over to their house (he had been living separately at that stage) and that ""he brought my brother a car for his sixteenth birthday."" 

68I repeat that Abbie White was quite specific that it was either the day before or the day after or specifically on her brother's birthday. In this regard, Mr Taupe, in his record of interview, acknowledges that he had bought Ben a car. He could not say when, nor could he say what birthday it was for, or whether it was for a birthday, but he acknowledged buying Ben a car. 

69In addition, Abbie White recollected that, for what I infer to be her sixteenth birthday, Mr Taupe had ""brought me my first car."" That was at T 55. Later at T128, she said that she had received a particular car ""for my sixteenth birthday"". 

70I acknowledge that it is possible that Abbie White's mother may have suggested the event of the car being given to Ben on his sixteenth birthday. I do not regard that as a fact which would influence or raise any doubt about the date. It is similar to the example about the newspaper which I gave earlier. In addition, I am reinforced by the acknowledgement by Mr Taupe that he had given a car to Ben, although he did not say whether it was a birthday present and, if so, when, but I am also influenced by the fact that he had given Abbie White herself a car for her sixteenth birthday. 

71Given that I accept Abbie White's accounts of the events which had occurred, I find that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at some stage between 1 December and 31 December 2000 at [place], Peter Taupe had sexual intercourse by digitally penetrating Abbie White and that, at that stage, she was 12 years of age. He was her stepfather and there is evidence that she regarded him as her father: I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was under his authority. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of her age.

72Count 17 claims that Peter Taupe had sexual intercourse with Abbie White between [withheld] 2001. It says that Abbie White was between 10 and 16 years of age, namely either 12 or 13. I accept the evidence of Abbie White and of her mother that Abbie White was born on [withheld], so that she turned 13 on [withheld]. 

73Abbie White's description of this particular claim is associated with a very particular memory. She said in evidence-in-chief that she ""got my period the week of my thirteenth birthday, in 2001"". She acknowledged that it was in [withheld] 2001. Her mother and Mr Taupe were still living separately. She remembered ""It was the week of my birthday. I remember my birthday party on the weekend. I can't remember if my birthday was the weekend day or not, but I think the next week I remember Peter coming over. I remember he touched me again in the vaginal area."" She went on to say that ""he touched my vaginal area and he parted the labia and penetrated me with his finger."" She remembered that he was ""a bit more forceful again, or aggressive, and he sort of positioned or adjusted my legs, I guess you could say."" She agreed that he had penetrated her vagina with one of his fingers. She thought that it was after she had commenced her period. She acknowledged, unsurprisingly, that she had a good memory of when she first got her period. She thought she was sick and went to see her mother to show her underwear to her mother. Her mother was on the phone and said ""Oh my God, Abbie has got her period."" Abbie White said that she felt embarrassed because she did not know whom her mother was speaking to. In cross-examination, she said that she had her birthday and then the period was a week later. 

74Given that I accept Abbie White's evidence and given the specificity and the significance of the event which she recollects in this case, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, between [withheld] 2001 at [place], Peter Taupe had sexual intercourse with Abbie White by digitally penetrating her, and that she was either 12 or 13 years of age. She was, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, under his authority at the time. 

75Count 20 claims that Peter Taupe digitally penetrated Abbie White between 1 January 2004 and 3 May 2004. In her evidence-in-chief she was asked whether she recalled ""the last time that anything ever happened to you"". She replied ""Yes. It was a couple of months after December 2003, so it would have been early the next year, or 2004."" She said that she was still 15, which means of course that it was before her birthday on [withheld] 2004. She said that it was ""a weekend once again, so a Saturday"". She said that Peter Taupe ""progressed to put his hands over my vaginal area under my underwear, parted the labia, and penetrated me with his fingers in the vaginal area. This time he did insert a second finger."" He inserted first one finger and then slid in a second. She said it was uncomfortable and was painful. She recalls wearing underwear and recalls that on this occasion ""he removed them down to my ankles, down the lower half of my legs."" That had never happened before. He had moved them to the side before but ""he'd never actually moved them off my - off where they're meant to be."" That was the last time, she said, that anything happened to her. 

76There are a number of features about that allegation which mean that the prosecution has satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt of its truth. First, it was the last occasion that anything happened. Secondly, Abbie White was significantly older, namely she was nearly 16. Thirdly, it occurred within a year of the family moving into another home at [place]. Fourthly, Abbie White was able to identify the relevant period with some precision, it was in 2004 and before her birthday. Fifthly, he had inserted two fingers rather than one. Sixthly, he had removed her underpants down to her ankles. 

77There is one issue about that last event which was the subject of submissions by Ms O'Reilly and Mr Patrick. When Abbie White was interviewed by the police on her first visit (25 July 2010), an entry was made by the interviewing police officer on the police computer system. That entry records the offences concluding in 2001. I accept Mr Patrick's submission that this record was made at the first meeting with the police. It was also before Abbie White was asked to ""go home and do a timeline"". It was before Abbie White did a detailed statement during which she could consider the timeline in detail. It is, I accept, as Mr Patrick said, ""unsurprising that after that consideration the complainant was able to provide detailed information such as that referred to"" later on. 

78The reference in the police computer system to 2001 does not leave me with a reasonable doubt about when the events the subject of count 20 occurred. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, between 1 January 2004 and 3 May 2004 at [place], Peter Taupe had sexual intercourse with Abbie White when she was between 14 and 16 years of age, namely 15, and that at the time she was under his authority. 

79Accordingly, I acquit Peter Taupe of counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 19 in the indictment. I convict him of counts 14, 17 and 20 in the indictment.

80I do not know whether there are people here - there may be - unconnected with this case. I have been mentioning names - the surname White, either Abbie White or Susan White, and the name Peter Taupe. It is illegal and a criminal offence to refer to those names outside this courtroom unless you are connected with the case. They are not to be spoken about, those names, outside the courtroom. The idea is that the identity of the person complaining about sexual assault, Abbie White in this case, is to be protected and not broadcast.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Jubb and Ms O'Reilly, where does that leave us?
JUBB: My understanding, your Honour, is that there will be an application to adjourn for sentence.
HIS HONOUR: That's what my understanding is. And an application for bail?
O'REILLY: Yes, your Honour.
JUBB: Your Honour, I think it has been indicated before that there will be no objection to bail continuing.
HIS HONOUR: That's the case, Mr Jubb.
JUBB: But my request - and I think it has already been vented before - that there be an additional condition for the defendant to report to his local police station on three days each week. 
HIS HONOUR: Ms O'Reilly, reporting three days a week?
O'REILLY: Yes, there is no issue with that. 
HIS HONOUR: Okay.
O'REILLY: Monday, Wednesday and Friday to--
HIS HONOUR: Which one?
O'REILLY: [place].
HIS HONOUR: Good, okay.
JUBB: I can inform the Court also there are no previous convictions known against the defendant.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Okay.
JUBB: Your Honour, I know that Mr Patrick is not available until May, but I understand that the case may need to be dealt with well ahead of that.
HIS HONOUR: All right, I will just get my diary. I have just got to add to my reasons because I just saw a note which I had overlooked referring to--

81Both parties referred me to the provisions of s 165B of the Evidence Act 1995. Ms O'Reilly made a submission that her client suffered a significant forensic disadvantage because of the delay in making the complaint. The disadvantages include his capacity to obtain relevant documents such as work records and to trace the breakdown or resumption of his relationship with Abbie White's mother. There were wide periods in the allegations, she said, which meant that he was at difficulty in remembering back that far and in pinpointing what he was doing. 

82So far as the counts of which I have convicted Mr Taupe are concerned, I do not regard any forensic disadvantage as influencing me as to his being guilty or not guilty. It was a case where he acknowledged that he had sexually assaulted his stepdaughter and that he had attempted to penetrate her. I have accepted that Abbie White is a witness who is telling the truth. I accept her account of what happened on the three occasions that I have found him guilty. I do not regard any disadvantage which Mr Taupe may have suffered as affecting that conclusion.

ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 5 APRIL 2013 FOR SENTENCE

		18 August 2014",2013-12-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763035,State of New South Wales v Atkins [2013] NSWSC 1988,"Judgment
1By summons filed 28 November 2013, the plaintiff seeks a Continuing Detention Order (""CDO"") and, in the alternative and Extended Supervision Order governing the defendant, Bruce Allan Atkins.  The summons also seeks interim orders (""IDO"" and ""ISO"" respectively) pending the final hearing of the matter.  The Court, on 20 December 2013, made orders, including an ISO with which the defendant must comply.  These are the reasons for those orders.
2The parties confined the issues between them.  It is necessary, however, to recite some facts.
3The defendant was, at the time the ISO issued, still in custody.  He had pleaded guilty to two offences of aggravated indecent assault (victim under 16 years) and one offence of indent assault (victim under 10 years).  He was serving a sentence that was due to expire on 26 December 2013.
4The defendant has a history of sexual offences.  He also suffers from an intellectual disability and continued to deny the index offences.  He was denied parole, inter alia, because of the lack of suitable accommodation in the community.
Principles
5The Court is dealing with an interim order and not finally determining the rights or appropriate order, if any, to be made on a final basis.  The Court is required, within 28 days of application, to conduct a preliminary hearing and may make and ISO or IDO if satisfied that the matters in the supporting documents, if proved, would justify the making of a CSO or CDO: see ss 10A and 18A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2007 (""the Act""); Attorney-General for NSW v Hayter [2007] NSWSC 983.
6The task of the Court at a preliminary hearing is similar to the task in committal proceedings, but does not involve proof beyond reasonable doubt: Hayter.  It does, however, require proof at a higher standard than the mere balance of probabilities: Cornwall v Attorney-General for NSW [2007] NSWCA 374.
7The primary object of the Act is to ensure the safety and protection of the community (s 3(1)) and the facilitation and encouragement of rehabilitation (s 3(2)).  The Act is not punitive and, subject to the terms of the Act, persons who have served a sentence for an offence are entitled to be at liberty.
8Ultimately, for an order of any kind sought to be issued, the Court is required to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that an offender, the defendant in the proceedings, poses an unacceptable risk of committing, relevantly, a serious sex offence unless kept under supervision (s 5B of the Act).  If the Court were also satisfied that adequate supervision could not be provided by an ESO, the Court may make a CDO (s 5D).  The provisions are facilitative and evaluative; not discretionary.
The defendant's circumstances
9The defendant's criminal record is before the Court.  The defendant was convicted of: minor stealing offences between 1977 and 1982; set fire with intent to murder in 1983; stealing and possession of a prescribed restricted substance (the items stolen included, relevantly, 19 pairs of children's or women's underpants) in 1984; act of indecency towards person under 10 years in 1991; and, in 2007, the index offences of aggravated indecent assault.
10It is appropriate to summarise briefly the 1991 offence and the index offences.  The 1991 offence occurred when the defendant exposed his penis to the victim and rubbed it on the top of her legs.  The victim was six years old at the time.  She was the daughter of Ms R with whom the defendant had commenced a relationship about five or six months earlier.
11The defendant was convicted after trial and continues to maintain his innocence.
12The index offences occurred when a friend (Mrs B) of Ms R (with whom the defendant had continued in a relationship) visited the premises occupied by the defendant and Ms R.  Mrs B visited the premises with her daughters aged 12, 9, 7, and 5 years of age.
13On 5 January 2007, Mrs B visited with her 9-year-old daughter who was recovering from an operation on her leg and needed to utilise crutches.  At about 3pm, Ms R and Mrs B went to collect Mrs B's other daughters from school, leaving the recovering 9-year-old with the defendant.
14During the period alone, the defendant removed his pants and underwear, lay on top of the child (after having removed her underwear and raised her skirt) and rubbed his penis on her labia (outside the vagina).  The child pushed him away, after several attempts, after which the defendant threatened her by saying, ""If you tell anyone, I'll kill you"".
15The next day, the defendant and Ms R visited Mrs B's home.  At about 7pm, Mrs B went to the hospital for an hour, accompanied by Ms R.  The defendant informed the four children that he, the defendant, needed to speak to the 12-year-old.  He told the others to go to the backroom and lay behind her, threatening that if she were to inform anyone, he would hurt her.
16Later that evening, the 12-year-old went to her bedroom.  The defendant locked the other children outside in the backyard, went to the oldest child's bedroom, took off his pants, took off her shorts and underwear and lay between her legs.  She asked him to stop.  He had already threatened her.
17One of the other children, who had managed to enter the house, saw what was happening through the gap in the door.  On Mrs B's return, both the 9-year-old and 12-year-old informed Mrs B of the events of that evening and the evening before.  Mrs B rang the police.
18The defendant pleaded guilty to the two counts of aggravated indecent assault (victim under 16) and one count of indecent assault (victim under 10).  Notwithstanding the plea of guilty, the defendant maintains his innocence.
19The defendant has offended while on conditional liberty but not during the last two extended periods (May 1986 to November 1990 and March to September 1993).  The defendant was refused parole, although of good behaviour during incarceration, because of the perceived risk arising from his non-attendance at an appropriate therapeutic programme, and dure to accommodation issues.
20I note that his non-attendance was due to his assessed ineligibility for the courses on offer.  There seems to have been no course available for a sex offender, of his kind, who both denies guilt and has an intellectual disability.  (There are programmes available for persons who possess one of those attributes, but not both.)
21Further, until very recently, the perceived risk was exacerbated by the proposal that the defendant return to reside with Ms R.
22The Court has before it, notwithstanding the interim nature of these proceedings, a number of reports from psychiatrists and psychologists, most compiled for sentencing purposes and for that reason some are quite out of date.
23The latest report of that kind was dated 6 June 2012 and was provided for parole purposes.  The psychologist, Ms Celia Langton, assesses the defendant as having a high risk of sexual reoffending.
24A report was also compiled specifically for the purposes of these proceedings by Mr Patrick Sheehan, Senior Forensic Psychologist at Corrective Services.  Parts of that report were not pressed by the plaintiff.
25Mr Sheehan also assesses the defendant ""in the high risk category relative to other men who have sexually offended"".  He recommends, or expects, ""intensive supervision and case management"" by Corrective Services, if the defendant were subject to an ESO.  I have read each of the tendered reports and rely on them in reaching my conclusions (except those parts that were not pressed).
Conclusion
26First, from the foregoing and the material before the Court, it is clear that there is jurisdiction to make either of the orders sought (or there existed jurisdiction at the time the orders issued), namely, the defendant is a high risk sex offender: s 5B of the Act.  Further, the requirements of s 6 of the Act have been satisfied.
27Any assessment of the defendant, on a preliminary basis on the material before the Court, would conclude that, if that material were proved, one or other category of EDO or ESO would be justified: s 16(1)(b) of the Act.
28For the purposes of making an interim order, I give greater weight to risk avoidance: Attorney-General for NSW v Winters [2007] NSWSC 311 at [7], per Bell J.
29I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision.
30The major issue, on the submissions of the parties and the material before the Court, is whether the appropriate order is an IDO or an ISO.  There are factors pointing in each direction. 
31One of the most important factors was the proposal that the defendant return to reside with Ms R.  If that proposal were to have continued, I have no hesitation in remarking that an IDO would have issued.  That proposal was altered.
32The current proposal is that the defendant reside in a Community Offender Support Program (""COSP"") Centre operated by Corrective Services.  As a consequence, there would be no likelihood of children living on the premises or being on the premises unsupervised.  This is a most significant factor.
33Another significant aspect is the defendant's stated refusal to medicate with anti-libidinal drugs.  Currently, there is no evidence that the defendant's past offending is a manifestation of sexual desire.  There are a number of reasons that such offending may occur.
34The report of Ms Young on 18 August 2008, provided for sentencing for the index offences, suggests that the offending may be referrable to the defendant's assessment of his intellectual disability.  (The defendant has a reading ability approximating a 5-year-old and is in the lowest 2.2% of the population in intellectual functioning.)  Ms Young notes that the offending may disclose intimacy deficits under which the defendant identifies with children, rather than adults.  In each offence, the defendant expressed ""his love"" for the victim.
35It is not necessary, in making an interim detention order, for the Court to be satisfied that a supervision order would not suffice.  Such a determination is necessary when final orders are to be made.
36Nevertheless, the intimacy deficits to which I have referred are consistent with the pattern of offending.  The risk of offending based on such issues is significantly reduced by the accommodation of the defendant at the COSP Centre and, at least on an interim basis, ameliorates the concerns associated with the defendant's lack of insight into his behaviour and the refusal to abide by any prescribed anti-libidinal medication.
37For those reasons, I was satisfied that an ISO, as distinct from an IDO, should issue.  For the same reasons, and to ensure that the Court is better informed at the final hearing, an order under s 15(4) of the Act, appointing two psychiatrists, also issued.
38No issue was taken with the conditions proposed in the ISO, if it were to issue.  The conditions proposed were both reasonable and appropriate.
39As a consequence, on 20 December 2013, the Court issued orders substantially in the terms of prayers 1 and 6 of the Summons filed by the plaintiff on 28 November 2013.

2763036,Hudson v R [2013] NSWDC 287,"Judgment

1At 12:45 am in the morning of Saturday 3 November 2012 a police officer saw a car trying to run a red light here in Queanbeyan, indeed very close to this courthouse. She pursued the car with her lights on to a place where the car stopped. A passenger got out followed a few seconds later by the driver. They both ran away. The police officer later identified the passenger and the driver. The driver was charged as a result of that identification with an offence against s 51B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): not stopping during a police pursuit and driving at speed. The driver defended the case but the magistrate who heard the case was satisfied of his guilt and convicted him. 

2The driver - whose name is Luke Hudson - has appealed to the District Court against the conviction which was entered by his Honour Magistrate Bone in the Queanbeyan Local Court on 14 October 2013. 

3Following the usual procedure I have read the relevant parts of the transcript and the exhibits which were before his Honour and I have had the benefit of written and oral submissions by Mr P Herrald who appears for Mr Hudson and oral submissions by Ms K Stanley who appeared for the respondent to the appeal who is the Director of Public Prosecutions. Magistrate Bone delivered written reasons for his Honour's decision and the legal representatives of both parties agreed that his Honour had accurately summarised the evidence. 

4I should say a little more about the case. After the police officer - who was Senior Constable Stoddart - had seen the two men escape she stayed with the car. Later she was alerted about an address not far away in Queanbeyan. She went to the address and saw Luke Hudson. As soon as she saw him she claimed that he was the driver. He denied that. His account which he gave in evidence before his Honour was that he had been drinking at a local hotel with a friend of his named Mr Kitchen. He accepted the evidence that they left at about 12:30 am, perhaps a minute or two earlier. He said that he then walked home. It was at his home that Senior Constable Stoddart saw him and asserted that he was the driver. He said that the walk home had taken about 15 minutes, a little less. He actually said in evidence that he had timed the walk and it was about 12½ minutes. His drinking companion, Mr Kitchen, said in evidence that he had separated from Mr Hudson after they left the hotel and gone to another friend's place, a Mr Hourigan. As it happens Senior Constable Stoddart's evidence is that she identified Mr Hourigan as the passenger in the car which she had pursued. Mr Hourigan confirmed that Mr Kitchen had joined him and they then both went for a walk and turned up at Mr Hudson's home when the police were there. 

5Mr Hudson asserted in his evidence, as indeed he had to the police, that when he got home after the hotel he laid down on a couch, dozed off, was woken by the barking of the dog, looked and realised that a car he had been using was being stolen. He ran after it down the street but it got away. He gave up the pursuit, returned to the house and sat down and the police turned up. He immediately denied when it was put to him by Senior Constable Stoddart that he was the driver of the car that it was he who was driving. The car that he said was stolen was the same car that Senior Constable Stoddart had pursued. The car belonged to a person who lived at the place to which Mr Hudson had returned. It was not in fact his home but a place he was staying during the week. He stayed there with Mr Kitchen and Mr Kitchen's partner. Mr Kitchen's partner was away in Queensland but she had given permission for Mr Hudson to use her car in her absence. He used it to drive to and from work. 

6Ms Stanley argued that her case comprised three components. The first was the identification evidence by Senior Constable Stoddart. The second comprised various pieces of circumstantial evidence. The third was the proposition that the evidence given by Mr Hudson as well as by Mr Kitchen and Mr Hourigan should be rejected. Of course she needed to make that last submission because I have to reject at least Mr Hudson's evidence before I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt. 

7Turning to the identification evidence, it was strong in my opinion. When it is tested against the kinds of factors which a judge will alert a jury to in giving a direction about identification evidence (in compliance with cl 3-050 of the Criminal Trial Bench Book) it holds up favourably. Although Mr Hudson was a stranger and the opportunity to see him was limited and there was no evidence of the state of the lighting apart from the blue and red police lights on top of the car, the witness Senior Constable Stoddart focused her attention on the driver of the car and it was a significant, not a casual sighting. There was an aspect which impressed itself upon her, namely that the driver had red or fair hair. Although obviously under some stress and pressure at the time, the observing witness was a trained police officer. Circumstances that may be particularly stressful to a lay person - namely a pursuit in a car - will not be as stressful for a trained police officer. The training will include observations about a person's appearance. The police officer also saw Mr Hudson about half an hour later and immediately asserted that he was the driver. 

8Turning now to the circumstantial evidence, the circumstances relied upon by Ms Stanley were these. Mr Hudson had the key to the car in his pocket, or in his possession. This itself was not unusual because he was allowed to drive the car. But the key was bent. It was appropriately put to him by one or other of the police officers that it was bent because he had removed it in a hurry from the ignition when he got out of the car after being pursued by Senior Constable Stoddart. He denied this and said that it was always bent. There was some evidence given of an opinion that the bent key would not work to operate the car. However that proposition was never tested by inserting the bent key in the possession of Mr Hudson in the ignition, to see whether it started the car. 

9Senior Constable Stoddart also broadcast a description of the driver of the car over the police radio and her broadcast description coincided generally with the appearance of Mr Hudson which was captured by closed circuit television at the hotel where he had been drinking with Mr Kitchen earlier in the evening. When the police caught up with him at the place where he was staying, he no longer had a dark top but had a football t-shirt which he had taken off and discarded nearby. The police case is that he had also taken off any dark clothing which he had earlier worn at the hotel and when he was driving the car. A third piece of circumstantial evidence relied upon by Ms Stanley comes from telephone records. There were put in evidence records of the use of Mr Hudson's mobile phone. That showed a call to Queanbeyan Taxis at 12.28 am. That coincided with the evidence of Mr Kitchen and was not denied by Mr Hudson. Mr Hudson said that Mr Kitchen had borrowed his (Mr Hudson's) phone to make the call. The Queanbeyan Taxis records indicate that the taxi turned up, but there was no show on behalf of the caller. That is consistent with Mr Hudson and Mr Kitchen saying that they walked in their respective directions. 

10However, what Ms Stanley says is particularly incriminating is that over the next three quarters of an hour or so, Mr Hudson's phone records show that there are half a dozen or so calls to the phone of Mr Hourigan. It will be recalled that the police assertion is that Mr Hourigan was the passenger in the car which was pursued by Senior Constable Stoddart. The calls were generally less than a minute but one of them was for nearly eight minutes and occurred at about 1:00 am. Ms Stanley suggested that there was clearly a conversation between the person she asserted was the driver and a passenger of the car in the time after they had escaped from the car. There were about two or three calls which fall into that category and occurred after 12:45 am. 

11Another piece of circumstantial evidence relied upon by Ms Stanley is that Mr Hudson was himself in the vicinity at the time and he had the opportunity and access to the car. Finally she relies upon evidence of the police that when they were approaching the house where Mr Hudson was staying they in fact passed him on the road. They did not stop him because at that time they did not think that his appearance matched the description that had been broadcast by Senior Constable Stoddart. There was some basis for that opinion. The point made by Ms Stanley is that Mr Hudson - who was then heading back to the house after what she said was a pursuit of the stolen car - did not flag down the police and report the stolen car. Mr Hudson himself says that he had his head down and did not see the police. 

12The third limb of Ms Stanley's case is that I should reject the evidence of Mr Hudson as well as the evidence of Mr Kitchen and Mr Hourigan. She says their evidence was generally unreliable because they acknowledged that they had all been drinking a lot. But she particularly emphasised that acceptance of Mr Hudson's account would mean that he had to get from the hotel to the house where he was staying very quickly and go through the process of lying down and being awoken, all before the first sighting of the car at 12:45 am. She also pointed out that the evidence given by Mr Hourigan and Mr Kitchen was inconsistent in that the accounts given by them did not exactly coincide. 

13His Honour, in his judgment, regarded the identification evidence as ""insufficient to prove that they are one and the same person"". His Honour went on to observe that history is riddled with instances of mistaken identity. His Honour was of course complying with a direction which a jury, and I myself, must comply with in determining this case myself without a jury. As the direction says, I need to exercise ""special caution"", ""because of the possibility that a witness may be mistaken in their identification of a person accused of a crime"". I must consider very carefully the circumstances and any particular features that may render the identification evidence unreliable. As I have already said, it seems to me that a number of the features of the identification by Senior Constable Stoddart point to the process being reliable. 

14However I do take into account that there is no explicit evidence about the state of the lighting. Ms Stanley urged me to apply commonsense and conclude that the police car headlights would have been on. I do not accept that submission. Whilst I think it is likely that the headlights were on I do not know where they were facing. Indeed the evidence suggests that the police car, for tactical reasons, was pulled up at an angle to the other car. I have not been taken to any evidence about street lighting. So I am in a position where there was a sighting at night time but no evidence about the light available to the observer apart from the flashing police lights. That means I have to be particularly cautious about the identification. 

15So far as the circumstantial evidence is concerned, I note that the force of the evidence about the bent key is reduced by the fact that it was never tested. Mr Hudson asserted that he could drive the car with a bent key. The police assert that the likely explanation for the key being bent is it being pulled in a hurry from the ignition. The fact that that proposition was not tested must count against the prosecution. It is true that the general descriptions of the driver of the car coincide with how Mr Hudson appeared in the hotel but, as Mr Herrald points out, they were in very general terms. The relevance of the telephone calls between Mr Hudson and Mr Hourigan depend of course on whether Mr Hourigan was the passenger in the car. I am not satisfied that he was the passenger in the car, then the call records lose their probative significance. I will return to that shortly.

16It is true that Mr Hudson was in the vicinity and had the opportunity to commit the crime but they are the product of where he was living and his behaviour that night rather than being particularly incriminating circumstances. As I have said, Mr Hudson gave evidence, as did Mr Kitchen and Mr Hourigan. His Honour did not make a finding about the demeanour of any one of those witnesses. In other words, it seems that I have no significantly less advantage in assessing the credibility of their evidence than his Honour did. Here I must bear in mind that I would direct a jury in a case where an accused gives evidence that I must effectively reject the evidence before I can find the accused guilty. Even though I may have reservations or doubts about the evidence, if I think that there is a reasonable possibility that the accused's evidence could be true, then that reasonable possibility of truth represents a reasonable doubt. 

17In this case I do have significant reservations about Mr Hudson's evidence but he made no concessions in the cross examination that he was subjected to. His evidence held up. Some aspects were unsatisfactory. His Honour observed at one stage that it was not helpful when many of his answers were ""I don't know"". As Mr Herrald frankly acknowledged, the timing upon which his client's account depends is very tight. He had to get himself home in 10 or 15 minutes and lie down and then have the car stolen for it to turn up in town at 12:45 am. Nevertheless, as Mr Herrald points out, although tight, it is possible. 

18There are aspects about Mr Hourigan's and Mr Kitchen's evidence which are unsatisfactory. They were appropriately and fairly called as witnesses by the prosecution. It may be the case that they were therefore not subject to as vigorous cross examination as they may have otherwise been. There were inconsistencies between their evidence, but both acknowledge that they were talking about a period of time in the early hours of the morning when they had both been drinking. Neither of them made any concessions. 

19Having set out the components of the prosecution case as I just have, I have to say that I am left with a reasonable doubt about Mr Hudson's guilt. The identification evidence is strong but there is an aspect to it, namely the lighting, which reduces its cogency. The circumstantial evidence has some force but the key was not tested and Mr Hourigan gave an account in sworn evidence which was innocent. I am not of the view that I can reject Mr Hudson's evidence out of hand. So in deciding this case, those two aspects of jury directions - namely about identification and evidence given by an accused - have assumed importance. 

20I appreciate that it was a serious traffic offence and that much effort has gone into the investigation and the prosecution by the police. Nevertheless for the reasons which I have given I am left with a reasonable doubt about Mr Hudson's guilt. I propose to allow his appeal. 

21Accordingly the formal order which I make is this. Under s 20(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) I determine this appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction.

		24 February 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763050,Mammone (Pino) v R [2013] NSWCCA 325,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The applicant, Pino Mammone, seeks leave to appeal against an aggregate sentence of 9 years and 8 months, with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years and 5 months, imposed upon him following pleas of guilty to manufacture a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), and knowingly take part in the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Three further offences, namely, possessing drug manufacturing apparatus, possessing an unregistered firearm and not keep firearm safely were dealt with pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

3Each offence on indictment carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The applicant received a sentence of 9 years and 8 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months for the manufacture offence. 

4A fixed term of 4 years and 6 months was imposed contrary to law for the supply offence, and was partially accumulated on the previous sentence in order to extend the non-parole period by 6 months. Section 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which permits a court to decline to set a non-parole period, does not apply to a standard non-parole period offence: SGJ v R; Ku v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76] - [78]. The applicant does not complain that that modest degree of accumulation was not warranted in the circumstances of the case. 

5Having regard to the debate on the question of whether a fixed term otherwise represents the non-parole period or the length of the head sentence (see Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 per Hulme J), there is nothing in the remarks on sentence that explicitly indicates what the judge intended in that regard. Given that the supply offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years and that his Honour assessed the objective gravity of the supply offence in the mid range, it is reasonable to conclude that the fixed term represented the non-parole period. In the result, a re-sentencing on this basis ought make no difference to the aggregate non-parole period or aggregate sentence, assuming no other basis for intervention : Hristovkski v R [2010] NSWCCA 129 ; Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77.

6The applicant received a fixed term of one month for each of the possess pill press and unregistered firearm offences. Those sentences were accumulated upon each other and upon the fixed term for the supply offence, thereby extending the aggregate non-parole period for the offences on indictment by two months, of which one month was attributable to the possess unregistered firearm offence. There was no penalty imposed for the offence of not keep firearm safely.

7Although there was no issue taken with the structure of the sentences, the combined effect of s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s 58(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 prohibits the accumulation of the one month fixed terms on the ""existing"" sentences, because the result is that the fixed terms expire more than 5 years after the commencement of the sentence for the manufacture offence. Subject to the grounds of the appeal, it will be necessary to re-structure the sentences to remedy this defect.

8The grounds of appeal raise only two issues, namely, whether the applicant received the proper discount for his pleas of guilty and whether the sentence for the offence of possess unregistered firearm is manifestly excessive.

The Offences

Manufacture Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine

9The applicant's arrest followed a police investigation into the suspected manufacture of prohibited drugs at a rural property near the township of Marulan, north of Goulburn.

10Surveillance by police and lawfully intercepted telephone calls demonstrated that the applicant attended the property on 29 October 2009 and thereafter on a number of occasions with his cousin Franco Mammone (see Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95).

11Police executed a search warrant on 30 November 2009 and noted the presence of a quantity of equipment consistent with a clandestine laboratory for the manufacture of methylamphetamine in a shed on the property. A covert audiovisual recording device was installed in the shed on 11 December 2009.

12As a result of that device, a number of members of the extended Mammone family were recorded in connection with the manufacture of methylamphetamine. They also included one Bruno Romeo, Marcio Francisco and Kurt Minard.

13On 26 February 2010 the applicant and Kurt Minard entered the shed at the property and carried in a number of boxes. They unpacked boxes which contained glassware and chemicals capable of being used in the manufacture of methyl amphetamine. They inspected the glassware, repacked the equipment into boxes and moved some items to an adjoining room before leaving.

14On 28 February 2010 a number of telephone intercepts recorded conversations between the applicant, his cousin and another person about transporting someone referred to as the ""labour"" to the shed. The reference to the labour was a reference to Kurt Minard. Minard assisted the applicant's cousin in the manufacturing process on three occasions in March 2010.

15On 3 March 2010 the police again entered the property and retrieved the audiovisual recordings up to that time. Forensic samples of precursors to the manufacture of methylamphetamine were obtained. Police observed evidence of the recent manufacture of methylamphetamine.

16The next day, the applicant, his cousin and Romeo travelled to the property in order to commence the manufacture of methylamphetamine that afternoon. On 5 March 2010, Kurt Minard arrived at the property. All four men were recorded inside the shed whilst methylamphetamine was being manufactured. The applicant's cousin and Romeo left the property some hours before the process was completed.

17On 8 March 2010, the applicant and Kurt Minard returned to the property and entered the shed. They set up manufacturing equipment and carried out the manufacture of a quantity of methylamphetamine.

18On 10 March 2010 the police again entered the shed. Methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine were detected in various containers. A quantity of equipment and a quantity of precursor chemicals were also found in the shed. A shipping container on the property contained sieves and vessels that appeared to have been used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine.

19The applicant's home was searched on 10 March 2010. An unregistered .22 bolt action rifle with scope and a pill press were seized. These are the subject of the s 166 matters. The applicant was arrested and remained in custody.

20At no time did police seize the product of the manufacturing process. The applicant's plea was entered on the basis that the quantity of methylamphetamine manufactured in the shed was not less than the commercial quantity, when account was taken of the three identified occasions when the manufacturing process was recorded. A quantity of 995 g was particularised in the indictment, being an estimate of the total amount of the drug manufactured over the relevant period.

Supply Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine

21In late January 2010 a series of intercepted telephone calls between the applicant, his cousin and Vince Monteleone recorded a discussion about the potential supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine to Monteleone whose intention was to on-sell the drug to a third party at a profit.

22On 9 February 2010, the applicant further discussed the price and the timing of the supply. Other discussions were recorded on 15 and 22 February 2010, the latter between the applicant's cousin and Monteleone. 

23During these calls, there was a reference to ""260"" which was taken as a reference to price. This figure forms the basis of the particular as to the quantity of the drug that was offered for supply.

Ground 1 : the Discount for the Plea of Guilty

24The applicant pleaded guilty to four counts of knowingly take part in the manufacture of a commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine in the Local Court at Goulburn on 22 November 2010. It appears from the transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court on that day that the Crown's representative withdrew two charges relating to the supply of methyl amphetamine. The applicant waived committal proceedings and was committed for sentence to the District Court. 

25On 10 January 2011 in the Local Court at Goulburn, the applicant's representative foreshadowed an application to reverse his pleas. The magistrate indicated that he considered himself functus and that the application would have to proceed in the District Court.

26The charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were no billed on 2 March 2011 and replaced with three ex officio charges. They were knowingly take part in the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine, knowingly take part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methyl amphetamine and possession of a pill press. 

27On 3 March 2011 in the District Court at Goulburn, the Crown's representative informed the court that the matters would be proceeding to trial. The applicant's representative indicated that the applicant had entered pleas of guilty on 22 November 2010 ""on the proviso that two additional sequences would be withdrawn"", those two charges apparently relating to the proposed supply. The applicant's representative further indicated that there would be an application for a permanent stay on the basis of an abuse of process and that the application would not be able to proceed for another three to four weeks. On that basis, the stay application was listed at Sydney District Court on 18 April with an estimate of half a day. 

28It is apparent that the stay application did not proceed. On 21 October 2011 the applicant entered pleas of guilty to the charges that ultimately proceeded to sentence. The matter came before Knox SC DCJ for sentence on 10 February and 9 March 2012. The applicant's representative pressed the application of a 25% discount and informed the judge in the course of an exchange that ""the Crown's position in relation to what charges they would lay changed a number of times in addition to which it was also put to us that all parties must plead otherwise the deals are off for the remainder."" That was a reference to the applicant's co-offenders.

29The Crown had earlier stated :-
It is true that pleas were entered in November. .. Albeit at that point with a different legal practitioner, but thereafter there was a dispute in relation to at least two - if I can go back to the committal in November, there were four charges. In February there was a dispute in relation to two of those and the point that I make in relation to that, is that my friend's submission is accurate to the extent that it reflects the offender's position in relation to two counts. The other two counts were, at that point in time, under challenge. .. In fairness to the offender, perhaps there is a discount applicable really to, if you like, half the matters from the very beginning, at the outset, and the Crown's position changed as a result of negotiation - I won't go into that - and I put in my submission that the overall position should date to March, that being the point where the matters which had come up from committal were no billed by the Director, that being on 3 March, and it was shortly thereafter that a concession was made by the offender in relation to all of them.

30During the judge's remarks on sentence, his Honour mistakenly referred to ""a withdrawal of those pleas"". I am of the view that this was a slip which did not reflect the true position. However, his Honour went on to say :-
There were ongoing and extensive negotiations over the facts, which are not entirely consistent with a full admission. Nevertheless it is a proper matter for both counsel and solicitors to be involved in those negotiations, which has clearly happened here to the benefit of their clients. ...........................
That has meant a significant demand on the DPP, the associated officer in charge and police officers who have clearly been involved in the ongoing negotiations. That is different from a situation where an offender at the first available opportunity admits fully to the matters and there are no other demands on the criminal justice system in all its respects.
While that history would normally mean a significant reduction in the sentence, I am alive to the reality of the litigation practices in this State, in this jurisdiction in particular, and especially also in the context of plea negotiations where other co-offenders are involved. Further, I think that there are good policy reasons why a substantial discount should be maintained when it avoids a trial where the nature of clandestine surveillance operations always run a risk, however minimal, of compromising the confidentiality of those operations.

31His Honour then referred to the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, dependent as they were upon the negotiations and the time which had elapsed to allow that to take place. His Honour then afforded a discount of 20% with respect to all charges against the applicant. 

32In R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 ; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] the relevant principles regarding the determination of a discount for a plea of guilty were encapsulated by Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing). In the course of that summary, it was noted that where there are multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea should be separately considered for each offence. It is fundamental to the decision in Borkowski that the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because the utilitarian value is reduced, even where there has been a plea bargain. 

33It follows that the judge was in error in failing to nominate a discount for the plea of guilty with respect to the manufacture offence separately from a discount for the plea of guilty to the supply offence. Disregarding the reasons for the late entry of the plea of guilty to the supply charge, the fact remains that the applicant pleaded guilty to the manufacture charge in November 2010, but did not plead guilty to the supply charge until October 2011, notwithstanding that the supply charge was in existence since March 2011.

34In those circumstances, the applicant was entitled to a discount of 25% with respect to the manufacture charge and a lesser discount with respect to the supply charge. I would not regard the discount of 20% with respect to the supply charge as inappropriate.

35The undiscounted sentence for the manufacture offence is 145 months (12 years and one month). Applying 25% to that sentence, a sentence of 109 months (9 years and one month) results. Applying the same ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence, the non-parole period is 5 years and 5 months. 

36Given that it will be necessary to re-sentence the applicant, the sentence for the supply offence should be corrected so that a non-parole period equal to the fixed term is imposed. 

37I turn to ground 2.

Ground 2 : Manifest Excess

38Possess an unregistered firearm contrary to s 36 of the Firearms Act 1966 carries a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment. However, since the judge was dealing with this offence pursuant to a s 166 certificate, the effective maximum penalty was 2 years' imprisonment.

39The applicant submitted to the judge that the unregistered .22 bolt action rifle with scope that was found at the applicant's home in Bringelly, which was a rural property, was kept for the eradication of vermin. The applicant effectively denied any connection between the firearm and the drug offences. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to this submission and noted that there was no evidence supporting it.

40The applicant relies upon Local Court sentencing statistics between January 2009 and December 2012. The applicant points out that of 399 cases, only 24 (6%) received a custodial sentence. However, one month is at the very bottom of that range of custodial penalties.

41The statistics do not establish that the sentence of imprisonment for one month is plainly unjust. Whatever the reason for the applicant's possession of the firearm, the gravamen of the offence resides in the fact that it was unregistered, thus facilitating the transfer to and use of the firearm within the criminal milieu. The applicant has not demonstrated that it was not within his Honour's sentencing discretion to impose a custodial penalty.

42There is no merit in ground 2. 

Re-Sentencing

43The re-sentencing exercise allows this Court to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. An aggregate sentence is the most appropriate way to reflect the increased discount for the plea of guilty to the manufacture offence in the overall sentence, as well as accommodating the imposition of the one month fixed terms.

44The sentence for the manufacture offence is as I have indicated at [35]. The sentence for the supply offence is a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 18 months.

45I propose the following orders :-

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Allow the appeal in part.

(3)Quash the sentences imposed by Knox SC DCJ and in lieu impose the following aggregate sentence :-

(i)A non-parole period of 6 years and one month is imposed to date from 10 March 2010, expiring 9 April 2016, with a balance of term of 3 years, expiring 9 April 2019. 

46The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 10 April 2016.

		10 February 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763051,Simon v R [2013] NSWCCA 328,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  In December 2010 the applicant stood trial in the District Court on 19 criminal charges, including 12 counts of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, they being threats by the accused to inflict actual bodily harm on the complainant by means of a knife.  The Crown case was that the applicant followed the complainant home from where she had been working in Darlinghurst, gained entry into her apartment without her knowledge and sexually assaulted her over a number of hours, before taking her credit card and leaving her tied up.  The accused pleaded not guilty to all counts, except Counts 18 and 19 which concerned use of the credit card.  His defence was that the sexual intercourse that occurred was consensual.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.
2On 10 March 2011 the trial judge imposed sentences in respect of each offence, amounting to a total sentence of 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 17 years.  
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal out of time against his convictions and his sentences.
THE EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL
The complainant's evidence
4In October 2009 the complainant was 22 years old and lived with her younger sister at a unit in Hurlstone Park.  She had a dancing qualification and in addition to doing dancing performances throughout Sydney for children, worked part-time in a cocktail bar in Oxford Street, Darlinghurst.  After finishing work in Oxford Street in the early hours of 31 October 2009, she spent time with friends because the trains were not then running.  At about 6.00 am she walked to Museum Railway Station and travelled by train to Hurlstone Park.  CCTV footage showed the applicant walking some distance behind the complainant as she entered Museum Railway Station, boarding the same train in a different carriage, alighting from the train at Hurlstone Park and walking behind the complainant as she headed on foot to her home.  
5The complainant's sister was getting ready for work when the complainant arrived.  She left between 7.00 and 7.30 am.  The complainant got into bed and went to sleep, having set her mobile phone alarm for midday.
6She awoke to find a man with a knife in his hand standing in her room.  He had some type of mask on.  He jumped on her, put his hand over her mouth and held the knife to her throat, saying ""Don't scream or I'll slit your throat"".  He moved the knife from her neck to just above her eye and told her twice that he would slit her throat if she screamed.  He kept repeating that.  
7Thereafter the applicant repeatedly sexually assaulted the complainant over a number of hours.  The assaults were accompanied by threats of violence to the complainant, causing her to be in a state of extreme terror.  In addition to penile/vaginal intercourse, the assaults included penile/oral penetration and attempts by the applicant to have anal intercourse.  
8At one stage the applicant said to the complainant:
""What am I going to do with you?  I can, I can slit your throat and burn your house down or I can tie you up and leave you"".
9At another time, he said:
""Do you know how long it takes to die after your throat's been slit? ... three minutes, two minutes and 50 - something seconds, it's different for everyone"".
10Before leaving, the applicant tied the complainant up with neck ties and orange tape and said:
""Don't call the police.  If you call the police, I'll kill your sister to get to you.  I'll kill your sister, I'll kill your mum, I'll kill your dad, I'll kill your brother"".
11After the applicant left, the complainant was able to free herself.  She ran to a neighbouring unit and called her mother and the police.  
The remainder of the Crown case
12The complainant's mother, neighbour and uncle gave evidence of complaints by the complainant consistent with her evidence.  The neighbour spoke of the complainant shaking profusely, with her teeth chattering on a glass of water.  Her uncle referred to her crying and trembling as he hugged her.  
13An ambulance officer gave evidence that she attended at the complainant's unit at about 2.10 pm on 31 October 2009 and the report of a doctor who examined the complainant at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on that day was tendered.  It revealed minor lacerations, bruising and swelling. 
14A number of police officers gave evidence of their inspections of the unit.  They did not identify signs of forced entry, although one of the bars on a window was observed to have come away from its frame and to be slightly protruding.  The complainant's sister gave evidence that when she went back to the unit her birth certificate and passport were missing from it.  She said that the state of disarray of the contents of the unit shown in photographs taken in the course of the police investigation on 31 October 2009 did not reflect their state when she left the unit that morning.  Evidence was also given of the use of the complainant's credit card at a nearby cash card machine at about 1.32 pm. 
15An agreed chronology recorded that the complainant made her call to police at 1.39 pm which was the time at which CCTV film showed the applicant entering Hurlstone Park railway station.  At 1.42 pm the applicant was filmed throwing some things onto the railway tracks.  He boarded a train at 1.56 pm.
16Evidence was given of the execution of a search warrant at the applicant's home at Daceyville.  Items found included a green jacket and a screwdriver.  
17Evidence was also given that the applicant's DNA was detected in a vaginal swab from the complainant and on orange tape that was allegedly used to bind the complainant.  It was also identified on a condom that was found on the railway tracks at Hurlstone Park Railway Station after an examination of the CCTV footage referred to above.  Also found there was a Nokia phone battery.  
The applicant's case
18The applicant gave evidence that on the morning of 31 October 2009 he did not follow the complainant to Museum Railway Station but went there for the purpose of catching a train to visit his mother at Campbelltown.  He said that he struck up a conversation with the complainant on the train and that she gave him cause to think that she was interested in him.  He alighted at Hurlstone Park Railway Station because he saw the complainant get off.  He said that he there had a further conversation with the complainant during which the complainant said that her sister would be going to work and ""if you're that keen, well, you'd wait"".  Later, after a young woman, who the applicant assumed to be the complainant's sister, left the unit block, the complainant came out onto the street and she and the applicant walked into the unit together.
19The applicant said that consensual sex then occurred and, after some time, he asked the complainant about having sex with her sister because he thought she was a virgin and he wanted to ""break her in"".  According to the applicant, this caused the complainant to become annoyed and require him to leave.  He said that he did so, taking a credit card and a piece of paper upon which the PIN for it was written.
20He agreed that CCTV footage showed him entering Hurlstone Park Railway Station at 1.39 pm.  He remembered hearing ambulance or police sirens but could not remember what he did at that point.  He agreed that the CCTV footage showed him throwing things down onto the railway tracks.  
21The applicant's mother gave evidence that she lived in Pagewood but was, at the time, working in Campbelltown.  She said that she had arranged to meet her son at Glenfield Railway Station on Saturday 31 October 2009. 
EXTENSIONS OF TIME - CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCE
22The applicant was convicted on 23 December 2010.  He filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal against conviction and sentence on 28 March 2011.  So far as his convictions were concerned, this was well outside the period of 28 days from his convictions allowed by s 10(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  The papers before the Court do not disclose the date upon which the Notice of Appeal concerning the convictions was lodged but this appears to have occurred in April 2013, long after the expiration of the period of six months for which a (duly filed) Notice of Intention to Appeal is to have effect pursuant to r 3A of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  If a Notice of Intention to Appeal is not filed within 28 days of the conviction a Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal must be filed within three months after the conviction or sentence (Criminal Appeal Rules r 3B(1)(b)).  This did not occur.  Section 10(1)(b) gives the Court power to extend the time for filing a Notice of Intention to Appeal and under r 3B(2), the Court may extend the time for the filing of a Notice of Appeal or Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.
23The specification of time limits for the pursuit of appeals is based upon the principle of finality, described by the plurality in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; 223 CLR 1 at [45] as ""a fundamental and pervading tenet of the judicial system"".  In considering whether an extension of time should be granted, it is not only the interests of the applicant for leave that must be considered.  Regard must be had to the interests of the Crown (representing the community) and to the administration of justice generally (Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [39]).  The longer the delay, the greater will be the justified expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over (ibid at [38]).  In considering whether to grant an extension, the Court has regard to the applicant's prospects of success on an appeal but should do so in a more summary fashion than if the applicant had brought an appeal or application for leave to appeal within time (Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262 at [24] - [25]; Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [35]; and see generally Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [22] - 33]).
24For the reasons given below, I consider that the applicant's proposed grounds of appeal lack merit, with the consequence that an appeal against his convictions would fail.  As it would therefore be futile to grant an extension of time, it should be refused.  I add that the solicitor's affidavit filed on behalf of the applicant does not in any event provide an adequate explanation for the delay.  Some steps were taken to obtain legal advice but there were long periods when nothing happened.
25The extension application in relation to the applicant's sentence is in a different position.  His Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed well within the 28 days after his sentence on 10 March 2011 allowed for its lodgement but his Application for Leave to Appeal against sentence was lodged about 2½ months outside the six month period allowed.  For the reasons given below, I have formed the view that the applicant's grounds of appeal against his sentences should be rejected.  However as his delay was limited and his intended Application for Leave to Appeal arguable, I consider that an appropriate extension should be granted.  
GROUNDS OF APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION
Ground 1:  The trial miscarried
26In support of this ground of appeal the applicant did no more than rely upon the matters relied upon in support of his other grounds.  It is not therefore an independent ground of appeal and should be rejected.
Ground 2: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the criminal standard of proof
27The applicant complained that in his Summing-Up the trial judge said, in referring to the standard of proof being beyond reasonable doubt, that those words required no explanation or elaboration by him and:
""Please note, members of the jury, as I said at the beginning, that the words are not 'beyond any doubt, they are simply 'beyond reasonable doubt'"".
28By this observation, the trial judge was not in my view attempting to explain the meaning of the expression ""reasonable doubt"" (compare Green v The Queen [1971] HCA 55; 126 CLR 28) but simply ensuring that the jury appreciated that the relevant test was in fact ""beyond reasonable doubt"".  The observation did not have the effect of diminishing the standard of proof (Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [49] - [51]) and was not objectionable.  
29In any event, no objection to the direction was taken at trial, with the result that the applicant is not entitled to rely upon this ground unless leave for him to do so is granted under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  As the ground lacks merit, I would refuse that leave.
Ground 3:  The trial judge improperly commented on the evidence and the legal result of the evidence
30This ground relates to the following passages in the trial judge's Summing-Up:
"" ... my own view, and here I am expressing my own views about facts, as I am entitled to do, my own view is that on a proper analysis of [the complainant's] evidence she gave evidence capable of supporting each and every one of the charges in the indictment beyond reasonable doubt ...
...
Although not a great deal of evidence in terms of number of words is necessary from [the complainant] necessarily to convince you beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven any given count in the indictment based upon her evidence, you must be satisfied that there is evidence, some evidence on which you can base a verdict of guilty, some evidence of each and every one of the elements"".
31As held in RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620 at [42], ""a trial judge may comment (and comment strongly) on factual issues"".  The trial judge's comments in the passages quoted were limited ones, conveying, in essence, a view that the complainant's evidence was capable of proving the Crown's case to the requisite standard.  There can have been no doubt that this view was correct.  Neither the applicant's trial nor appeal counsel suggested otherwise.  
32The issue for the jury at the trial was whether the complainant's evidence should be accepted.  The trial judge's Summing-Up made this abundantly clear.  As the applicant conceded that he was present at the complainant's home at the relevant time and that he engaged in repeated acts of sexual intercourse with her, the jury had to consider whether it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, as the complainant asserted, the conduct was not consensual.  The trial judge did not express a view to the jury on this question.
33The absence of objection by the applicant's trial counsel to the passages in the Summing-Up now complained of tends to confirm that they were not such as would have caused the jury to be under any misapprehension.  I would refuse to grant leave to the applicant under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground of appeal.  
Ground 5:  The trial judge erred in refusing an application to have the complainant recalled
34The complainant, who lived interstate at the time of the trial, gave evidence over three days concluding 15 December 2010.  On 16 December Detective Senior Constable Kendrew and two other police officers gave evidence.  DSC Kendrew deposed to her examination of the complainant's unit and her interview of her.  On the next day, 17 December 2010, the applicant's counsel sought to have the complainant recalled to enable counsel to put to her alleged inconsistencies between her evidence and her account of events to DSC Kendrew as recorded in DSC Kendrew's police notebook.  These comprised, at least principally, alleged omissions in what the complainant told DSC Kendrew.  The notebook had only been produced to the applicant the day before.  The Crown Prosecutor opposed the application, contending that there was no inconsistency.  
35The trial judge indicated to the applicant's counsel that his immediate reaction was ""why don't you just tender it?""  Counsel responded that she had thought about doing that but considered that the tender would be of limited value to her client because, in light of DSC Kendrew's evidence that she could not recall asking the complainant to give a complete account of the events, ""there was probably no expectation of it containing all the significant acts"".  After further discussion, the trial judge expressed the view that, if recalled, the complainant was likely to say ""I was upset, I can't remember exactly what I said"" and that he was ""singularly reluctant to bring [the complainant] back from another State for her to tell us that"".  The applicant's counsel had earlier agreed that it was likely that this was what the complainant would say.  His Honour also said that ""I think your client loses absolutely nothing, frankly that, in fact, he might gain something"".  The Crown Prosecutor added that he did not know whether the complainant had in fact yet returned home.
36On appeal the applicant relied on Hunt J's observation in R v Fleming (NSWCCA, 12 December 1989, unreported) that ""generally speaking"" a judge should ""always accede to a request to have a witness recalled for cross-examination upon a point of substance which has been overlooked - however incompetently - unless real and incurable prejudice is created for the party calling that witness"".  As there was no question of incompetence here, the applicant submitted that the observation applied a fortiori.  
37Notwithstanding Hunt J's observation as to what should generally occur, the trial judge had a discretion to accede to or reject the application.  In my view, it was reasonable for the judge to conclude that the applicant would not suffer any prejudice by refusal of the application as it was open to his counsel to tender the notebook and address the jury on the supposed inconsistencies.  That the applicant's counsel chose not to do this is not to the point.  An alternative course open to her would have been to obtain agreement from the prosecution as to what the notebook did or did not contain and to tender a note of agreed facts in the same way that an agreed chronology had been put before the jury.  Furthermore, there was in my view no error in the judge taking into account his reluctance to recall the complainant when she had completed a lengthy and arduous period in the witness box and had probably returned to her interstate home.
Ground 6:  The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to tender a metal grill
38The grill came from a window of the complainant's unit.  The Crown suggested in closing address that in light of damage to bars of the grill that it was possible that the applicant entered the unit through it.  The applicant's counsel spent considerable time in her closing address seeking to refute this as a possibility.  She had not however objected to the tender of the grill and no persuasive argument has been advanced on appeal as to why it was not properly admitted as an item of real evidence (see Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; 235 CLR 521 at [20] - [21]).  As there was no objection to the tender of the grill at the trial, the applicant requires leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground.  There is no good reason to grant such leave. 
Ground 7:  The trial judge erred in permitting inappropriate demonstrations in court and inviting demonstrations
39The applicant complained under this heading of the Crown Prosecutor's movement, in front of the jury, of a bar of the grill.  The applicant referred to s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 relating to orders for demonstrations, experiments and inspections, but that section does not apply to those steps when conducted inside the courtroom (Evans v The Queen at [30], [63], [195] and [266]).  
40As earlier noted, the metal grill was properly admitted into evidence.  I can see no reason why the applicant would have been prejudiced by what the Crown Prosecutor did, as the jury had the benefit of the applicant's counsel's immediate response as follows:
""I don't see how it assists the jury the Crown Prosecutor, weighing more and presumably being stronger than my client ever was, standing there bending the bars in front of them.  They will have the exhibit, they can give it a go for themselves"".
41What occurred did not therefore have the prejudicial character that was found in Evans v The Queen to exist in the judge's direction that the accused put on a balaclava, overalls and a pair of sunglasses.  
42The reference in this ground of appeal to the trial judge ""inviting demonstrations"" is to the trial judge's statement that the ""members of the jury can make their own examination"".  There was however nothing objectionable in this comment, particularly when the applicant's counsel had, moments earlier, said that the jury would have the exhibit and ""they can give it a go for themselves"".
43There is no substance in this ground of appeal.
Ground 8:  The trial judge erred in asking a question
44The applicant contends on appeal that the trial judge should not have asked a police officer who gave scientific evidence whether it was difficult for him to cut the bars of the window grill referred to earlier with his hacksaw.  The question was not objected to and in the context of the trial was innocuous. The highest the applicant puts his objection on appeal is that, first, the question and answer were meaningless without further information about the hacksaw and, secondly, the question and answer were likely to give a ""false picture"" because another police officer gave different evidence.  Neither point suggests that the applicant was unfairly prejudiced by the question.
45The applicant requires leave under r 4 to advance this ground.  There is no good ground for granting it. 
Ground 9:  The trial judge gave incorrect and misleading directions in respect to the issue of breaking and entry and its importance in the trial
46In his Summing-Up, the trial judge referred at two points to the applicant's allegedly unauthorised entry into the unit.  His Honour said, in effect, that if the jury was satisfied that the accused gained unauthorised entry to the unit, it did not need to find exactly how that happened.  During her final address at the trial, the applicant's counsel placed considerable emphasis on the absence of evidence of any damage to or tampering with any lock at the unit and advanced reasons why the jury should not conclude that the accused gained entry through the window grill that was tendered in evidence.
47The only complaint that the applicant's counsel made at the trial in relation to the Summing-Up on this topic was that the judge did not ask the jury to consider whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused would have been able to gain unauthorised entry without leaving evidence of that having occurred.  The judge declined to supplement his directions, saying in the absence of the jury:
""My point was simply this, you don't need to have done time at Long Bay, as an ordinary lay person, as a member of the jury, to know that it is possible to get into premises without necessarily leaving any discernible trace of it"".
48This was a commonsense approach which did not in my view involve any error.  The jury was well able to weigh the strength of the Crown's case and consider whether it had been proved beyond reasonable doubt, notwithstanding that no evidence of unauthorised entry was identified.  The applicant's counsel was effectively asking the judge to indicate to the jury that it could not find the Crown's case proved unless the Crown proved that unauthorised entry could have been gained without leaving evidence of it.  This would have been inaccurate as the jury was entitled to bring its commonsense and experience to bear on this, as on other issues.  
49The applicant did not take any other point at the trial relevant to this ground of appeal and has not in my view raised any issue on appeal that would warrant the granting of leave under r 4.  
Ground 10:  The conduct of the trial judge prevented the accused from having a fair hearing
Ground 12:  The trial judge was biased against the applicant
50I have reviewed the record of the trial as a whole and in particular those aspects of it to which attention is drawn in these grounds.  Ground 12 was formulated by the applicant and supported by written submissions prepared by the applicant himself.  Senior counsel for the applicant on the appeal made it clear that he was not advancing Ground 12.  As a result the applicant himself was given the opportunity to present oral submissions on it.  I have concluded that there is no merit in either ground.  As I am dealing with an application by the applicant to appeal long out of time, it is sufficient to make the following brief observations on the matters relied upon in relation to Ground 10.  No additional matters of significance were raised in relation to Ground 12.
51The first matter concerns the trial judge's observations in relation to the withdrawal of a former legal representative of the applicant.  In the course of the appeal hearing, the applicant conceded that these observations were not made in the presence of the jury.  Accordingly, the point has no substance.
52Secondly, the applicant complained of interruptions by the judge in the course of the applicant's evidence.  However, I do not consider these to have been excessive or inappropriate.  Essentially, they were for the purpose of ensuring that responsive answers were given, or for clarification.
53Thirdly, during the applicant's cross-examination, the Crown Prosecutor put a suggestion to him to which the applicant answered ""How do I answer that, sir?""  The judge then responded ""Truthfully would be an idea, Mr Simon"".  Although the element of sarcasm evidently embodied in this remark was inappropriate, I do not consider that it could reasonably be regarded as having caused the applicant any prejudice.  
54Fourthly, the applicant complained of an exchange during his cross-examination when there was confusion as to how long he had been at the unit.  In my view, nothing turned on this.
55Fifthly, the applicant complained that the judge asked him a misleading question as to what, if anything, the complainant could see during the course of an episode of oral sex.  Whether or not the judge's question was based upon a misunderstanding, the submission does not identify any unfair prejudice to the applicant.
56Sixthly, the applicant submits that the judge's attitude to him when he gave evidence was very different from the politeness with which he treated the complainant.  However I do not consider that there was any manifest difference which can fairly be regarded as having prejudiced the applicant.
57Finally, the applicant claims that in a number of respects the trial judge in his Summing-Up misstated the applicant's case or failed to mention important evidence.  None of these matters were the subject of complaint at the trial and none are of such significance as would warrant a grant of leave under r 4 to raise them.
Ground 11:  The verdict was unreasonable
58In considering this ground of appeal I have undertaken, as required by SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [14], an independent assessment of the evidence at the trial, both as to its sufficiency and quality.  In my view it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offences with which he was charged (ibid at [11]).  Further, I do not consider that it would be ""dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"" (at [14]).  My view is thus that the evidence supported the verdicts that were returned (BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48 at [31]).
59The following aspects of the evidence are of particular importance in this respect:
(1)The applicant's behaviour before the alleged offences occurred, as recorded on CCTV film, whilst he was on Oxford Street and at Museum and Hurlstone Park Railway Stations.  Taken together, the films give rise to the clear inference that the applicant followed the complainant at each of those places, keeping his distance so that she did not see him.
(2)The applicant's implausible explanation of why he travelled on a train to Hurlstone Park and implausible descriptions of his conversations with the complainant on the train, after alighting and near her unit. 
(3)The applicant's implausible explanation of why neck ties, which the complainant alleged were used to tie her up, were found knotted with yellow tape.  
(4)The applicant's implausible explanation of how he came to be in possession of the PIN number for the complainant's credit card.  The complainant said that the applicant extracted it from her under duress and that she had had no need to write down the number in order to remember it.  The applicant said that the PIN number was recorded on a note in the complainant's wallet, in which he found her credit card.
(5)The applicant's behaviour after the alleged offences, as recorded on CCTV, at the Hurlstone Park Railway Station at the time that he is likely to have heard police or ambulance sirens.  He appears to move out of sight and then dispose of items, by throwing them on the railway track.  The items were subsequently found to include a used condom with the applicant and complainant's DNA on it.
(6)The state of complete disarray of the unit as found on the police inspection was consistent with the complainant's evidence and was not satisfactorily explained by the applicant.  The complainant's sister confirmed that the unit had not been in that state when she left it on the morning of 31 October.
(7)The evidence of police officers, the complainant's neighbour, and her mother, sister and uncle of the complainant's state shortly after the period of sexual intercourse that the applicant asserted was consensual, strongly supported her evidence.  
(8)The evidence of those persons of complaints by the complainant shortly after the events in question.  Evidence of a complainant's distress and the content, recency and spontaneity of her complaints can provide strong support for a Crown case (Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [78] and [98]; Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232 at [200]).
(9)The evidence of the complainant herself which appeared from the transcript to be highly credible.  
60I have taken into account also the verdicts of guilty returned by what I regard as a properly instructed jury.  Having regard to all these matters, I am left in no doubt about the guilt of the applicant.  
61Three specific matters raised by the applicant in relation to this ground of appeal can be disposed of as follows.
62First, the applicant contended that it was significant that the complainant did not mention any episodes of penile/oral intercourse during the accounts she gave on 31 October 2009.  I do not consider that any significance is to be attached to this bearing in mind the extreme trauma which, on the complainant's evidence, she endured that day.  It is unsurprising that if she endured hours of sexual abuse at the hands of the applicant that she may not, in the hours following the assaults, have given an entirely accurate and comprehensive description of all that had occurred.
63Secondly, the applicant submitted that to the extent that the jury may have concluded that the applicant entered the unit through the window grill in evidence, the verdicts should be regarded as unreasonable.  I reject this submission as there is no reason to conclude that the verdicts were so based.  The Crown did no more than offer entry through the window grill as a possibility.  It made it clear that the jury did not need to find precisely how the applicant gained entry.
64Thirdly, the applicant submitted that there was no evidence to support the Crown's suggestion in address that, when at Hurlstone Park Railway Station after the time he spent at the complainant's unit, he was seen on the CCTV to move out of sight when a police car went by.  However in my view there was a firm basis for this suggestion when the CCTV film was considered in light of the evidence of the times of the complainant's 000 call and the applicant's use of her credit card, and the applicant's evidence of hearing a siren whilst on the station platform.
SENTENCE APPEAL
The sentences imposed
65As noted earlier, the trial judge imposed sentences totalling 22 years imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 17 years 6 months.  The following summary of the individual sentences imposed and the incompletely served sentences in respect of prior offences is taken from the applicant's written submissions:
""Count 1 (s. 113(2)) - break and enter with intent - a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment, commencing on 14 November 2011 and expiring on 13 November 2013.Counts 8 and 12 - s. 61L - indecent assaults - in respect of both counts - a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment, commencing on 14 November 2011 and expiring on 13 November 2013.Count 16 (s. 97(1)) - armed robbery - a fixed term of 1 year 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 14 November 2011 and expiring on 13 May 2013.Count 17 (s. 86(1)(b)) - detain for advantage - a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment, commencing on 14 November 2011 and expiring on 13 November 2013.Counts 18 and 19 (s. 178BA) - dishonestly obtain money by deception - in respect of both counts, a fixed term of 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 14 November 2011 and expiring on 13 May 2012.Counts 2, 3 and 4 (s. 61J(1)) - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - in respect of each count 18 years consisting of a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months, commencing on 14 November 2012 and expiring on 13 May 2026, with a parole period of 4 years 6 months, expiring on 13 November 2030.Counts 11 and 14 (ss. 61J(1)/344A) - attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - in respect of both counts 16 years, made up of a non-parole period of 12 years, commencing on 14 November 2012 and expiring on 13 November 2024, with a parole period of 4 years, expiring on 13 November 2028.Counts 5, 6 and 7 (s. 61J(1)) - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - in respect of each count 18 years made up of a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months, commencing on 14 November 2013 and expiring on 13 May 2027, with a parole period of 4 years 6 months, expiring on 13 November 2031.Counts 9 and 10 (s. 61J(1)) - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - in respect of both counts 18 years made up of a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months, commencing on 14 November 2014 and expiring on 13 May 2028, with a parole period of 4 years 6 months, expiring on 13 November 2032.  Counts 13 and 15 (s. 61J(1)) - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent - in respect of both counts 18 years made up of a non-parole period of 13 years 6 months, commencing on 14 November 2015 and expiring on 13 May 2029, with a parole period of 4 years 6 months, expiring on 13 November 2033.The non parole period of 210 months represented 79.6% of the total period of 264 months.As at 10 March 2011 (the date of sentence), the Applicant had been in custody since 10 November 2009 serving sentences in respect of several other unrelated offences.  On 10 March 2011, just shortly before Hosking DCJ delivered sentence, the Applicant appeared before Blanch J on a severity appeal in respect of one of those unrelated offences; Blanch J reduced the sentence imposed, so that the Applicant's release date for that offence was varied from 16 January 2012 to 13 November 2011.  Hosking DCJ set the sentences for the instant offences to commence on 14 November 2011.Including the sentences imposed in respect of all of the earlier unrelated offences, the Applicant's total effective sentence is one of 24 years 3 days, with a non-parole period of 19 years 6 months 3 days.  This is a ratio of non-parole period to total sentence of 81.25%"" (Amended Submissions on behalf of Applicant on Application for Leave to Appeal on Sentence pp 1 - 3).
66On 15 July 2011, the sentencing judge corrected the sentences under the slip rule by moving all dates for commencement and expiry back by two days.  The date for expiry of the aggregate non-parole period thus became 11 May 2029 and that for expiry of the aggregate head sentence became 11 November 2033.
The sentencing judgment
67After describing the conduct proved against the applicant, the sentencing judge noted from the complainant's Victim Impact Statement that, understandably, the offences had had a severe and lasting effect on her.  The Statement indicated that she suffered from depression and crippling panic attacks, and was no longer able to do her work as a dancer for children.  
68His Honour then turned to the applicant's criminal record which commenced with a number of offences as a juvenile.  As an adult, his criminal record began with a conviction for sexual intercourse without consent for which he was sentenced on 13 August 1992 to a total term of 21 months imprisonment.  The offence involved a violent assault, resulting in the victim screaming for help, breaking free and running down the street and the applicant grabbing her, pulling her into a shed and again violently assaulting her.  In the following years, the applicant had convictions for break, enter and steal, indecent assault, assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault with an act of indecency.  The last two charges involved a violent assault on a victim, pursuit of her after she escaped, and a further violent assault accompanied by a threat to kill her.  
69In 1995, the offender was convicted of stealing a motor vehicle, being in possession of housebreaking implements, goods in custody, assault, larceny and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  In 1996 he was convicted of stealing from a person and using a weapon to resist arrest.  For these offences he received a sentence of 6 years as a minimum term, with an additional term of 2 years.  Further offences of possess housebreaking implements, stealing a motor vehicle, larceny, malicious damage and escaping from lawful custody followed.
70In 2002 the applicant was convicted of take and drive a conveyance.  In 2004 he was convicted of robbery, obtaining money by deception, receiving stolen property, aggravated break, enter and steal and break, enter and steal.  In 2008 he was convicted of custody of a knife in a public place, of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and of contravening a domestic apprehended violence order.  According to his Honour, in April 2009 he was convicted of larceny and in October 2009 of break, enter and steal and causing malicious damage.  He committed a further break, enter and steal offence in 2010.  
71The judge noted that the applicant had not shown ""even a shred of remorse"" for his attacks on the present complainant and that whilst the judge was summing up to the jury at his trial, the applicant had made a gesture of contempt directed at the complainant.
72His Honour described the offences as involving ""horrific attacks against a young woman who was entitled to feel safe in her home.  They were not by any means sudden crimes of passion but were carefully planned by the offender"".  His Honour then described how the applicant had clandestinely followed the complainant onto a train and then to her home and, after gaining entry to her unit, had threatened to cut her throat.  He then stated that the applicant tormented the complainant over a period of hours ""in a variety of ways all the while sexually violating her, including [doing] his best to even have anal intercourse with her"".  
73His Honour continued:
""The offender has proven himself to my satisfaction, beyond any shadow of a doubt, to be and is a serious danger to society.  The offender has learned nothing from his many previous periods of imprisonment.  His criminal record shows that while he is at large he offends relentlessly, sexually assaulting women with violence, bashing people, robbing people, breaking into their homes, stealing their possessions, stealing cars and offending in numerous other ways.  The offender, in my assessment of him, has shown himself to be without a shadow of a doubt an antisocial purely selfish man who cares nothing for the personal integrity and rights of others, in fact that is too mild a description.  His long pattern of seriously criminal behaviour shows absolute contempt for both other people and for the criminal law in general.  When eventually released the offender will almost certainly offend again.  I rate his chances of rehabilitation at close to nil.  I recommend that when the offender is eventually released that, as a convicted serious sex offender, he be continuously monitored as closely as possible.  If possible the authorities should make the offender wear some kind of electronic tracking device twenty-four hours a day so that his movements can be monitored twenty-four hours a day.
It is clear from what I have said thus far that important factors in the offender's sentences are general deterrence, more particularly specific deterrence and protection of the community generally.
In terms of the various aggravated sexual assault counts I am obliged, because of the existence of the standard non-parole period, to assess where these offences stand in the overall scale of offences of this general kind.  In my view a mid-range offence might involve the use of a knife with threats of wounding and a considerable degree of trauma occasioned to the victim.  Here there were these following features as I have already noted:(1) Threats of death by the offender slitting [the complainant's] throat.(2) These assaults took place in her own home.(3) The entire episode involved considerable pre-meditation and planning.(4) In terms of injury and loss to [the complainant] herself, not only was she severely traumatised as might be expected but in addition she has effectively lost her own vocation"".
74The sentencing judge then noted the following concerning the applicant's subjective circumstances.
75The applicant grew up in Malabar, attending the local primary school and Matraville High School.  He told a reporting psychologist that he began smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol at the age of 12.  The psychologist's tests indicated that the applicant was well above average intelligence.  Another report that was in evidence indicated that the applicant began intravenous use of heroin at the age of 21, soon progressing to daily use.
76Having noted evidence that the applicant is an Aboriginal man who was born on 29 September 1972, the sentencing judge said:
""There is no adequate evidence before me that the offender had the kind of deprived background that was spoken of in the well known case of R v Fernando [Fernando v R (1992) 76 A Crim R 58].  It may have been, I will acknowledge, that his background at La Perouse and Matraville as a child was less than ideal but in my view there is no valid Fernando type factor that should operate here to reduce in any way the offender's sentences"".
77In concluding that the sentences for aggravated sexual intercourse should be 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 and a half years, the sentencing judge described the offences as ""well above the mid-range"" for the reasons he had already given.  He provided for accumulation as described in [98] below.
78After concluding that the applicant's total sentence should be 22 years with a 17 and a half year non-parole period, his Honour said:
""In my view the sentence in total that I have just indicated, even by comparison to a sentence for murder is appropriate for various reasons including these six reasons.  Firstly, I am dealing with multiple offences.  Secondly, I am dealing with a standard non-parole period and the offender's aggravated sexual assaults fall well above the mid-range and up towards the high range of objective seriousness.  Thirdly, there is the offender's appalling criminal record.  Fourthly, there is, as I have said, his complete absence of any remorse.  Fifthly, there is my assessment that if history is any guide the offender is highly likely to re-offend once released from custody.  And sixthly, my assessment is, as I have said, that he represents a very serious danger to the general community"".
79I turn now to the applicant's proposed grounds of appeal, dealing last with Grounds 1 and 2 which raise issues of manifest excess.  
Ground 3:  The sentencing judge erred in his determination of objective criminality
80The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred in concluding that the applicant's aggravated sexual assaults ""fall well above the mid-range and up towards the high range of objective seriousness"" (see [78] above).
81As assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence involves an evaluative judgment, it is reviewable only in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.  Thus, unless a particular error in approach can be identified, the question is whether the sentencing judge's assessment was open to him (R v Eckermann [2013] NSWCCA 188 at [28]).  In my view his Honour's assessment was not, to use the words of House v The King, ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (at 505) and it was thus well open to him, for the reasons that he gave (see [78] above).  Particularly significant to my mind was the prolonged period over which the assaults occurred and the fact that they occurred in the complainant's home and that the applicant's presence and repeated threats to kill were calculated to, and understandably did, induce extreme terror in her. 
82Particular submissions made by the applicant, and my responses, are as follows.
83First, the applicant submitted that, in assessing objective seriousness, the sentencing judge should not have taken into account the impact of the offences on the victim.  In support of this, he cited Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27] which relevantly states:
""The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders.  It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"".
84His Honour did not depart from this principle.  Consideration of the impact of the offences on the victim assisted in an assessment of the seriousness of what occurred.  It did not involve consideration of the applicant's subjective circumstances.
85Secondly, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge made errors of fact in describing the period of the offences as five to six hours and in saying that the applicant tormented the complainant.
86The precise period over which the offences were committed was not identified by the evidence.  The period would appear to have been a maximum of about six hours, as the complainant's sister left home between 7.00 and 7.30 am and the 000 emergency telephone call was made by the complainant at 1.39 pm.  However, based upon an estimate given by the complainant in evidence that she first saw the applicant ""maybe an hour and a half to 2 hours"" before her midday alarm went off, the period may have been closer to three hours.  His Honour's statement that ""over perhaps five or six hours the offender tormented [the complainant] in a variety of ways ... "" may thus have overstated the period, but the error was not material.  When the point was raised with his Honour after he had finished delivering his reasons, his Honour responded:
""My view is that whether it was 3 hours or 5 hours doesn't matter because the point is that it was over a number of hours and was equally terrifying whether it was 3 hours or 5 hours"".
87Furthermore, there was no error in his Honour describing the complainant as having been tormented over the relevant period.  A primary meaning of the word ""torment"" is ""to afflict with great bodily or mental suffering"" (Macquarie Dictionary, 5th ed (2009) Macquarie Dictionary Publishers Pty Ltd).  This is what the applicant did to the complainant. 
88Thirdly, the applicant submitted that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the following factors which should have led to an assessment of the offences as mid-range:  the degree of force or coercion used was limited; there were no humiliating threats or insults; there were no (gratuitous) acts of degradation of the complainant other than the sexual acts themselves; the complainant was not cut at any stage or subjected to undue pain and discomfort; except when tied up, the complainant did not suffer any physical injury; the applicant did not bring a knife to the premises, having obtained one there; at one stage the applicant stopped his assault when the complainant became particularly distressed; his attempted acts of anal intercourse were of very brief duration; each episode of sexual assault was not unduly lengthy and, finally, there was only one victim.
89None of these matters, whether taken individually or together, required an assessment of the offences as mid-range.  The complainant was undoubtedly degraded by the repeated sexual assaults which occurred in her own home and repeatedly threatened with violent death by having her throat cut with a knife which the applicant brandished.  The applicant's submissions amount to an attempt to have this Court re-assess the objective seriousness of the attacks, but the relevant question is whether his Honour's assessment has been shown not to be open to him.  This has not occurred.
Ground 4:  The sentencing judge erred in failing to distinguish between the objective criminality involved in Counts 3, 6 and 13 and that involved in the other aggravated sexual assaults
90The sentencing judge imposed the same sentence in respect of each count of aggravated sexual intercourse without distinguishing between those offences involving penile/vaginal intercourse and those involving fellatio (Counts 3 and 6) and digital penetration (Count 13).  The specification of the same maximum penalty for different types of sexual penetration does not mean that each type of penetration is to be treated equally seriously (Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 452).  Thus, the type of penetration involved is relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence (see for example R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [23] - [25]).  That however is but one consideration.  Also of importance are factors such as the place at which the offence occurs and whether it is accompanied by threats.  
91In my view, the present was a case in which the type of sexual penetration involved in the different offences assumed less importance than the other factors to which the sentencing judge referred in his assessment of objective seriousness.  Thus in my view it was, as the sentencing judge recognised, of prime importance in the assessment of objective seriousness in this case that the various forms of sexual assault occurred after the applicant's unauthorised entry into the complainant's home and were perpetrated over a lengthy period during which the applicant subjected the complainant to extreme terror by repeatedly threatening to cut her throat with a knife that he brandished.
92I do not consider that the applicant has demonstrated that the sentencing judge's assessment of objective seriousness was in error for the reason stated in this ground.
Ground 5:  The sentencing judge erred in his appreciation of the effect of the standard non-parole period
93The applicant did not refer to any part of the sentencing judge's reasons which he asserted reflected an error concerning the standard non-parole period.  As a result, he has not established that any error was made.
94To support this ground, it was not sufficient in this respect for the applicant to refer, as he did, to something said by the judge in the course of the sentencing submissions.  In any event, the remark to which he referred was not objectionable.  
95The applicant referred to the Crown's comment in argument, attributed to Howie J in AD v R [2005] NSWCCA 208, that ""parliament's introduction of a standard non-parole period of 10 years means that inevitably sentencing for offences such as this must increase"", to which his Honour replied ""that must be so"".  In fact Howie J said in that case (at [43]) that ""the effect of the standard non-parole period will generally be to increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies"".  Howie J's observation is not dissimilar to that which the High Court made in Muldrock at [31] that ""the likely outcome of adding the court's awareness of the standard non-parole period to the various considerations bearing on the determination of the appropriate sentence"" is an increase in sentences.  The sentencing judge did not err in expressing a view along these lines.
Ground 6:  The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the Applicant for the attempt offences
96The two attempt offences (Counts 11 and 14) were constituted by the applicant's unsuccessful attempts to have anal intercourse with the complainant.  In the course of his sentencing reasons, the judge erroneously referred to a standard non-parole period as being applicable to these offences.  However when this was raised with him after he completed the delivery of his reasons, he indicated that he was aware that no standard non-parole period was applicable and attributed the contrary reference in his reasons to a slip of the tongue.  The sentences his Honour imposed in respect of the attempt offences (16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years) were less than those in respect of the completed assaults.  
97Assuming that the sentences for the completed assaults were not manifestly excessive, a topic which I address below, I do not consider that any error as contended for in this ground of appeal has been established.  In particular, I do not consider that any inference favourable to the applicant's proposed appeal can be drawn from the fact that the difference in the sentences referred to was limited.  As with the sentences in relation to the acts of fellatio and digital penetration, the precise nature of the act in question in relation to the attempt offences was only one of many circumstances relevant to the assessment of their objective seriousness.  The context in which the attempt and other offences were committed justified their characterisation at not greatly dissimilar levels of criminality.  
Ground 7:  The sentencing judge erred in his application of the totality principle in respect of the accumulation of the individual sentences and accumulation on existing sentences
98For the purpose of considering issues of concurrence and accumulation, the sentencing judge grouped the offences into five categories.  The sentences for offences within each category were wholly concurrent with each other.  Each of the four categories after the first was accumulated to the extent of one year over the preceding category, with the effect that the total accumulation was four years.  The first category comprised the fixed term sentences in respect of Counts 1, 8, 12, 16, 17, 18 and 19.  The remaining four categories comprised the offences committed during the four separate episodes of sexual assaults that were committed.  
99The sentences that his Honour imposed on 10 March 2011 commenced on 12 November 2011.  Their commencement was deferred due to the applicant being in custody from at least 10 November 2009 serving sentences imposed in respect of offences unrelated to those concerning the present complainant.  The last of the non-parole periods in respect of those sentences was due to expire on 12 November 2011.  
100His Honour declined to allow for any concurrency of the present sentences with the last to expire of the applicant's pre-existing sentences (this being the only one still to expire).  He said that he could see no proper reason to do so.  
101The applicant complains, first, that the judge should not have accumulated the present sentences as he did because they formed 'a single episode of criminality'.  However, in my opinion it was within his Honour's discretion to take the view that whilst the sentence for one offence within one of his Honour's categories comprehended and reflected the criminality involved in the other offences within that category, the sentences for offences in different categories did not have that effect in relation to the criminality of the offences within other categories.  
102Decisions concerning concurrence and accumulation are discretionary decisions to which the principles in House v The King are applicable.  No error of principle having been identified, to succeed the applicant would have had to show that the judge's decision was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  In my view he did not do so.
103The same reasoning is applicable to his Honour's decision not to make the sentences to any extent concurrent with the pre-existing, unrelated sentences.  His Honour correctly took the latter sentences into account when considering the principle of totality, that is, that the aggregation of the sentences be ""a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved"" (Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 307 -308).  That his Honour did not refer in this context to all of the pre-existing sentences is not of consequence as it is apparent from his review of the applicant's criminal history that he was well aware of those earlier sentences.
Ground 8:  The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the offender and his prior criminal record
104The applicant complains first of a comment made by the sentencing judge immediately after the applicant was convicted that ""this will be the last time your client rapes anybody"", his acceptance in the course of the sentencing submissions of the Crown proposition that the applicant was ""a recidivist violent sex and property offender"" and his comment in his sentencing judgment that the applicant's ""criminal record shows that while he is at large he offends relentlessly - sexually assaulting women with violence, bashing people, robbing people etc.""  The first of these comments was unnecessary and inappropriately emotive but is not indicative of error in his Honour's subsequent sentencing decision.  The second and third were justified by the applicant's criminal record.
105Contrary to the applicant's submissions, the judge's further comment in his sentencing reasons that the applicant thought he had skill as a criminal was justified by the steps that the applicant took, whilst with the complainant at her home, to attempt to conceal his identity from the complainant and prevent it subsequently being ascertained.  
106Again contrary to the applicant's submission, there was no error in the sentencing judge's remark to the effect that the applicant had been treated with considerable leniency when sentenced in the past.  
107The sentencing decision here pre-dated the High Court decisions in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 and Munda v The Queen [2013] HCA 38; 87 ALJR 1035.  However his Honour considered whether the applicant, who is an Aboriginal man, had a deprived background and concluded that he had not.  The evidence did not suggest otherwise.
108The applicant further complains that the sentencing judge declined to grant an adjournment to enable preparation of psychiatric or psychological reports.  However, it was within his Honour's discretion to do this as the Crown asserted, without contradiction by counsel for the applicant, that the Crown had subpoenaed the Justice Health file for the applicant and this showed that in none of the psychiatric and psychological reports tendered in his many past sentencing proceedings had he presented with any mental health problems.  
Ground 9:  The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence had been aggravated by the offender's conduct in court
109The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge increased the applicant's sentences as a result of the applicant's gesture of continuing contempt towards the complainant made during the Summing-Up.  However, his Honour did not do that.  He simply treated the conduct as demonstrating a complete absence of remorse, that being a factor which, if present, would have justified mitigation of the penalty.  His Honour did not err in doing this.
Ground 10:  The sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances 
110The total effective non-parole period represented 79.6% of the aggregate sentence.  The prima facie requirement imposed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the balance of the term of a sentence not to exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence only applies to individual sentences and not to the aggregate effect of a number of sentences.  However, a departure from that proportion in respect of the aggregate sentence is a basis for a finding of special circumstances.  If a sentencing judge is not to find special circumstances in that situation, ""one would expect the sentencing judge to articulate his or her reasons for doing so and, in the absence of such reasons, the inference might be drawn that the practical effect of the accumulation was overlooked""(Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 at [29]).
111Here the sentencing judge did not mention the issue in his sentencing reasons.  When the Crown raised it at the conclusion of the delivery of those reasons, the judge adhered to the sentences that he had imposed but did not give any reason for not finding special circumstances, although he did say that ""it is often impossible to comply with that ratio"".
112His Honour did not therefore articulate any good reason not to find special circumstances and to reduce the aggregate non-parole period to 75% of the aggregate sentence.  I consider that such a reduction was appropriate and that his Honour was in error in not making it.  The appropriate reduction to the aggregate non-parole period can be achieved by finding special circumstances because of the accumulation of sentences and thereby changing the non-parole periods and parole periods for Counts 13 and 15 to 12 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months respectively.  This results in an aggregate non-parole period of 16 years 6 months which is 75% of the aggregate head sentence.
Ground 1:  The sentences imposed in respect of counts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 were manifestly excessive
Ground 2:  The total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive
113Sentencing decisions are discretionary judgments to which the principles in House v The King are applicable.  Thus, ""a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion"" (Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]).  If no specific error can be demonstrated, an appellant cannot succeed unless he or she establishes that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust, such that it can be concluded that some, albeit unidentified, error must have occurred (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).  This ground, referred to as one of manifest excess, is established where the sentence imposed ""is out of the range of sentences that could have been imposed and therefore there must have been error, even though it is impossible to identify it (Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [60]; Bugmy v The Queen at [52]).
114Departure from a range of sentences imposed in previous cases does not indicate that a sentence is manifestly excessive.  ""[P]revious sentences may be used to establish a range of sentences that have been imposed but not that the range is correct.  In particular, the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'"" (Munda v Western Australia at [39] citing Hili v The Queen at [54]).
115The applicant referred to New South Wales Judicial Commission statistics in relation to sentences for s 61J offences as the foundation for his submission that he was ""sentenced on the basis that his offences were far worse than other offences despite no finding having been made that they were so and the judge having found, at worst, that they [were] above the mid-range"".  
116Bearing in mind the diversity of the conduct that can constitute an offence under s 61J, I do not consider statistics to be of assistance in the present case.  To adapt an observation made by the plurality in Hili v The Queen at [48] in the context of federal offences, the limited number of offenders sentenced each year and the diversity of the circumstances of their offending and their personal circumstances render it ""not possible to make any useful statistical analysis or graphical depiction of the result"".  
117If any guidance is to be gained in relation to the resolution of the present ground of appeal from sentences previously imposed, it must come, if at all, from consideration of the features of particular cases decided in the recent past.  I say recent because, as observed in R v Magnuson [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [117], ""[o]ver the past 25 years, there have been a number of developments within the criminal justice system of New South Wales that have led to a lengthening of sentences to be served, both with regard to sexual offences and offences generally"" (per Button J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed).
118It is unnecessary to repeat the reviews undertaken in R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 at [48] - [52] and Stephens v R [2010] NSWCCA 93 at [60] - [64] of earlier, potentially relevant, sentencing decisions.  It is sufficient to refer to the decisions in R v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218 and in Stephens itself.
119The decisions reviewed in Skaf and Stephens were relied upon by the applicant in the present case to support the following submissions:
""Unlike Boatswain, Presta and AEM, there was only one victim; unlike Boatswain, Presta and Roberts, the applicant did not humiliate the victim by urinating on her; unlike AEM, the offences were not committed in company (although this is now a separate offence, attracting a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - s.61JA); unlike Presta, Reyes and CM implements were not inserted into the victim's body and she was not subjected to significant corporal violence; and unlike Reyes, the applicant did not inject the victim with an illicit drug; Eatts of course involved a prison assault - an area where the Courts have traditionally imposed heavier sentences because of the vulnerability of prisoners in gaol.
With respect to the attempt offences it is respectfully submitted that they could not appropriately be described as in any way more than serious"".
120In Reyes, the complainant was detained, at knife point and against her will, for a period of about 20 hours during which the offender sexually assaulted her repeatedly and injected her with amphetamines.  Following a successful Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence imposed in the District Court, this Court imposed total sentences of 18 years imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 15 years.  Grove J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed) described the offences as falling ""at least in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" (at [84]).  The offender had a prior criminal record but it did not include any offences of violence or sexual assault.
121In Stephens, the offender detained the complainant in her car for a period of time during which he sexually assaulted her in a variety of ways.  He was sentenced in the District Court to an effective term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years, after a discount of 25 per cent for pleas of guilty and partial accumulation.  Fullerton J (with whom Latham and Schmidt JJ agreed) described the offences as ""serious and easily characterised as offending in the mid-range"", although not within the worst case category (at [65]).  After identifying some specific errors in the sentencing process, the Court re-sentenced the offender to sentences totalling 18 years imprisonment, with an aggregate non-parole period of 12 years.  It did so after taking into account a 25% discount for early pleas of guilty and notwithstanding that the offender had no prior criminal record.
122It is true that the applicant here has been able to point to cases in which it is arguable that more lenient sentences than the present were imposed but that is of limited, if any, significance, because that will almost always be able to be done (see Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 77 at [45] - [46]).  What is of more, although still limited, significance is that there are cases (Reyes and Stephens) in which sentences not wholly disproportionate to the present sentences have been imposed.  Moreover the sentences imposed in those cases were, because they resulted from this Court re-sentencing, ones regarded by this Court as the appropriate sentences for the offences.  They were not simply sentences imposed by a lower court that this Court allowed to stand because it had not been shown that they were manifestly excessive.  It may be inferred therefore that the sentences which this Court would have considered able to be imposed by a lower court without being quashed on appeal for manifest excess would have included ones higher than the sentences imposed by this Court.
123It is true also that one can, as the applicant has done (see [119] above), point to aggravating features that were present in other cases but not in this.  That does not however mean that the present case, with its own aggravating features, in particular the subjection of the complainant to extreme terror over a period of hours in her own home, does not warrant the sentencing judge's description of the offences as ""up towards the high range of objective seriousness"".  As I have held above, there was no error in his Honour so describing the offences.  
124In sentencing the applicant his Honour rightly had regard also to the multiplicity of offences, the applicant's ""appalling criminal record"", his absence of remorse, the high likelihood that he will re-offend and the ""very serious danger to the general community"" that he represents (see [78] above).  Taking into account these factors, the maximum sentences stipulated (in particular that of 20 years for the s 61J offences) and the standard non-parole periods where applicable (in particular that of 10 years for the s 61J offences), I cannot, and do not, conclude that the sentences imposed in the District Court were manifestly excessive in the sense to which I have referred above.  I would accordingly reject these grounds of appeal.
ORDERS
125For the reasons above, I propose the following orders:
(1)Application for extension of time to appeal against conviction refused.
(2)Application for extension of time to appeal against sentence granted.
(3)Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted.
(4)Appeal against sentence allowed in part.
(5)In relation to the sentences imposed in the District Court on 10 March 2011 (and corrected on 15 July 2011):
(a)Quash the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 13 and 15 and in lieu impose sentences comprising a non-parole period of 12 years 6 months to commence 12 November 2015 and expire 11 May 2028 and a balance of the term of the sentence of 5 years 6 months to expire 11 May 2033.
(b)The sentences imposed are otherwise confirmed.
(c)Accordingly, the applicant's sentences will expire on 11 November 2033, with the earliest date that he will be eligible for parole being 11 May 2028.
(6)Appeal against sentence otherwise dismissed.
126LATHAM J:  I agree with the orders proposed for the reasons given by Macfarlan JA.  Having reviewed all of the evidence adduced at trial, I also have no doubt that the applicant was rightly convicted on all counts.
127Counsel at trial was confronted with a particularly challenging task.  Faced with the irrefutable evidence establishing that the applicant had indeed had sexual intercourse with the complainant, the applicant's case necessarily focussed on the complainant's consent to a series of sexual acts with a virtual stranger whom she encountered on public transport in the early hours of the morning.  As Macfarlan JA has noted at [59], there was a powerful body of evidence which rendered that account inherently ludicrous.
128Notwithstanding this considerable forensic difficulty, counsel at trial conducted a vigorous and legitimate defence case.  There was nothing more that could have been done, consistent with trial counsel's duty to the applicant and to the court, in all of the circumstances of the trial.
129The appeal against conviction bears all the hallmarks of a trawl through the trial transcript, isolating evidence and directions from their context, in order to justify a challenge to these inevitable and entirely appropriate verdicts.
130R A HULME J:  I agree with the reasons, conclusions and orders proposed by Macfarlan JA.  
131I also agree with the additional observations of Latham J.  My own assessment of the evidence leads me to the same conclusion that the verdicts of the jury were inevitable and entirely appropriate

2763052,Dang v R & Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 326,"Judgment

1Macfarlan JA: I agree with Hidden J.

2Hidden J: The applicants, Martin Lam Dang and Bernard Thomas Matthews, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of ecstasy, in which they were jointly involved. That offence carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. Each of them asked the sentencing judge to take into account when sentencing for that offence a number of offences on a Form 1. There was an offence of supplying an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, and a number of offences of supplying small quantities of prohibited drugs. There were more offences on the Form 1 of Mr Matthews than there were on Mr Dang's, a matter to which I shall refer later.

3In addition, Mr Matthews pleaded guilty to selling firearms on an ongoing basis, an offence under s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act 1996, carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. He also asked the judge to take into account, when sentencing for that offence, two offences of unlicensed possession of ammunition, an offence of selling ammunition without seeing the buyer's licence, and the unauthorised selling of a firearm part.

4For the offence of supplying ecstasy, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, Mr Dang was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 ½ years, comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and 8 months and a balance of term of 3 years and 10 months, commencing on the date of his arrest, 23 April 2008.

5For the offence of selling firearms on an ongoing basis, taking into account the Form 1 matters related to that offence, Mr Matthews was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 7 years and 3 months, dating from the day of his arrest, also 23 April 2008. For the offence of supplying ecstasy, taking into account the Form 1 matters related to it, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years and 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 5 years, commencing on 23 July 2011. Thus the sentence on the drug offence was accumulated upon the sentence for the firearms offence by 3 years and 3 months, producing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with an effective non-parole period of 11 years. 

6Both applicants were dealt with by Charteris DCJ, who in both cases discounted sentence by 10% in recognition of late pleas of guilty. Both men seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. Each of them complains of manifest excess, but otherwise their applications are on different grounds. 

Facts

Supplying Ecstasy - both applicants

7The applicants were involved in the supply of ecstasy to undercover police officers on two occasions. On 28 March 2008, 237.6 grams of the drug, with a purity of 23.5%, was sold for $14,000 to an undercover officer known as Alex. On 15 April 2008, 494.8 grams, with a purity of 30%, was sold for $29,000 to an undercover officer known as Sean. The offence to which the applicants pleaded guilty embraced these two transactions, involving a combined weight of 732.4 grams. The large commercial quantity for ecstasy is 500 grams.

8The drugs were sourced from one Aaron Hsu, with whom Mr Dang had contact. On each occasion Mr Dang made arrangements for Mr Hsu to provide the drugs to Mr Matthews in the area where the sale was to take place. It was Mr Matthews who supplied the drug to the undercover officers and who received the purchase price. In each case the money was handed over to Mr Hsu less $1,000, which was to be shared by the applicants as recompense for their part in the venture. 

9The most serious offence on the Form 1 for each applicant was the supply of an indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, also to Alex. That offence was arranged by Mr Dang in collaboration with Mr Matthews and, again, it was Mr Matthews who supplied the drug to Alex for $21,000. The drug was in two bags, one weighing 27.3 grams of a purity of 61.5%, and the other weighing 27.9 grams of a purity of 63%. The total weight was 55.2 grams. Otherwise, the offences of supplying small quantities of prohibited drugs on each Form 1 related to the provision of samples for the purpose of negotiating the sales of the drugs. 

10At the time the applicants were sentenced Mr Hsu had been dealt with by another judge. To that matter also I shall refer later. 

Ongoing sale of firearms - Matthews

11Mr Matthews' offence of selling firearms on an ongoing basis arises from his sale to Alex on four occasions of firearms which Alex was not authorised to possess. On 15 January 2008, he sold him a .32 self-loading pistol for $2,000. With it were 16 bullets. The weapon was later found to be functional but not in perfect working order.

12On 11 February 2008, he sold Alex two similar firearms, being .22 Winchester magnum bolt-action repeating rifles, for $650. Neither rifle had a magazine. Testing of those weapons found them to be in working order. 
On 23 April 2008, he sold Alex yet another .22 Winchester repeating rifle for $550. It also was in working order.

13Of the Form 1 matters associated with this offence, the offence of selling ammunition without seeing the buyer's licence arose from his supplying the ammunition with the .32 automatic pistol. Offences of possessing ammunition without authority and the unauthorised selling of a firearm part arose from his supplying Alex on 12 February 2008 with .22 ammunition and a magazine for one of the rifles he had sold him the previous day. The remaining offence of possessing ammunition was the result of the finding of further .22 ammunition during a search of his home on the day of his arrest.

Subjective cases

Dang

14Mr Dang was thirty-one years old at the time of the offences, and is now 37. He has a relatively short criminal history, the more serious offences having been committed when he was a juvenile. That included a number of offences of armed robbery, apparently committed on the same occasion, for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the District Court. He had no previous drug offences. There was a volume of material before Judge Charteris about his background, which was not an easy one and included abuse of alcohol and illicit drugs. For present purposes, however, it is not necessary to examine this material. 

Matthews

15Mr Matthews was aged between 59 and 60 at the time of the offences, and is now 64. He has a formidable criminal history in this State, although it is old. It spans the period between 1963 and 1983. It includes offences of armed robbery, for which he was sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment. There are also entries for the unauthorised possession of firearms. He served terms of imprisonment during the dark period of this State's penal history before the Nagle Royal Commission in the 1970s, including incarceration in the then notorious Grafton Gaol and the high security unit, Katingal.

16Thereafter he did not come under adverse notice for many years. However, in 1997 he was sentenced in Brisbane to another substantial term of imprisonment for stealing with actual violence whist armed with a dangerous weapon and related charges. He was released on parole in respect of that sentence in 2000, returned to New South Wales in 2002, and completed that period of parole without incident in 2006. Apart for a minor entry for possession of indian hemp in 1983, he also has no history of drug offences. 

17In his case also there is no need to recite his background in any detail. He had a disturbed upbringing. He has for some years suffered from diabetes and a serious heart condition. A psychologist, who saw him for the purpose of these proceedings but had also had contact with him during his imprisonment between 1978 and 1981, diagnosed him as suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his experience of prison in those years.

The applications

18As I have said, both applicants complain that the sentences passed upon them are manifestly excessive. Before turning to that matter, I shall examine the other grounds upon which each of them relies.

Dang - parity

19It is asserted on Mr Dang's behalf that the relativity of the sentence passed upon him with those passed upon Mr Matthews and Mr Hsu for the same offence leaves him with a justifiable sense of grievance.

20Mr Hsu was sentenced by Toner DCJ. He had pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying ecstasy and a charge of unauthorised possession of a .45 pistol. In his case also there were Form 1 matters. Judge Toner discounted the sentence for the drug charge by 10% for a late plea of guilty, but allowed a 25% discount for an early plea to the firearm charge. On the drug charge he was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 ½ years with a non-parole period of 10 years, and on the firearm charge he was sentenced to a partly cumulative term of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. The aggregate sentence was imprisonment for 14 years with an effective non-parole period of 10 ½ years.

21Mr Hsu's appeal against those sentences was unsuccessful: Hsu v R [2012] NSWCCA 248. The leading judgment was delivered by Fullerton J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Campbell J agreed.

22As Fullerton J recorded at [21], Judge Toner characterised Mr Hsu as a ""facilitator"" or a ""commission agent"", being ""someone who sources the drugs on behalf of a purchaser and accounts back to the person from whom they were sourced."" When dealing with the applicants, Judge Charteris had regard to the sentence passed upon Mr Hsu. He considered him to be ""further up the supply chain."" He also noted a number of drug offences in his criminal history, including a conviction for supplying a prohibited drug for which he had been sentenced to imprisonment. Mr Hsu's record was summarised by Fullerton J at [19]. Her Honour also noted that Judge Toner was unable to find that he had good prospects of rehabilitation: [26].

23Judge Charteris considered the criminality of the applicants to be less than that of Mr Hsu, but the same as between themselves. He found that they were motivated by the hope of financial gain, although he accepted that their rewards were ""paltry in the extreme."" Nevertheless, he concluded that they had intended to maintain a relationship with the undercover officers and that there would have been ""potential for ongoing supplies and profits,"" even though they might have been ""very small."" On the other hand, his Honour described Mr Matthews' criminal record as ""far worse"" than Mr Dang's. 

24Counsel for Mr Dang in this court, Mr Dhanji SC, submitted that Mr Hsu's role in the offence was significantly more serious than Mr Dang's. He also noted Mr Hsu's history of drug offences and Judge Toner's unfavourable finding as to his prospects of rehabilitation. In addition, he observed that he had the benefit of a substantially concurrent sentence for the firearm offence. 

25That concurrency of sentence was, of course, well within the proper exercise of Judge Toner's discretion. The focus must be upon the sentence passed on Mr Hsu for the drug offence. It exceeded Mr Dang's sentence by 1 year as to the head sentence and `1 year and 4 months as to the non-parole period. As I have said, Judge Charteris considered Mr Hsu to be further up the chain of supply but clearly, in the light of Judge Toner's finding, he was not at the end of it. Judge Charteris said of Mr Dang that he was ""shown to have had contacts further up the supply chain; he was able to contact Mr Hsu who had contacts that could actually provide the drugs."" In my view, a comparison of the sentence passed upon Hsu and those passed upon the applicants demonstrates a recognition of the distinction between their roles and their subjective cases which was reasonably open to Judge Charteris.

26As to the sentences passed upon the applicants themselves, it will be remembered that for the drug supply charge Mr Dang was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 ½ years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 8 months, and Mr Matthews to imprisonment for 12 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months. Accordingly, Mr Matthews' head sentence was only 3 months longer than that of Mr Dang, and his non-parole period was almost a year less. 

27Mr Dhanji submitted that a comparison of the two sentences demonstrated a failure to recognise the difference in the criminality of the two men and in their subjective cases. While accepting the basal findings of fact of Judge Charteris, Mr Dhanji argued that Mr Matthews' criminality should have been assessed as greater than that of Mr Dang. It was Mr Matthews who had courted the undercover police officers and instigated the supplies in which Mr Dang became involved. Moreover, he noted that it was Mr Matthews who handled the drugs and the money.

28While accepting these factual observations, it does not appear to me that they have a significant bearing upon the level of criminality of the applicants. In Mr Matthews' case there was an agreed statement of facts. However, In Mr Dang's case there was not. The facts had to be gleaned from evidence that had been given during a trial which had proceeded for four days before he entered his plea of guilty. In sentencing Mr Dang, his Honour arrived at his findings of fact after a careful examination of the evidence. His assessment of the criminality of the two men was well open to him. 

29Mr Dhanji noted that on Mr Matthews' Form 1 was an offence, in which Mr Dang was not involved, of supplying 302.9 grams of pills held out to be a prohibited drug but which proved, in fact, to contain only caffeine. Judge Charteris had characterised that offence, together with the supply of the indictable quantity of methylamphetamine, as the most serious matters on that Form. Further, Mr Matthews' criminal record was undoubtedly much more serious than that of Mr Dang. On the other hand, the Form 1 matter involving the pills was not of any great significance in the overall picture. Most of Mr Matthews' criminal record was old and there had been significant periods of his life when he had apparently avoided conflict with the law. Moreover, as the Crown prosecutor in this court pointed out, in sentencing him Judge Charteris took into account the state of his health, both physical and mental. I shall refer to this material when dealing with Mr Matthews' application.

30The sentence passed on Mr Matthews for the drug offence, and more particularly the non-parole period, have to be understood in the light of the fact that they were part of a structure of sentencing encompassing the firearms offence. In determining those sentences his Honour expressly had regard to the principle of totality. Having determined that he was entitled to a finding of special circumstances, his Honour arrived at the aggregate sentence to which I have referred: imprisonment for 16 years with an effective non-parole period of 11 years. In my view, his Honour approach demonstrated no discretionary error and does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of Mr Dang.

31The principles of parity of sentence are well established and are the subject of a long line of authority, to which I need not refer. It is appropriate, however, to refer to a passage in a decision of this court to which the Crown prosecutor referred. In Gurney and Willetts v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 48, Whealy JA, with whom Johnson J and I agreed, observed at [82]:

""... where the same judge comes to sentence two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences, taking into account the differing criminality of each, and the differing circumstances, an appellate court will be cautious and not overly willing to conclude that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance, simply because there are different sentencing outcomes (R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47, per Barr and Howie JJ at [71]).""

32Of course, these observations are apt whether the complaint be of unwarranted disparity of sentence between two offenders or of insufficient distinction in sentence between them. As it happens, the applicants were sentenced on consecutive days: Dang first, followed by Matthews. However, both sentences were reserved decisions following a sentence hearing which extended over several days. The fact that the sentences were not passed simultaneously makes no difference to the force of the observations of Whealy JA. 

33I would reject this ground.

Matthews

34It is agreed that the first ground of Mr Matthews' application must succeed. As I have said, in respect of the charge of selling firearms on an ongoing basis Judge Charteris passed a fixed term of imprisonment. As the offence carries a standard non-parole period, it was not open to his Honour to do so. A court must set a non-parole period in respect of an offence for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed: s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

35Reference was made to Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77, in which I had occasion to consider the approach of this court to intervention when a ground such as this is made out: [13] - [19]. In the present case counsel were agreed that his Honour regarded the fixed term as equivalent to a head sentence. Accordingly, a non-parole period should be fixed in respect of it. I shall return to the question of re-sentence on this count after considering the other grounds of the application. 

36The second ground asserts that his Honour fell into error in sentencing for the firearms offence on the basis that it was aggravated. The offence of selling firearms on an ongoing basis is to be found in s 51B(1) of the Firearms Act, which relevantly provides that a person must not sell a firearm in breach of s 51(1) of the Act ""on 3 or more separate occasions over any consecutive period of 12 months."" In his remarks on sentence his Honour, after noting that three sales would be sufficient to constitute the offence, added that it ""must be an aggravating factor that four sales took place."" 

37Counsel for Mr Matthews in this court, Mr Ramage QC, argued that his Honour fell into error by effectively treating that matter as an aggravating feature when it was an element of the offence charged. He referred to established authority that a matter should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act if it is an element of the offence for which the offender is being sentenced: Mansour v R [2011] NSWCCA 28, 209 A Crim R 275, per Price J at [46]. As s 51B(1) creates an offence of selling firearms on ""3 or more separate occasions"" over the relevant period, he argued, the fact that four weapons were sold falls within the description of the offence and should not be treated as an aggravating factor.

38It is, perhaps, unfortunate that his Honour used the expression ""aggravating factor"", which has become something of a term of art because of s 21A. However, there is force in the Crown prosecutor's submission that his Honour meant no more than that an offence of this kind involving four firearms is necessarily more serious than one involving three. Obviously, that must be so. 

39Mr Ramage also relied on the passage of his Honour's remarks which followed the one I have quoted above: 

""I realise that some of the weapons were not functional or completely functional but they could discharge bullets. A revolver, or rifles when cut down, when falling into the wrong hands can cause a lot of trouble in our community. This court and other courts are well experienced with what is occurring in our community with the use of pistols and of cut down and prohibited weapons.""

40Mr Ramage argued these observations also amount to erroneous findings of aggravating factors. He noted that none of the rifles Mr Matthews supplied were cut down. He also noted that, while the rifles were described in the indictment as prohibited firearms, they did not strictly fall within the definition of that expression in Schedule 1 to the Firearms Act.

41Again, this amounts to examining his Honour's observations with a technicality which is unwarranted. It is clear enough that his Honour was commenting upon the hazards arising from the availability of unauthorised firearms in the community generally, so as to emphasise the seriousness of any offence of unlawful dissemination of firearms.

42This ground is not made out.

43Ground three is that his Honour failed to give adequate weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances and ground five complains about his characterisation of the gravity of the drug offence. These are really particulars of the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive, and can be dealt with briefly.

44Mr Ramage submitted that his Honour failed to afford appropriate weight to the applicant's age and the state of his health. However, his Honour expressly took both those matters into account. In his remarks he said:

""I also consider his age and health are matters that I will take into account but I caution myself in accepting that Mr Matthews decided to go down the path of serious criminal behaviour."" 

45Mr Matthews' health was an important matter on sentence. There was a volume of material about it before his Honour, including reports of Dr Ford, a cardiologist, and Dr Greenaway, an endocrinologist, together with the report of the psychologist to whom I have referred, Mr Watson-Munro. His Honour addressed the salient features of those reports in his remarks, affirming that he had taken each of them into account. 

46His Honour noted that Dr Ford's report disclosed a serious heart condition. For this he requires the blood thinner, Warfarin, and Dr Ford noted that he required careful medical management so as to avoid any major traumatic or accidental bleeding. 

47Dr Greenaway dealt with the diabetic condition. His Honour summarised the development of the disease as it was explained in the doctor's report, and noted the doctor's concern about the suitability of the diet provided within the prison system. He further noted the doctor's conclusion that the diabetic problem was likely to remain poorly controlled and that ""in terms of the endocrinological situation and the damage already brought about to kidneys, heart, eyes, and other organs, I would be surprised for him to survive another decade."" 

48On the question of the diet, his Honour noted that the doctor was under the impression that Mr Matthews had been in custody for some 16 or 17 months, when in fact it had been a period in excess of 3 ½ years. He noted that the prognosis of 10 years life expectancy was in the context of an inadequately treated diabetic condition. I understand his Honour to have been saying that Mr Matthews had managed on a prison diet for longer than the doctor had understood, but I do not accept Mr Ramage's submission that his Honour had dismissed the doctor's opinion about life expectancy.

49His Honour summarised the history provided by Mr Matthews to Mr Watson-Munro, noting the diagnosis of a post-traumatic stress disorder which is well entrenched and will probably be with Mr Matthews for the remainder of his life. He also noted the symptoms which Mr Matthews described, including sleep disturbance, nightmares and flashbacks. He recorded Mr Watson-Munro's opinion that there was need for intensive psychological treatment to address these problems. 

50The principles governing the relevance of illness to sentence are well known and enshrined in a number of decisions of this court. His Honour did not refer to any of that authority, but it was not necessary for him to have done so. This court's decisions have repeatedly referred to the statement of the principles by King CJ in R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 589:

""The state of health of an offender is always relevant to the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the offender. The courts, however, must be cautious as to the influence which they allow this factor to have upon the sentencing process. Ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor can offenders generally expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is the responsibility of the Correctional Services authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for sick prisoners. Generally speaking ill health will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment only when it appears that imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health, or when there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender's health.""

51This passage was referred to in R v L (CCA unreported, 17 June 1996), and the court added (at p 5):

""There may be cases in which the offender's illness is such as to call for leniency as a matter of common humanity, quite apart from any effect it might have upon conditions of custody.""

52Mr Matthews' conditions would be distressing whether or not he was at liberty, and it hardly needs to be spelled out that they must render his experience of custody more unpleasant. On the other hand, the evidence does not establish that they cannot be managed within the prison system. That said, it is apparent from his Honour's remarks as a whole that he did take this matter into account in accordance with authority. No doubt, it is reflected in the finding of special circumstances. On the other hand, it was necessary for his Honour to balance that material against the undoubted seriousness of the offences, and it is apparent from the passage from his remarks cited above at [44] that he did so.

53As to his Honour's assessment of the seriousness of the drug offence, Mr Ramage noted a passage in the remarks on sentence in which the offence was described as ""organised supply of illicit drugs for the financial benefit of the offender."" He argued that the present case demonstrates no more organisation than one would expect in drug supplies of this kind. That may well be so, but his Honour's description of the offence in that way was not inapt.

54Ground four asserts error in his Honour's treatment of Mr Matthews' criminal record. In respect of both offences his Honour said that they were ""aggravated by the Form 1 matters and the offender's criminal record ... ."" Here also, Mr Ramage submitted that his Honour had wrongly treated the criminal history as a matter in aggravation. However, again, it is clear enough that his Honour was not using the word in a limited sense but was saying that the criminal history was relevant to considerations of retribution and deterrence, as explained in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, 66 NSWLR 566. This was so notwithstanding the fact that most of that criminal history was old, given the more recent convictions in Brisbane and Mr Matthews' relapse into criminal activity on this occasion.

Manifestly excessive?

55On behalf of both applicants, it was pointed out that the drug supply offence involved two transactions, each of them less than the large commercial quantity, although the two of them together amounted to a quantity which was still low in the range of that category. Reliance was placed on the small reward they stood to gain, and on the fact that, because this was an undercover police operation, the drugs were never going to be disseminated in the community.

56Mr Dhanji referred to three decisions of this court dealing with sentence for offences of this kind, while acknowledging the limited assistance they might provide. Those cases turned on their own facts, and there does not emerge from them a pattern which might provide guidance in the present case. Mr Ramage provided Judicial Commission statistics which, again, are of limited assistance.

57Most importantly, as the Crown prosecutor pointed out, in Mr Hsu's appeal to this court a ground manifest excess was rejected. As I have said, I am not persuaded that Judge Charteris erred in his discretion in arriving at an appropriate relativity between the sentence passed on Mr Hsu and those passed upon the applicants. It must also be remembered that in the case of both applicants further offences were taken into account on the Form 1, including a serious offence of supplying methylamphetamine. In all the circumstances, a submission that the sentences passed on the applicants for this offence are manifestly excessive cannot be sustained. 

58As to Mr Matthews' offence of selling firearms on an ongoing basis, it can be said again that there was no danger of those weapons being disseminated into the community. Nevertheless, it was rightly characterised by his Honour as ""an extremely serious matter."" Mr Ramage also supplied statistics in relation to that offence but, quite apart from the limitations inherent in statistics, they record only six cases. In any event, his Honour's sentence of 7 years and 3 months is within the figures which they disclose. 

59I am not persuaded that that sentence either is manifestly excessive. In sentencing for that offence also his Honour had to take into account matters on a Form 1. Further, as it was a distinct episode of criminality from the drug offence, I see no error in the extent to which sentence for the drug offence was accumulated upon it.

60Nor am I persuaded that the aggregate sentence passed upon Mr Matthews is manifestly excessive, given the totality of the criminality involved. In arriving at it his Honour had regard to all the subjective factors favouring him. In the light of Dr Greenaway's prognosis, Mr Ramage submitted that it was effectively a death sentence. An estimate of life expectancy is no more than that, and one hopes that Mr Matthews will live to enjoy release, whether on parole or at the expiration of the entire sentence. However, unpalatable as it may be, the authorities recognise that an appropriate sentence may involve the risk that the offender spends the rest of his or her life in custody: R v Holyoak [1995] 82 A Crim R 502, per Allen J at 507. 

61It is necessary, however, to specify a non-parole period in respect of the sentence on the firearms charge. Making a modest departure from the statutory proportion in recognition of his Honour's finding of special circumstances, I would fix a non-parole period of 5 years.

Orders

62Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal to Mr Dang but dismiss his appeal. 

63In relation to Mr Matthews, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal in part. I would quash the sentence on the offence of selling firearms on an ongoing basis and, taking into account the matters on the relevant Form 1, sentence him for that offence to a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 23 April 2008 and expiring on 22 April 2013, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 23 April 2013 and expiring on 22 July 2015. I would confirm the sentence for the offence of supplying ecstasy, and its commencement date. In the result, the aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with an effective non-parole period of 11 years, dating from 23 April 2008, stands. He remains eligible for release on parole on 22 April 2019.

64Davies J: I agree with Hidden J.

2763054,R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with the entirety of the reasoning and proposed orders of Johnson J. Although there were other errors, the essential matter is that the sentencing judge seriously misunderstood the facts, leading to manifestly inadequate sentences being imposed, and although his Honour's error was contributed to by the Crown (and was not corrected by counsel then appearing for the Respondent), I agree with Johnson J that it remains necessary for this Court to intervene.

2JOHNSON J: The Crown appeals under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Adam Samuel Hinchliffe, in the Sydney District Court on 14 June 2013 for offences of defrauding a body corporate, as a director, contrary to s.176A Crimes Act 1900. 

3The Respondent had pleaded guilty to five offences under s.176A, each of which was punishable by a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. In addition, the Respondent requested the Court to take into account on sentence, on a Form 1, seven further offences under s.176A. The total amount involved in the Respondent's criminal conduct was $1,512,021.30. 

4Jeffreys DCJ imposed a total effective sentence of two years' imprisonment, to be served by way of intensive correction in the community under s.7 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

5The sentences imposed by his Honour, which could not exceed two years to comply with the threshold for an intensive correction order (""ICO""), took the following form:
 





Count

Maximum Penalty

Sentence Imposed



Count 1 - On 12 September 2007, being a director of a body corporate, Meiko Australia Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”), did defraud MAP in his dealings with that body corporate ($90,782.99)

10 years’ imprisonment

Nine months’ imprisonment to date from 21 June 2013 and to expire on 20 March 2014


Count 2 - On 2 June 2008, being a director of a body corporate, MAP, did defraud MAP in his dealings with that body corporate ($150,000.00)

10 years’ imprisonment

12 months’ imprisonment to date from 21 September 2013 and to expire on 20 September 2014


Count 3 - On 4 June 2008, being a director of a body corporate, MAP, did defraud MAP in his dealings with that body corporate ($249,999.00)

10 years’ imprisonment

Nine months’ imprisonment to date from 21 June 2013 and to expire on 20 March 2014


Count 4 - On 5 June 2008, being a director of a body corporate, MAP, did defraud MAP in his dealings with that body corporate ($150,000.00)

10 years’ imprisonment

12 months’ imprisonment to date 21 December 2013 and to expire on 21 December 2014


Count 5 - On 1 August 2008, being a director of a body corporate, MAP, did defraud MAP in his dealings with that body corporate ($430,000.00)
 

10 years’ imprisonment

18 month’s imprisonment to date from 20 December 2013 and to expire on 20 June 2015
 
In passing sentence for Count 5, seven similar offences under s.176A, occurring between 5 June 2008 and 5 September 2008, were taken into account (involving a total of $441,239.89)
 
The Crown Appeal

6The Crown appeal was lodged on 17 July 2013. The Respondent was served with notice of the Crown appeal on 23 July 2013. 
 
7The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(b)Ground 1 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to adequately assess the objective gravity of the offences, or to give sufficient weight to it.

(c)Ground 2 - the sentencing Judge erred in failing to impose a sentence that properly reflected the offences before the Court by way of a Form 1 schedule.

(d)Ground 3 - the sentencing Judge erred in giving the Respondent's subjective case greater weight than was warranted, such that it impermissibly ameliorated the sentences imposed.

(e)Ground 4 - the sentencing Judge erred in giving greater weight than was warranted to rehabilitation, thus diminishing the importance of punishment and denunciation.

(f)Ground 5 - the sentencing Judge erred by failing to impose sentences that reflected the objective gravity of the crimes.

(g)Ground 6 - the sentencing Judge erred in ordering that the sentences be served by way of intensive correction orders.

(h)Ground 7 - the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.

8For the purpose of determining this appeal, it will be necessary to trace the course of the sentencing proceedings in the District Court, to seek an understanding as to how offences of this magnitude came to be disposed of by way of an ICO. The Crown contends that the sentencing process was flawed significantly, leading to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences.

Facts of the Offences

9An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered on sentence. The following narrative is drawn from that document. 

10The Respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.

11From 9 December 2004, the Respondent was the sole director of a company, Swiss Systems Pty Limited (""Swiss Systems"").

12Meiko Beteiligungs GmbH (""Meiko"") is a company which manufactures and sells dishwashers and other systems for commercial applications. Its head office and manufacturing plant is in Offenberg, Germany. Meiko has a number of subsidiaries around the world, including Meiko Australia Pacific Pty Limited (""MAP""), which was first registered as a company on 29 March 2007. 

13Prior to establishing MAP in Australia, Meiko sold its products into Australia through a dealer. That dealer was the Respondent, who conducted his business through Swiss Systems.

14In early 2007, Meiko entered into discussions with the Respondent to purchase part of the business of Swiss Systems. A Deed of Agreement for Sale was prepared and was executed on or about 5 April 2007. The Deed of Agreement contemplated that the Respondent would enter into an employment agreement with MAP. 

15On 15 April 2007, the sum of $1,544,253.70 was transferred from the account of MAP to Swiss Systems, as full payment for Meiko's part purchase of the company and stock. Under the terms of the sale, Meiko owned 900 shares in MAP and the Respondent held 100 shares. 

16During the negotiations between the Respondent and Meiko for the part sale of Swiss Systems, the Respondent was told that he would have to wind down Swiss Systems no later than December 2007, and he agreed to do so. The Respondent did not meet the deadline and was granted a final extension until 30 June 2008. Whilst Swiss Systems continued to operate, the Respondent was required to run MAP and Swiss Systems as separate entities. 

17The Respondent held the positions of managing director and company secretary of MAP from 29 March 2007 until 20 October 2008. Mr Burkhard Randel and Dr Stefan Scheringer were also directors of MAP. Throughout the same period, the Respondent was also the sole director and secretary of Swiss Systems.

18An employment agreement between the Respondent and MAP dated 31 March 2007, set out the detail of the Respondent's employment, including his remuneration and entitlements. The employment agreement was explained to the Respondent during a meeting with Mr Randel and others from Meiko in early April 2007, and it was signed by the Respondent.

19The employment agreement set out, in an attached schedule, the duties of the managing director. Those duties expressly included a duty to submit all matters deemed to be outside the normal course of business of MAP to a directors' meeting of the company for consideration and decision. Examples of matters deemed to be outside the normal course of the company's business included entering contracts for short or long term credit, as well as granting loans and credit, with the exception of according payment terms to clients under normal business practice.

20In an email dated 26 August 2008, the Respondent made an urgent request for funds from Meiko in order to pay outstanding creditors. As a result, the managing director of Meiko authorised the transfer of 400,000 Euros. The sum was transferred into the account of MAP in two parts, on 27 and 28 August 2008. As a result of the Respondent's request for an additional loan on behalf of MAP, Meiko requested financial information about MAP from the Respondent. He forwarded information on 5 September 2008. When this information was reviewed by Meiko's financial controller, Juergen Sachs, he located serious discrepancies in the accounts of MAP. Mr Sachs notified the board of Meiko and a more detailed audit was conducted.

21After further email correspondence and requests for information, the Respondent attended a meeting at the Meiko head office in Offenberg, Germany with Mr Randel and Mr Sachs. The first meeting was held on 9 October 2008. During this meeting, the Respondent was again asked to explain the unsubstantiated payments and to provide bank statements for Swiss Systems. The Respondent initially denied any knowledge of the withdrawals and stated that it could have been the bookkeeper at the time. A second meeting was held on 10 October 2008. During that meeting, the Respondent admitted to transferring the money from MAP to Swiss Systems in order to purchase a house in Mosman.

22The Respondent also told Mr Sachs and Mr Randel:

""I took the money firstly to pay the deposit on a house that came up for sale in Mosman ... I took the money out of the deposit. It was $275,000. I then applied to the bank for a loan. I could not get enough money from the bank to settle on the house even though they told me that they would lend it. I took another $430,000 out of the MAP account and paid it to Swiss Systems. On the same day, I then drew bank cheques from Swiss Systems and gave it to my solicitor to settle on the sale of the property. Those are the five cheques you can see on the statement. I am very sorry, I regret that I have done this and know I have let you down.""

23The Respondent resigned and the matter was reported to the police. 

24At the time of the meetings in October 2008, the total amount of the unauthorised transfers was thought to be $730,000.00 (Counts 2, 4 and 5). 

25Following the meetings on 9 and 10 October 2008, a number of comprehensive audits were conducted of the accounts of MAP and Swiss Systems. The audits revealed a large number of unauthorised transfers of funds from MAP to Swiss Systems by the Respondent. 

Count 1

26On 12 September 2007, the Respondent directed the transfer of 96,835.26 Euros from the MAP National Australia Bank (""NAB"") Euro Account into the Swiss Systems NAB Euro Account. 

27The application for the international telegraphic transfer recorded the purpose of the transactions as ""Payment of August 2007 Rec"". The transfer was signed by Gerald Walz. Prior to signing the transfer application, Mr Walz stated that he received approval from the Respondent.

28Of the transferred amount, $71,315.85 was used to pay Swiss Systems for the August 2007 reconciliation. That amount represented a legitimate transfer between the companies.

29The remainder of the transfer was the equivalent of $90,782.99. On 12 September 2007, $90,783.00 was deposited by Swiss Systems into a different NAB account, being a 12-month term deposit account in the name of Swiss Systems. The term deposit was listed as an asset of Swiss Systems on its 2008 balance sheet.

30At the time of the transfer, a further Swiss Systems NAB account was in deficit in the sum of $182,806.66. 

Count 2

31On 2 June 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $150,000.00 from a MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account which had been in deficit. The cheque bore the signature of the Respondent.

32No record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

Count 3

33On 4 June 2008, the Respondent sent a fax to Mark Dowling of the NAB directing him to transfer 150,000 Euros (Australian Dollars - $249,999.00) from the MAP NAB Euro Account into the Swiss Systems NAB Euro Account. This fax was on the MAP letterhead, and bore the signature of the Respondent. The transfer was completed the same day. The general ledger of MAP contained the notation ""Transfer to Swiss"".

34No other record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appears in the creditors' or debtors' ledger or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

35At the time, the Swiss Systems NAB Euro Account had a credit balance of 1,333.25 Euros. The funds obtained by the Count 3 offence were used to pay outstanding debts to Hupfer Metallwer in amounts of 105,672.49 Euros and 45,000.00 Euros.

Count 4

36On 5 June 2008, the Respondent transferred $150,000.00 from the MAP NAB account into the Swiss Systems NAB account.

37No record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

38On 10 October 2008, the Respondent admitted to having made the transfers on 2 and 5 June 2008 described above (Counts 2 and 4), in order to pay the deposit for the purchase of a property at 252 Raglan Street, Mosman. The Respondent was unsuccessful at auction, but was successful in securing the purchase of this property later that day with an offer of $2.75 million. The deposit of $275,000.00 was paid to the real estate agent, Rowan Carroll of P Leahy Pty Limited, by cheque drawn on the account of Swiss Systems on 31 May 2008, the day on which the property was listed for auction. When he handed over the cheque, the Respondent asked Mr Carroll if he would wait a few days before banking it. The cheque was banked on 4 June 2008.

Count 5

39On 1 August 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $430,000.00 from a MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account that same day. The cheque was dated 31 July 2008 and bore the signature of the Respondent. 

40The MAP general ledger included an entry ""Loan/Visa Swiss Systems P/L"". Company records were searched and there was no invoice, record, document or journal entry of MAP that related to or explained this transaction. 

41In accordance with the terms of his employment as managing director, the Respondent was required to submit all loan requests to a directors' meeting of the company. No approval was sought by the Respondent. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

42On the same date, the sum of $429,037.14 was withdrawn by the Respondent from the Swiss Systems account using five bank cheques. That amount was used as funds for settlement on the purchase of the property at 252 Raglan Street, Mosman, with that settlement occurring on 13 August 2008. 

43The Respondent applied for a mortgage with Westpac Bank on 8 June 2008. The loan was granted in an amount of $2,200,000.00. That amount fell short of the settlement of $2,475,000.00. 

44In a meeting with representatives of Meiko on 10 October 2008, the Respondent admitted having taken $430,000.00 from MAP and paying it into the Swiss Systems account, before withdrawing it through five bank cheques. He said that he did so in order to make up the shortfall between the amount of the mortgage and the total due on settlement of the Mosman property.

Form 1 - Offence 1

45On 5 June 2008, the Respondent sent a fax to Mark Dowling of the NAB directing him to transfer 50,000.00 Euros (Australian Dollars $79,573.49) from the MAP NAB Euro Account into the Swiss Systems NAB account. The fax was on the MAP letterhead and bore the Respondent's signature. The transfer was completed the same day.

46The general ledger of MAP contained the notation ""50,000 Euros to Swiss Chq"". No other record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

47The balance of the Swiss Systems NAB account was in debit in the sum of $376,847.07 prior to this transfer. The transfer (and other deposits) reduced the balance to a debit of $77,081.80 at close of business on 5 June 2008.

48On 6 June 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $50,000.00 from the Swiss Systems NAB account and deposited it into the MAP NAB account. The cheque bore the signature of the Respondent.

49At this time, the balance of the MAP NAB account went from a credit of $1,859.96 (as a result of previous transfers to pay for the deposit on the Mosman property) to a credit of $51,859.96. The inflated balance enabled bills to be paid by MAP, without the account going into overdraft.

50On 12 June 2008, the Respondent transferred $15,000.00 from the Swiss Systems NAB account to the MAP NAB account. The transfer was used to pay about $60,000.00 in wages at MAP. If the money had not been transferred, there would not have been sufficient funds in the account to cover the wages due.

51On 16 June 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $50,000.00 from the Swiss Systems NAB account to the MAP NAB account. The cheque was signed by the Respondent.

52Prior to the deposit, the MAP NAB account had a debit balance of $2,355.70 due to withdrawals made earlier in the month for the house deposit, wages and monthly expenses. The deposits allowed MAP to make a number of payments over the next few days.

Form 1 - Offence 2

53On 30 June 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $200,000.00 from the MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account on the same date. The cheque bore the Respondent's signature.

54The general ledger of MAP contained the notation ""On account of year end settlement"". However, the sum of $200,000.00 did not form part of a legitimate reconciliation between the companies.

55No other record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

Form 1 - Offence 3

56On 15 August 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $25,000.00 from the MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account on the same day. The cheque bore the Respondent's signature.

57The entry in the journal corresponding to this transaction was ""Loan/Visa Swiss Systems"".

58In accordance with the terms of his employment as managing director, the Respondent was required to submit all loan requests to a directors' meeting of the company. No approval had been sought by the Respondent. No other record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

59On 25 August 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the sum of $10,000.00 from the Swiss Systems NAB account and deposited it into the MAP NAB account. The cheque bore the Respondent's signature. The transfer kept the MAP NAB account from being overdrawn. At the time of the transfer, the MAP NAB account had a debit balance of $72.89.

60The entry in the journal corresponding to this transaction was ""Loan/Visa Swiss Systems"". The memo line read ""Transfer from Swiss"". The company records were searched and, apart from the journal entry, there was no other document, invoice or entry relating to this transaction.

Form 1 - Offence 4

61On 29 August 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $10,000.00 from the MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account. The cheque was signed by the Respondent.

62The entry in the journal corresponding to this transaction was ""Loan/Visa Swiss Systems"". 

63In accordance with the terms of his employment as managing director, the Respondent was required to submit all loan requests to a directors' meeting of the company. No approval had been sought by the Respondent.

64No record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

65The transfer enabled the Swiss Systems NAB account to avoid being overdrawn more than $200,000.00 at the end of the month.
 
Form 1 - Offence 5

66On 1 September 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the sum of $25,000.00 from the MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account. The cheque was signed by the Respondent.

67No record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

68The transfer was used by Swiss Systems to pay bills worth over $10,000.00. On the same day, the sum of $12,000.00 was transferred into the Respondent's personal NAB account from the Swiss Systems account. Prior to the transfer, the Respondent's personal NAB account was in debit in the sum of $8,516.82.

Form 1 - Offence 6

69On 5 September 2008, the Respondent sent a fax to Mark Dowling and Antoine Burke of the NAB, directing the transfer of 40,000.00 Euros (Australian Dollars $66,666.40) from the MAP NAB Euro Account into the Swiss Systems NAB account. 

70The fax was on the MAP letterhead and bore the Respondent's signature. The transfer was completed the same day.

71The entry in the journal corresponding to this transaction was ""Amount receivable S/Systems, Transfer"". 

72No other record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appeared in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers, or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

73All of the transfers referred to above fall outside the general business of MAP, and required the approval of the board of directors of MAP. At no time did the Respondent inform any person in authority, or obtain any consent for the transferring of funds described in the charges from MAP to Swiss Systems, to be applied for his own purposes or those of Swiss Systems. The Respondent did not seek approval for any loan or another advance, either to himself or Swiss Systems.

74The total amount of the 20 transactions described above, made in the period 22 August 2007 to 5 September 2008, is $1,909,974.92.

75During the same period, the Respondent made eight transfers totalling $220,621.25 to MAP from Swiss Systems. Those amounts are not referrable to a reconciliation of the companies' accounts. They were attempts by the Respondent to repay a portion of the money that he had previously transferred without authority.

Form 1 - Offence 7

76On 5 September 2008, the Respondent drew a cheque in the amount of $35,000.00 from the MAP NAB account and deposited it into the Swiss Systems NAB account. The cheque bore the Respondent's signature.

77The entry in the journal corresponding to this transaction was ""Funds Transfer"" and had been incorrectly entered as ""Other Debtors"" in the MAP ledger. 

78No record of that transaction, or any underlying transaction which may have given rise to a liability, appears in the creditors' or debtors' ledgers or any other document of MAP. It was not a legitimate reconciliation between the companies. The transfer was made by the Respondent without authority.

79After the transfer, Swiss Systems paid about $26,000.00 worth of bills and payments over the next few days.

Arrest and Charging of the Respondent on 4 January 2009

80On 4 January 2009, Detectives Watson and Philp attended the home of the Respondent at 252 Raglan Street, Mosman. The Respondent was cautioned and placed under arrest for the offences contained in Counts 2, 4 and 5. He was conveyed to Chatswood Police Station and, after receiving legal advice, he participated in an electronically recorded interview during which he declined to answer any questions. The Respondent was charged with those matters and was released on conditional bail.

Monies Not Paid Back

81There was a further agreed fact. During the course of the sentencing hearing on 2 November 2012, it was conceded by counsel for the Respondent that none of the money which had been fraudulently obtained had been paid back to the victim company, and the Court was asked to proceed on that basis (AB197).

Course of the Proceedings Against the Respondent

82The proceedings against the Respondent have had a protracted history.

83Following the charging of the Respondent on 4 January 2009, the proceedings remained in the Local Court until October 2010. 

84The Respondent was arraigned in the District Court on 15 October 2010. A trial date was fixed for May 2011. The trial date was vacated on the application of the Respondent. Thereafter, a trial date was fixed for February 2012. In that month, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the charges and the sentencing proceedings were adjourned.

85The sentencing hearing before Jeffreys DCJ extended over some 16 months commencing on 13 February 2012. 

86The substantive sentencing hearing took place before his Honour on 2 November 2012, with the tender of the Agreed Statement of Facts and other material. A number of character witnesses gave evidence on that day. Further reference will be made to this evidence. The hearing was adjourned until 29 November 2012, when Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, gave evidence. Thereafter, the proceedings were adjourned to 15 March 2013, when further evidence was given by Dr Furst. 

87The proceedings were adjourned again to 31 May 2013, following which the Respondent was remanded on bail for sentence on 14 June 2013. 

88Reference will be made later in this judgment to aspects of the evidence, and certain findings made by the sentencing Judge.

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

89The Respondent was born in March 1967. He was 40 or 41 years old at the time of the offences, and 46 years old at the time of sentence.

90The Respondent has a limited criminal history. In 2004, he was fined for a minor public order offence. In August 2010, he was convicted, with no further penalty under s.10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, for a traffic offence. Neither of these matters bore on the question of sentence for the present offences. 

91A number of medical reports were tendered on the Respondent's behalf on sentence:

(a)report dated 21 September 2010 of Dr Paul Friend, psychiatrist;

(b)report dated 29 April 2011 of Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist;

(c)reports dated 17 May 2011 and 17 May 2012 of Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist.

92In addition, a presentence report dated 16 April 2012 was furnished, together with an ICO assessment report dated 16 May 2013. 

93Each of the psychiatrists who provided reports first saw the Respondent after his arrest and charging in early 2009. No medical evidence was adduced from any practitioner who had examined or treated the Respondent before that time. 

94The Respondent informed the various psychiatrists who examined him in and after 2009 of treatment he had received in about 1998 for depression. 

95Dr Friend diagnosed the Respondent as suffering from Type II Bipolar Disorder. Dr Westmore had assessed the Respondent on fitness issues and noted the diagnosis of depression, and then Bipolar Affective Disorder, reached by other psychiatrists. Dr Furst, the Respondent's treating psychiatrist, made a diagnosis of Type II Bipolar Affective Disorder. 

96A number of character witnesses were called to give evidence on 2 November 2012. 

97Alison Pamela Lord had known the Respondent since 1994, in the context of his relationship with his late wife, who died in February 2010. Ms Lord was a close friend of the Respondent's wife. Ms Lord described the Respondent as an honest, hard-working person. She stated that the Respondent, in 2007 and 2008, appeared to be hard working and honest and she ""saw the same person that I've always seen, no different"" (AB181). According to Ms Lord, the Respondent had ""always been busy"" and had ""always been an inspired person who wants to do things, not the sort of person to sit still"". She could not ""state any particular change in a personality that I would have seen over that time, it's been the same to me since I've known him"" (AB182). Of the offences, the Respondent had told Ms Lord that he had taken money, but had given no detail.

98Dennis Patrick Kassim had met the Respondent in about September 2011. He considered the Respondent to be ""a very astute person"" and spoke highly of his dealings with the Respondent in the 14-month period in which he had known him.

99Mark Daniel Hochstadt had known the Respondent since October 2009. The Respondent had discussions with Mr Hochstadt about career options. The Respondent had offered to work for him without drawing a salary. Mr Hochstadt spoke highly of the Respondent in the limited context in which he knew him. The Respondent disclosed to Mr Hochstadt that he had been charged with defrauding a company prior to taking over the temporary management of the business. He said that he had taken about $700,000.00 to enable him to buy a home for his dying wife, to make her happy.

100Evan Raulston Dillner had known the Respondent since he and his late wife had moved into the neighbouring property in 1994. He noted that the Respondent's employment involved a good deal of travelling. Mr Dillner was aware of the ill health of the Respondent's wife, noting that the Respondent had been one of her primary carers in the last 18 months of her life. Mr Dillner stated that the Respondent had appeared normal up until the time that the Respondent told him that he had been charged, and he saw ""a bit of change in him at that time because obviously he was worried about the outcome"" (AB192). Mr Dillner did not see any mood swings or depression in the Respondent in 2007 and 2008. The Respondent told Mr Dillner that he had been charged with fraud, telling him that he had taken about $900,000.00 so that he could buy his wife a Mosman property. Mr Dillner was unaware of the actual scope of the offences.

101Michael Stewart Doughty, an accountant, had known the Respondent on a professional basis since about 2000. He regarded the Respondent to be ""very forthright, a compassionate person and very straightforward"" in his professional dealings (AB194). Mr Doughty observed that the Respondent carried out ""an extraordinarily high level of work, a lot of travelling, very focused on the success of the business"" (AB194). Mr Doughty considered the Respondent to be ""a very good character"" (AB194). Mr Doughty saw the Respondent on several occasions each month for business in 2007 and 2008. He was ""stressed because it was a new business"" and appeared ""very focused on the business, driven for the success of the business, excited about the prospects of Meiko"" (AB196).

102According to the presentence report, the Respondent is the eldest of two children, having a younger sister. He also has an elder stepbrother. The Respondent reported having a difficult childhood. He detailed a history of ownership of various catering equipment-based businesses since 1992. The Respondent informed Dr Furst of aspects of his difficult childhood and that his mother had a history of mental health problems.

103The presentence report dated 16 April 2012 noted that the Applicant had been employed since April 2010 as a designer and sales person in a luxury kitchen business. His employer described the Respondent as a valued employee. 

104Civil proceedings were brought against the Respondent by MAP, in which judgments were obtained in December 2008 in the sum of $730,000.00, and in May 2009 in the sum of $865,305.60. A sequestration order was made against the Respondent rendering him bankrupt in October 2009. 

105The Respondent informed the author of the ICO assessment report dated 16 May 2013 that he was unemployed and in receipt of a disability support pension. 

106I note that in an affidavit sworn on 18 November 2013 for the purpose of this appeal, the Respondent indicated that he received a disability support pension and has ended up impoverished with no prospects of employment. 

107A further report of Dr Furst dated 26 November 2013 was tendered at the hearing of the appeal, in the event that the Court found error and issues of discretion and resentencing arose for consideration. In that report, Dr Furst (who had seen the Respondent regularly since February 2009) stated that the Respondent was working for Sydney Woodworkers, based in Brookvale. Dr Furst noted that the Respondent lived in a Department of Housing dwelling at Lane Cove, and was in receipt of a disability support pension for bipolar disorder.

108Mr Odgers SC, for the Respondent, clarified the position at the hearing before this Court, indicating that his instructions were that the Respondent had ceased his employment with Sydney Woodworkers after he learned that the Crown had appealed against sentence in July 2013. 

109The Respondent has been in a relationship with a new partner since August 2010. The partner has a teenage daughter. The Respondent has no children of his own.

110Reference will be made later to a finding of contrition made by the sentencing Judge (see [161] below). With respect to issues of contrition or remorse, the following matters should be noted:

(a)following the Respondent's initial denial at the meeting in Germany on 9 October 2008 with Meiko representatives (at which he said it could have been the bookkeeper), the Respondent made certain admissions at the meeting the next day and expressed regret for what he had done;

(b)following the commencement of civil proceedings against him by MAP, the Respondent contested liability as to part of the sum which is the subject of the present offences, with judgment being granted against him in this respect in May 2009;

(c)it was not until February 2012, more than three years after he had been arrested and charged, that the Respondent indicated that he would plead guilty to the charges (with a number of matters on a Form 1);

(d)in April 2012, the Respondent told the author of the presentence report that a number of the financial transactions to which his current offences related, were due to the actions of the financial controller employed by his company at that time, although he acknowledged that he felt that he was ultimately responsible for the transactions in his capacity as the director of the company (AB58);

(e)in May 2013, the Respondent told the author of the ICO assessment report that the company's financial controller had failed in that person's duties, with the author noting that the Respondent ""seemed to accept responsibility being the director of the company and it appears that financial and material gains were contributing factors in his offending behaviour"" (AB64).
 
Course of the Sentencing Proceedings and Some Findings in the Remarks on Sentence

111Before moving to consider the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to chart the course of the sentencing proceedings and, in particular, certain issues which have assumed particular significance before this Court. 

112As previously noted, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the five counts on 13 February 2012, and asked for seven offences to be taken into account on Count 5. 

Sentencing Hearing on 2 November 2012

113The sentencing proceedings were adjourned over a number of months with the principal sentencing hearing taking place before his Honour on 2 November 2012. It should be observed that the Respondent was represented by the same counsel on each occasion on which he appeared before the District Court.

114The Crown written submissions dated 2 November 2012 addressed issues of fact and law, culminating in the submission that ""taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the large amount of money involved, the fact there had been no reparation, and that the offences were committed for greed over a long period of time involving a breach of trust as a director, a lengthy full time custodial sentence is appropriate"" (AB94).

115Written submissions of defence counsel on sentence focused upon the Respondent's subjective circumstances (AB165-166).

116The character witnesses referred to earlier (at [97]-[101]) were called to give evidence on 2 November 2012. The Respondent was not called to give evidence. The psychiatric reports then in existence were tendered, as was the presentence report.

117At the completion of the evidence, the Crown Prosecutor addressed on sentence, speaking to her written submissions. The Crown Prosecutor addressed the objective gravity of the offences noting, amongst other things, that it was a case of ""greed not need"" (AB198). The Crown Prosecutor pointed to the amount of money involved, the length of time over which the offences had been committed, the motive for the crime, the degree of planning and sophistication involved and an accompanying breach of trust. His Honour enquired as to whether financial gain was implicit in s.176A Crimes Act 1900 offences, with the Crown submitting that these offences involved financial gain for the Respondent (AB198-199). 

118Counsel for the Respondent then addressed the sentencing Judge (AB199ff). Emphasis was placed upon the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including the psychiatric evidence. It was submitted that the offences did not involve planned or organised criminal activity. No submission was made for the Respondent that he did not gain personally with respect to any of the offences for which he was to be sentenced. 

119Counsel for the Respondent raised tentatively the topic of an ICO - ""I'd ask your Honour to consider taking all of the circumstances into account a slim possibility of an intensive correction order"" (AB201). 

120Some reference was made to the delay in the proceedings between January 2009 and November 2012, with a submission that delay should be taken into account in the Respondent's favour (AB200-201). 

121The sentencing Judge observed, correctly, by reference to the cross-examination of character witnesses, that ""The Crown seems to be in cross-examination challenging what the experts are saying in relation to his mental difficulties in 2007 and 2008"" (AB202). His Honour referred to part of Dr Furst's report in the following exchange with counsel for the Respondent (AB202, lines 9-24) (emphasis added):

""HIS HONOUR: ... So you say, do you, that a consequence of what Dr Furst says in his second report where Dr Furst on page 8 says 'It's likely Mr Hinchliffe's mood was unstable at the time in question before the court, he may well have been experiencing some symptoms of hypomania. Although he was aware his actions at the time his judgment was poor'.

You say, do you, that there's evidence of a connection, not that you need it, but there's evidence of connection between the offending and his mental difficulties? Is that what you say?

[DEFENCE COUNSEL]: The highest I could put it is the possibility of that having occurred, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It's not just a possibility, the expert says it's likely. I'll see what the Crown has to say about that in a moment.""

122His Honour then stated to the Crown Prosecutor that she had not sought to cross-examine Dr Furst. The Crown Prosecutor pointed to aspects of Dr Furst's report, and the absence of evidence from the Respondent, and submitted that counsel for the Respondent had been correct in submitting that the medical evidence suggested nothing more than a possibility of some connection between the Respondent's mental condition and his offences (AB203). The Crown submitted that there was insufficient material in the reports for the Court to find that the Respondent was suffering at the time of the offences from a mental illness. 

123The sentencing Judge noted again that there had been no cross-examination of Dr Furst. The Crown emphasised again that there had been cross-examination of the witnesses who had been called (the character witnesses), but that the Respondent had not given evidence (AB206). It was then determined that the proceedings should be adjourned to allow Dr Furst to be called for cross-examination.

124I pause at this point to note that the real issue which had arisen in the sentencing hearing involved the absence of evidence from the Respondent. It was for the sentencing Judge to make findings, on the balance of probabilities, as to any relevant nexus between the Respondent's mental state and his offending. 

125In circumstances where there was a very live issue concerning the factual substratum upon which the psychiatrists had depended, the calling of Dr Furst to give oral evidence was not likely to advance the matter. 

126The Crown position, at that point, involved reliance upon R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79] with respect to reliance by an offender upon a history provided to psychiatrists, without the Respondent being called at the sentencing hearing to give direct evidence of relevant matters, in particular, in areas of controversy. On an issue such as this (any connection between a mental condition and the criminal conduct), the Respondent carried the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28]. Given the point which had been reached in the sentencing hearing, the only effective way in which the Respondent could discharge the onus of proof on this issue was to give evidence himself, thereby exposing himself to cross-examination. The Respondent did not take this course, although there were clear opportunities for him to do so. 

Sentencing Hearing on 29 November 2012

127Proceedings were adjourned until 29 November 2012, with Dr Furst giving evidence and being cross-examined by (a different) Crown Prosecutor. 

128Once again, the Crown position was made clear that Dr Furst's opinions were based upon self-reports by the Respondent (AB218). At the conclusion of the evidence of Dr Furst, the proceedings were further adjourned. The sentencing Judge requested defence counsel to obtain some evidence concerning the Respondent's bankruptcy and its relationship to the agreed unpaid loss (AB 227).
 
Sentencing Hearing on 15 March 2013

129The proceedings next came before the sentencing Judge on 15 March 2013. The same counsel again appeared for the Respondent with yet another Crown Prosecutor appearing in the proceedings. 

130Documentary evidence relating to the Respondent's bankruptcy and the civil proceedings was tendered (AB229-230). Contained within the documents tendered by the Respondent on this occasion were emails sent in February and March 2011, which indicated that the Respondent had been offered a position as a catering operations consultant with a firm which did business with Meiko. That firm made contact with Meiko by email, indicating that the Respondent had assured the firm that the issues between Meiko and the Respondent would not pose any difficulty. 

131Meiko responded by email noting the ongoing legal dispute with the Respondent, and the substantial damage he had caused Meiko. In those circumstances, Meiko indicated that, if the Respondent was employed with the firm, the business relationship between Meiko and that firm would cease (AB160-161). The Respondent did not obtain employment with the firm.

132The response of the sentencing Judge to this material was to express the view that Meiko had ""destroyed"" the ""real and genuine efforts"" of the Respondent to seek to repay the funds defrauded by him (AB232-233). The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that the Respondent had been bankrupted in 2009, so that events in 2011 may not have much bearing on the issue (AB233).

133Once again, I pause to observe that Meiko's position seemed entirely understandable. In February-March 2011, the Respondent was awaiting trial on charges of defrauding MAP of some $1.5 million. It might be considered quite unrealistic for the Respondent to seek employment with a firm in the same industry where he would be required to have commercial dealings with Meiko. Given Meiko's experience with the Respondent, arising from events which were still before the criminal courts, it was reasonable for Meiko to express the firm view that it could have no trust in him, and any commercial dealings with him.

134The sentencing Judge came to utilise this issue in the Respondent's favour on sentence. Viewed objectively, this issue was neutral at best for the Respondent. In circumstances where he had been bankrupted in 2009, it is difficult to see how this employment opportunity in 2011, and Meiko's response to it, bore at all upon the question of sentence. 

135In any event, as the April 2012 presentence report indicated (see [103] above), the Respondent had been in employment since April 2010. 

136Ordinarily, no particular reference to an issue such as this would be called for on an appeal to this Court. However, the sentencing Judge appears to have regarded this aspect of the evidence as a pivotal issue in his decision to seek an assessment of the suitability of the Respondent for an ICO, with an assessment of that type only being permissible where the Court has formed the view that a sentence of no more than two years' imprisonment is likely: s.69(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour determined that this course should be taken in what he described as ""very special circumstances, particularly where the complainant [Meiko] has put itself in a position where it's resisted this man's best endeavours"" (AB237). 

137Dr Furst was recalled to give further evidence on 15 March 2013. He was shown the transcript of evidence of the character witnesses adduced on 2 November 2012, and commented upon that evidence (AB240-248). 

138The proceedings were adjourned to 31 May 2013 and his Honour requested an ICO assessment concerning the Respondent. 
 
Sentence Hearing on 31 May 2013

139On 31 May 2013, the same counsel appeared once again for the Respondent. A solicitor appeared for the Crown. It was on this occasion, for the first time, that his Honour directed a number of questions to the solicitor representing the Crown concerning the Agreed Statement of Facts, including the question whether the Respondent had benefited personally from the offences. This questioning occupied a number of pages of transcript (AB249-259). 

140The tenor of his Honour's questions was whether there was evidence which would satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt that the Respondent benefited personally from all the offences. It must be said that his Honour squarely proceeded on the basis, which was confirmed by the Crown, that Meiko owned 90% of Swiss Systems. The solicitor for the Crown appears to have done his best to respond to the questions, although he noted at one point that he ""thought the matter was for judgment"" and ""didn't really prepare myself"" (AB258). The sentencing Judge observed, correctly, ""You've been caught on the hop"" (AB258). 

141It is necessary for this Court to bear in mind this context in determining what use can be made of this course of questioning directed by his Honour to the Crown representative. 

142It is noteworthy, as well, that his Honour did not direct any questions on this topic to counsel for the Respondent, who had appeared throughout the sentencing proceedings.

143His Honour indicated that a discount of 12.5% would be allowed for the Respondent's pleas of guilty (AB260). 

144The Crown repeated the submission made earlier that a sentence of imprisonment of more than two years was appropriate, so that an ICO was not available as a matter of jurisdiction (AB260-262). The matter was stood over for sentence on 14 June 2013. 

Remarks on Sentence on 14 June 2013

145The remarks on sentence commenced with a short description of the five offences and the seven matters on the Form 1. His Honour then observed, with respect to the Form 1 matters (ROS2, AB14) (emphasis added):

""I note, having availed himself of this arrangement, that is the Form 1, the offender has the benefit of not facing sentences of imprisonment for those additional offences, however by clearing the slate in this way as it is described he has provided considerable utility which must be brought to account to the offender. I do not overlook though that it could not be said that the offender would not have been inculpated in these additional offences but for his acknowledgement that he committed them, Attorney General's reference 56 NSWLR 146 at 65. The additional offences should impinge upon the sentence for the principal offence to a significant or marginal extent requiring an appropriate increase in the sentence that would otherwise be applied for the principal offence standing alone, Attorney General's reference at 42. The maximum penalty for each offence on the indictment and for the offences on the Form 1 are ten years imprisonment.""

146A discount of 12.5% was allowed for the Respondent's pleas of guilty.

147The sentencing Judge then moved to a recital of the facts of the offences. Much of what his Honour said in this regard was drawn from the Agreed Statement of Facts. However, apparently drawing upon the exchange with the solicitor for the Crown on 31 May 2013, his Honour made a number of further findings which the Crown contends involved a misunderstanding of the facts. This issue will be considered under the first ground of appeal.

148The Crown written submissions had addressed a number of features of s.176A offences, which bear upon an assessment of the objective gravity of offences of this type - the amount of money involved, the length of time over which the offences are committed, the motive for the crime, the degree of planning and sophistication and an accompanying breach of trust. His Honour addressed some, but not all, of these issues (ROS10-11, AB22-23). 

149Firstly, his Honour found that the amount of money involved was a very large sum and that the loss was effectively irretrievable.

150Secondly, his Honour observed that ""At first blush it would appear that the offences were committed over a lengthy period of time"", but that he would ""have something to say about that in due course"" (ROS10, AB22). It was common ground in this Court that his Honour did not return to this topic in the remarks on sentence.

151Thirdly, his Honour referred to motive, but said nothing more about it. 

152Fourthly, the sentencing Judge observed that there seemed to be ""not a great deal of planning but certainly some planning"" (ROS10, AB22).

153Fifthly, his Honour observed that there was an accompanying breach of trust.

154The sentencing Judge referred to a number of authorities supporting the relevance of the five enumerated factors to the question of assessment of objective gravity, without further comment.

155Next, his Honour turned to the Respondent's subjective circumstances (ROS11-12, AB23-24).

156The sentencing Judge then turned to the circumstances of the offences. His opening observation contains a statement which the Crown says is factually incorrect (ROS12, AB24):

""It is important to understand the circumstances of the offending. So far as the amount on 12 September 2007, which is the first count in the indictment, it seems that that amount was deposited into Swiss Systems, at that time, as I understand it, and I checked this with the Crown on the last occasion, that company effectively was owned ninety per cent by the German Company and ten per cent by the offender.

There is no evidence that could satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt and the Crown conceded this, that that amount of money came to the personal account of the offender or that the offender benefited personally from that money, certainly the offender used that money for a company for which he had a substantial but lesser interest.""

157It was not correct that Meiko owned 90% and the Respondent 10% of Swiss Systems. This arrangement applied to MAP (see [15] above). It was the Respondent who continued to own and operate Swiss Systems at this time.

158His Honour then turned to offences committed in the context of the purchase by the Respondent of the property at 252 Raglan Street, Mosman. His Honour said (ROS12-13, AB24-25):

""In relation to the amounts drawn on 2 June, 5 June and 1 August, being $150,000, on 2 June, $150,000 on 5 June and $430,000 on 1 August. It is important to understand that the offender was interested in purchasing 252 Raglan Street.

On 28 May 2008 he attended a certain bank, the details of which are known in the proceedings and for a proposed budget bank briefing. He had a discussion with one of the bank managers and it was indicted [sic] that he wished to purchase the premises at 252 Raglan Street and the bank effectively indicated to him that they would be happy to loan the funds for the purchase.

On 31 May 2008 the offender attended the auction in relation to 252 Raglan Street. The property was passed in at auction and in subsequent negotiations, the offender agreed to purchase the premises for $2.75 million dollars, that offer was accepted and a cheque for $275,000 was given by way of a deposit. On 2 June 2008 the offender contacted the bank manager's assistant and began the process of making the loan application with that bank.

On 14 June 2008 the offender spoke to the bank manager's manger [sic] who indicated that due to the financial climate it was unlikely that the loan which had been discussed on 28 May 2008 would be approved. The loan was subsequently refused. Eventually, the offender obtained a loan of $2.2 million dollars from another bank. It seems to me that the facts are, that Swiss Systems which was the company that the offender had was the agent for Meiko. Meiko agreed to purchase the agency Swiss Systems and effectively, the offender obtained ten per cent of a subsequent company and Meiko obtained ninety per cent.""

159His Honour continued in passages which disclosed further factual misunderstanding (ROS13-14, AB25-26):

""So far as the payments on 12 September 2007, 4 June 2008 and 5 June 2008, namely $90,073 which is the first count on the indictment; $240,999 which is the third count in the indictment, and $79,573.49 which is the first count on the Form 1; $200,000 on 30 June 2008 which is the second count on the Form 1; $25,000 on 15 August 2008 which is the third count on the Form 1; $10,000 on 29 August 2008 which is the fourth count on the Form 1; $66,666.40 which was the sixth count on the Form 1; $35,000 on 5 September which is the seventh count on the Form all that money went to the account of Swiss Systems.

In relation to the amount of $25,000 on 1 September 2008 which is the fifth count on the Form 1, of that $25,000 which went into Swiss Systems, $12,000 was paid to the personal account of the offender. All the payments to Swiss Systems were not authorised, there is no evidence that would satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the offender personally benefited from the payments made to Swiss Systems.

It is important in my view to take into account that the fact that, although the offender was involved in the amount in the indictment of the Form 1, it seems to me that the facts are that the offender personally benefited in the sense that the money went to his account for the payments on 2 June 2008, 5 June 2008, 1 August 2008, and 1 September 2008. So far as the payments on 2 June 2008, the 5 June 2008 and the 1 August 2008 which went to the purchase of 252 Raglan Street, that is an amount of $730,000.

On 1 September 2008 there is another amount of $12,000 out of the $25,000, that $12,000 went to the personal account of the offender.""

160His Honour noted that the Respondent had been made bankrupt in September 2009 with his main creditor being Meiko. Reference was then made to the emails of February-March 2011 in which the Respondent sought employment in the same industry and Meiko expressed an unwillingness to deal with him (ROS14-15, AB26-27).

161His Honour made a finding of contrition in favour of the Respondent (ROS15, AB27):

""I am satisfied that on 10 October 2008 the offender admitted to Meiko that he had taken without authority the sum of $730,000. That in my view is an indication of contrition. On 5 December 2008 the offender consented to judgment to $730,000 in the Supreme Court proceedings. His contrition is also indicated, in my view, in his plea of guilty and also in the evidence of Dr Furst and the report that I have from Dr Furst.""

162In finding contrition, a number of the matters referred to at [110] above were not mentioned.

163His Honour then stated that the Respondent ""has had for many, many years mental difficulties which are set out in various psychiatric reports that I have"" (ROS15, AB27). Extensive reference was then made to parts of the psychiatric reports (ROS15-19, AB27-31). His Honour referred to well-known passages from the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]-[178]. A finding was then made in the following terms (ROS20, AB32):

""In this case, I am satisfied that on balance, having heard the evidence of Dr Furst, that the offender has been suffering from mental difficulties that he has, untreated, for many, many years. I am satisfied on balance that at the time of this offending the offender was suffering from that mental difficulty. I am satisfied on balance, according to the evidence of Dr Furst, that the offender's judgment in relation to the matters would have been impaired. I take those matters into account. I am also satisfied that the offender is still suffering from the mental disorder that he has, although he is being treated and he has progressed in that treatment and there is insight in relation to the treatment and the offending.""

164No reference was made to the Crown's repeated submission that a finding to this effect should not be made given the absence of evidence from the Respondent. His Honour at no stage in his remarks on sentence referred to the fact that there was an absence of evidence from the Respondent to support Dr Furst's opinion and the significance of such absence.

165His Honour then referred to authorities concerning totality, concurrence and accumulation (ROS20-21, AB32-33).

166His Honour then said (ROS21-22, AB33-34):

""In this matter, I am of the view that the offending in relation to the $730,000 and the $12,000 needs to be looked at differently from the other offending, but I propose to impose sentences which, taking into account the principles of totality, are partially cumulative and some are concurrent. I intend to impose sentences taking into account the principles that I have spoken of, including questions of general deterrence and other matters that I have referred to. It seems to me that the only appropriate sentence to be imposed is a sentence of full-time imprisonment.""

167The sentencing Judge then identified the specific sentences identified at the commencement of this judgment. Reference was then made to the decision of this Court in R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225; 82 NSWLR 60 at 84 [108]-[109], 90 [141].

168His Honour provided the following reasons for sentencing the Respondent by way of an ICO (ROS23, AB35):

""I have determined that it is appropriate for the offender to serve the sentences by way of intensive correction order. My reasons are the circumstances of the offending, the second reason is that I accept that the offender has taken considerable steps towards rehabilitation beyond that which the Court usually sees. In particular, I am impressed by the psychiatric reports in that regard. The offender admitted his offending to his German partners in October 2008 and it seems that, by February 2009 - admittedly he had been arrested a short time previously - he attended Dr Furst.

As at May 2012, the offender had been attending Dr Furst for psychiatric therapy on no less than fifty occasions. Dr Furst, as I understand it, is still the treating doctor, and the offender, according to Dr Furst, was progressing extremely well. It is important to understand that prior to the intervention of Dr Furst, and eventually the Black Dog Institute, the offender's mental difficulties had previously been undiagnosed.

The third reason is that in my view the offender has shown contrition. Importantly, he has also shown according to Dr Furst insight into his offending and the steps that he is taking, that is, the therapy with Dr Furst and the psychologist, to deal with what is obviously a personal problem producing serious criminal behaviour. In my view, it would not be of assistance to the offender, it would not be in the interests of justice or the community to curtail the offender's rehabilitation progress.""

169His Honour then proceeded to make orders, directing that the sentence commence from 21 June 2013. 

Approach to the Grounds of Appeal

170The Crown identified seven grounds of appeal. It was submitted for the Crown that Grounds 1-6 identify errors on the part of the sentencing Judge, which serve to explain the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences, the complaint contained in Ground 7.

171Mr Odgers SC submitted that Grounds 1-6 should be regarded as particulars only of Ground 7. 

172Insofar as the Crown sought to make complaint concerning certain factual findings (areas of misunderstanding arising from the discussion on 31 May 2013), in the manner advanced by the Crown in support of Ground 1, Mr Odgers SC submitted that such a complaint should be the subject of a specific ground of appeal.

173In support of these submissions, he referred to passages in the decisions of the High Court of Australia in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 and Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022.

174At the outset, I accept that it is open to the Crown to advance grounds of appeal of the type relied upon in this case. The Crown has identified seven grounds which ought be considered by this Court, and not regarded as mere particulars of Ground 7. 

175Further, in the circumstances of this case, it is open to the Crown to complain (under Ground 1) about the sentencing Judge's misunderstanding as to the facts, without the need for a specific ground in those terms. There can be no doubt that the Respondent was on notice of the Crown's argument in this respect, and was in a position to meet it, if he saw fit to do so. Senior counsel for the Respondent approached this topic by reference to technical and procedural issues. He told this Court (T11.11-15, 2 December 2013):

""Now, I haven't made any submission about what the true position is one way or the other. I am not going to make a submission about that. The evidence is unclear, in the sense that the facts were ambiguous and the Crown position was interpreted in one way; the judge interpreted it in one way. I respectfully submit no error is shown on the part of the judge.""

176I have approached this aspect of Ground 1, noting the position of the Respondent on this factual question. 

177I am satisfied that it is open to the Crown to proceed in this way, in advancing grounds and submissions in support of this Crown appeal.

Ground 1 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Failing to Adequately Assess the Objective Gravity of the Offences or to Give Sufficient Weight to it

Submissions of the Crown

178The Crown submitted that it was difficult to conclude with any precision from the remarks on sentence, what view the sentencing Judge took of the objective gravity of these offences although, given the sentences imposed, his Honour could not have regarded them as being particularly serious. It was noted that no assessment of objective gravity had been made.

179The Crown noted that the sentencing Judge had referred to features relevant to the assessment of the gravity of the offences, but that his Honour did not at any stage articulate his own assessment. It was submitted that this Court should readily infer, from the use of an ICO in this case, that his Honour viewed the objective gravity of the offending conduct as being relatively low.

180Whilst acknowledging that the characterisation of the gravity of an offence is classically within the discretionary role of the sentencing Judge, the Crown submitted that the sentencing discretion had miscarried substantially in this case. Reference was made to the sum of money involved, and the extended period of time over which the offences were committed, as indicating that the offences involved substantial dishonesty and could only be punished by a sentence of full-time imprisonment.

181In support of this ground, the Crown submitted that his Honour had regard to facts contrary to those agreed to by the parties, and which were more favourable to the Respondent than the evidence in fact established. The Crown acknowledged that there was a degree of ambiguity in the Agreed Statement of Facts, together with incorrect information provided by the Crown in oral submissions on 31 May 2013 (and not corrected by the Respondent) and that this contributed to the error.

182The sentencing Judge proceeded to sentence on the basis that all but the monies directly applied by the Respondent to the purchase of the Mosman property, plus an additional $12,000.00 that went to the Respondent's personal bank account, were simply moved from one company owned by Meiko to another which was 90% owned by Meiko, with no personal benefit accruing to the Respondent. 

183The Crown submitted that this was not correct. What Meiko purchased was not the Swiss Systems company, but the agency business of Swiss Systems. The business purchased by Meiko was conducted by MAP, and was not linked to Swiss Systems, other than by the assumption of its business, and the commonality of the Respondent as employee of one and owner/director of the other. Part of the payment to the Respondent for his business was a 10% stake in MAP (this being the apparent genesis of the sentencing Judge's error as to Meiko's 90% ownership of Swiss Systems). As noted in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Respondent was required to wind up Swiss Systems as part of the overall transaction.

184The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge misconstrued part of the Agreed Statement of Facts to mean that MAP and Swiss Systems were both subsidiaries of the same parent company, with monies transferred from the one to the other still owned by Meiko, and applied to its general benefit. The Crown submitted that his Honour relied upon this factual misunderstanding to reduce the gravity of the offences to little more than an accounting irregularity.

185The Crown submitted that all of the monies transferred fraudulently from MAP to Swiss Systems went to the benefit of the Respondent, or to his wholly owned company. The Crown noted that the Respondent had discussed the company structure (accurately) with Dr Westmore, who recorded this information in his report of 29 April 2011 (AB101). What the Respondent said to Dr Westmore is not consistent with the construction adopted by the sentencing Judge. 

186The Crown submitted that this error in interpreting the facts caused the sentencing Judge to greatly underestimate the seriousness of the Respondent's crimes, in that his Honour clearly distinguished between those offences where the fraudulently obtained monies went to a Swiss Systems account, and those monies that went to fund the Respondent's real estate purchase at Mosman, or were paid to his personal bank account. 

187It was submitted that the error was a significant one, and must have led the sentencing Judge to assess the objective gravity of the Respondent's crimes as having considerably reduced seriousness than was the true position. The Crown submitted that, had the sentencing Judge properly and adequately assessed the objective gravity of the offences, and accorded it proper weight, he could not have concluded (as he apparently did) that these were not serious crimes.

188The Crown pointed to the following features, which ought to have been given full weight by the sentencing Judge:

(a)the offences involved a deliberate and considered course of dishonesty;

(b)the dishonest conduct was motivated by a desire for financial gain;

(c)the funds obtained by the Respondent were almost exclusively applied to his personal financial advantage, or to the advantage of a company wholly owned by him, with the ultimate aim of supporting a luxurious lifestyle;

(d)the course of dishonesty involved the creation of false accounting entries which were intended to conceal the Respondent's crimes;

(e)the Respondent was engaged in deceptive conduct over a period of one year to give effect to, and to conceal, his crimes;

(f)as a director of a company operating in Australia, but owned by an international company, the Respondent's crimes represented a particularly grave breach of trust, in that the Respondent was not subject to the supervision of a locally based board - he was able to take advantage of his trusted position, and the lack of local oversight, to carry out the crimes and to conceal the fraud over a year;

(g)the Respondent had been trusted to fulfil the role, not just of managing director, but also of company secretary, the offences constituting an additional breach of trust in this regard;

(h)the amount of money involved in the fraud was considerable, in excess of $1.5 million, with fraud of this dimension clearly representing a significant loss to the company defrauded;

(i)the offences taken into account on the Form 1, with respect to Count 5, were in themselves significant crimes requiring an appreciable increase in the penalty imposed on that count;

(j)no restitution had been made by the Respondent to the company that had sustained the loss.

189As a result of the sentencing Judge's erroneous and inadequate review of the facts of the crimes, and their seriousness, the Crown submitted that an overall sentence was ultimately imposed which was incommensurate with the significant criminality involved, and was incapable of fulfilling the requirement for reasonable proportionality between the sentence imposed and the circumstances of the crime: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR(NSW) 554 at 556; R v Ball [2013] NSWCCA 126 at [120].

Submissions of the Respondent

190Mr Odgers SC submitted that this ground of appeal had not been made out. He submitted that it was unnecessary for the sentencing Judge to embark upon a detailed finding as to where the offences lay on a range of objective seriousness. 

191Senior counsel submitted that it was the obligation of the sentencing Judge to undertake a process of instinctive synthesis, and his Honour did so. There was no general obligation to give more weight to the objective gravity of the offences over the Respondent's subjective features. 

192Reference was made as well to his Honour's findings concerning the Respondent's impecuniosity, and his efforts to make repayments of the defrauded funds. 

193With respect to the areas of factual misunderstanding relied upon by the Crown, Mr Odgers SC submitted that it was open to his Honour to approach these matters upon the basis that the Crown had not demonstrated the contrary position beyond reasonable doubt. As mentioned earlier (at [175]), senior counsel refrained from making a submission concerning the accuracy of the matter.

194It was submitted that the Crown had not demonstrated that it was not open to the sentencing Judge to make the findings sought to be challenged under the first ground of appeal.

Decision

195It may be taken that this Court will be slow to interfere with discretionary determinations of sentencing Judges concerning the objective gravity of offences: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]-[47]. 

196To overturn a factual finding by a sentencing Judge, it is necessary for this Court to be satisfied that there was an error of principle, or a mistake of fact or law, such that the sentencing discretion of the trial Judge miscarried. In its review, the Court is bound by findings of fact by the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in the sense referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [61].

197However, what has been demonstrated in this case is an incomplete process of assessment of objective gravity by the sentencing Judge. 

198Further, there is an irresistible inference to be drawn from orders actually made, that his Honour regarded the Respondent's offences as being at a relatively low level of objective gravity. Such a finding was not open in this case.

199I am satisfied that his Honour misconstrued the facts as part of the sentencing process. The fact that this was contributed to by Crown submissions on the last day of the sentencing hearing will be considered further on the question of the exercise of the residual discretion. 

200It should be observed, however, that the Respondent had pleaded guilty to the five counts of fraud contained in the indictment, and had admitted his guilt of the seven counts to be taken into account on the Form 1. 

201Added to that were the contents of the Agreed Statement of Facts, which quantified the sums obtained as a result of the frauds, and which, it was agreed, had not been repaid at all to the victim company. 

202At no point, until his Honour raised the issue on the last hearing day, was there any submission on behalf of the Respondent that he had not gained financially as a result of all of the offences. The Crown had made specific submissions that there had been financial benefit on his part. To the extent that it may possibly be relevant, there was nothing in the various reports tendered in the sentencing proceedings which indicated that the Respondent had not himself benefited financially from all offences. Further, no submission had been made by counsel for the Respondent by reference to the shareholding arrangement relied upon (incorrectly) by his Honour. 

203In these circumstances, it would appear that it was his Honour who raised this issue at the end of the sentencing hearing, with questions (without notice) being directed to a solicitor for the Crown, who was in attendance for a limited purpose, and who (according to the transcript) was not prepared to engage upon a detailed discussion of this aspect of the case. Questions of this type had not been directed to the Crown Prosecutors who had appeared on earlier hearing days. Notably, enquiries of this type were not directed by his Honour to counsel for the Respondent, who had been in attendance throughout the sentencing hearing. 

204There is a further issue, however, which arises in this context. In the circumstances of this case, given the pleas of guilty, the Agreed Statement of Facts and other material, the onus would appear to be upon the Respondent, on the balance of probabilities, to establish that he had not gained personally from a substantial number of the offences of dishonesty to which he had pleaded guilty. A finding along these lines might operate to reduce sentence. In accordance with the principles in Olbrich v The Queen, this would seem to be an issue where the Respondent bore the onus of proof to the civil standard. To the extent that the sentencing Judge raised this issue, near the end of the sentencing hearing, upon the assumption that this was an issue for the Crown to negative beyond reasonable doubt, this does not appear to be the correct approach in law. 

205Mr Odgers SC submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to regard this aspect as being one requiring proof to the criminal standard by the Crown. Alternatively, he submitted that this may fall into that category of case where the material available to the sentencing Judge will not permit the Court to resolve the issue in a way that goes to increase or to decrease the sentence to be imposed: Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629 at 636-637 [19], [22].

206I do not accept this submission. If the Respondent sought such a finding in mitigation of penalty, he carried the onus of proof to the civil standard.

207However, error is demonstrated whichever approach is to be taken to the onus of proof.

208His Honour misunderstood the true facts in at least two respects. Firstly, a mistaken finding was made concerning personal benefit to the Respondent. Secondly, a mistaken finding was made by reference to the shareholding issue.

209I note, in any event, that even if it were the case that it was his company, Swiss Systems, and not the Respondent personally, who benefited from the fraudulent obtaining of about $820,000.00, this would do little to mitigate the seriousness of the offences: R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [17].

210The features of this case identified by the Crown at [188] above all point to an erroneous approach on the part of the sentencing Judge in an assessment of the objective gravity of these offences, culminating in the imposition of a sentence utilising an ICO. 

211I am satisfied that Ground 1 has been established.

Ground 2 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Failing to Impose a Sentence Which Properly Reflected the Offences Before the Court by way of a Form 1 Schedule

Submissions of the Crown

212The Crown submitted that the seven offences on the Form 1, to be taken into account on sentence for Count 5, were objectively serious and involved a further $441,239.89 defrauded by the Respondent. An appreciable increase in the sentence imposed for Count 5 ought to have resulted. The Crown submitted, however, that the sentence actually imposed (18 months' imprisonment) demonstrated a clear failure to impose a sentence that gave proper regard to the Form 1 matters. 

213Further, the Crown submitted that the factual misunderstanding on the part of the sentencing Judge (considered under Ground 1) affected the Form 1 matters as well. 

214To the extent that the sentencing Judge identified that the additional offences should be taken into account upon sentence for the principal offence ""to a significant or marginal extent"" (see [145] above), the Crown submitted that the approach adopted by his Honour indicated a marginal allowance only at best. 

215The Crown submitted that the correct approach was to increase the sentence imposed for Count 5, to take into account the additional need for deterrence and retribution in respect of the offence in Count 5 for which the Respondent was to be sentenced, and that this had not occurred in the present case. 

Submissions of the Respondent

216Senior counsel for the Respondent submitted that the sentencing Judge had determined that the Form 1 matters were to impinge upon sentence for Count 5 to some extent. In this way, it was submitted that his Honour had not erred in the approach to the Form 1 matters, and that a greater sentence was imposed for Count 5 in a manner which indicated compliance with principle.

217Mr Odgers SC submitted that the Respondent's offences were part of one course of conduct committed by an offender suffering from a mental disorder, so that rehabilitation was a substantial factor on sentence. He submitted that it is difficult to see that there was a greater need for retribution or deterrence by reference to the Form 1 offences to be taken into account on sentence for Count 5.

Decision

218In the course of submissions, the Court drew attention to his Honour's statement that ""by clearing the slate in this way, as it was described he has provided considerable utility which must be brought to account to the offender"" (see [145] above). Senior counsel for the Respondent acknowledged that this observation of the sentencing Judge did not accord with principle, but he contended that his Honour's overall approach to the Form 1 matters did not demonstrate error. 

219It appears that his Honour's approach to the Form 1 matters involved a type of double counting in favour of the Respondent. It is no doubt correct that the Form 1 procedure involves a type of clearing the slate by an offender. In this way, an offender obtains an advantage in that there is a cap upon the available sentence confined to the primary offence, in relation to which the Form 1 matters are to be taken into account. However, it is erroneous to, in some way, seek to afford a further benefit to an offender because he or she has co-operated in such a process. To the extent that his Honour's words indicate that such an approach was taken, it was erroneous. 

220The more fundamental difficulty with respect to the Form 1 matters, however, is that the sentence fixed by his Honour for Count 5 does not, when viewed objectively, appear to make any (or any adequate) allowance for the Form 1 offences. These were significant offences involving a substantial sum of money. The proper exercise of sentencing discretion called for an appreciable increase in sentence on Count 5, to take into account the additional need for deterrence and retribution arising from the Form 1 matters: Abbas v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. 

221I would uphold the second ground of appeal. 

Ground 3 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Giving the Respondent's Subjective Case Greater Weight than was Warranted Such that it Impermissibly Ameliorated the Sentences Imposed

Ground 4 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Giving Greater Weight than was Warranted to Rehabilitation Thus Diminishing the Importance of Punishment and Denunciation

222The parties addressed these grounds of appeal together and it is appropriate for this Court to consider them in the same way. 

Submissions of the Crown

223The Crown noted the evidence adduced in the Respondent's case at first instance, which did not include evidence from the Respondent himself.

224It was submitted that it was significant that none of the character witnesses knew the true extent of the Respondent's criminal conduct, or that it went beyond monies obtained for a real estate purchase. 

225The Crown referred to the psychiatric reports which included diagnoses referred to earlier in this judgment. Dr Furst opined that the Respondent was likely to have been experiencing mood instability at the time of the offences, which he noted were motivated by the Respondent's need to purchase a Mosman property and fears that he might lose the property and deposit if he could not complete the purchase. Dr Furst had concluded that the Respondent was aware of his actions at the time, but that his judgment was probably poor. Further, although the Respondent told Dr Westmore that his mood was elevated and he felt invincible at the time of offending, he acknowledged, as well, that he was conscious of the decisions he was making at the time, although he reported some reduction in the clarity of his decision-making process.

226The Crown observed that the sentencing Judge appears to have regarded the psychiatric evidence as having very considerable weight. It was submitted, however, that his Honour had overlooked the fact that none of the witnesses, lay or expert, had been aware of the true extent of the Respondent's criminality. He had not told the character referees of the true extent of his offending. Nor had he provided a complete account of his offending to the psychiatrists. 

227It was submitted that the unsatisfactory features of the history given by the Respondent to each of the psychiatrists was plainly a relevant factor to consider when determining the weight to be given to the opinions of each of them. In circumstances where the Respondent had been untruthful with his friends and the medical practitioners, this should have operated to undermine the weight to be given to this evidence. Not only had the Respondent not given evidence himself foundational to the opinions of the psychiatrists, but he had positively misled the experts when describing his crimes.

228Rather than adopting a cautious approach, however, the Crown submitted that his Honour embraced the psychiatric evidence as impressive, relying upon it as evidence of an extraordinary degree of rehabilitation, as evidence of contrition and as evidence justifying a refusal to curtail the Respondent's rehabilitation progress by imposing a full-time custodial sentence.

229It was submitted that the Respondent's consistent understatement of his criminality pointed to a lack of contrition and remorse and that, in addition, the sentencing Judge had overlooked or ignored evidence in which the Respondent sought to apportion blame to others (an accountant or company financial controller).

230The Crown noted that counsel for the Respondent had advanced a submission that he could put it no higher than a possibility that there was a causal link between the bipolar disorder and the offences. In effect, the Crown submitted that this was a correct characterisation of the evidence in the circumstances of the present case.

231It was submitted that his Honour had taken an unduly favourable and erroneous approach in applying the principles in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa. 

232The Crown submitted that the psychiatric evidence, taken at its highest, ought not to have led to a finding of significantly reduced culpability on the part of the Respondent.

233In approaching the evidence concerning the Respondent's rehabilitation in the way in which he did, the Crown submitted that his Honour not only overstated the evidence, but allowed its significance to wrongly outweigh the other purposes which a sentence is intended to fulfil for the purpose of s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

234The Crown submitted that the Respondent's subjective case was wrongly given such weight by the sentencing Judge as to lead to the imposition of a sentence which was erroneous in its leniency, both in terms of the length of the individual sentences, the degree of concurrency, and the manner in which the sentence was to be served. 

Submissions of the Respondent

235Mr Odgers SC submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to make the findings which he did. Emphasis was placed upon the fact that Dr Furst had given oral evidence, and was cross-examined by the Crown. 

236It was submitted that the Crown did not join issue with a finding that the Respondent suffered from bipolar disorder. In reality, it was submitted that the Crown sought to challenge only the weight which his Honour chose to give to this factor on sentence. In this way, it was submitted that the finding was open to the sentencing Judge and that the grounds of appeal which contended to the contrary should fail.

Decision

237The present case provides a good illustration of the importance of the principle referred to in R v Qutami, and in other cases such as R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [39]-[41]. 

238Reports of psychiatrists and psychologists are tendered frequently in sentencing proceedings without controversy. Applying the principles in R v Qutami and R v Palu, sentencing courts will be cautious in attaching weight to untested histories provided to the authors of such reports, particularly in areas of controversy. 

239In the present case, there was a live controversy concerning the existence of any causal connection between a mental condition which may have affected the Respondent and his extended course of dishonest conduct over a period of a year. At the time of the offences, of course, the Respondent was functioning in a responsible business position. He had occupied a position of this type, apparently with some success, for several years. The character witnesses did not support an evidence-based finding of any apparent difference in his conduct or demeanour in 2007 and 2008, as opposed to other periods. 

240It was entirely clear to the Respondent's legal representatives, and the sentencing Judge, that the Crown was maintaining a submission that the absence of evidence from the Respondent at the sentencing hearing, was a significant factor in itself operating against findings in his favour, as to which he bore the onus to the civil standard.

241The process whereby Dr Furst was called to give evidence in fact missed the point. It was for the sentencing Judge to determine whether he was satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the matters which may operate in the Respondent's favour on sentence. The fact that Dr Furst may express an opinion, based upon what he was told in an untested way by the Respondent, did not advance the position. Nor did cross-examination of Dr Furst on these matters.

242The entire process was, in reality, one step removed from the true process required for the Respondent to agitate for findings to be made in his favour. In the circumstances of this case, it was clear that it was necessary for the Respondent to give evidence with respect to these matters. He did not do so. There was ample opportunity for the Respondent to give evidence on one of the several occasions when the matter came before his Honour. Although it was the Respondent's right to decline to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, a consequence of such a decision is that favourable findings which he seeks to have made to reduce sentence may not be available to a sentencing court, acting in accordance with the law and by reference to the evidence.

243The Respondent's decision not to give evidence was relevant, as well, to the question of what was done with the funds defrauded by him over a period of 12 months. For reasons considered under Ground 1, findings favourable to the Respondent were made in the absence of evidence from the Respondent, and based upon a misunderstanding of the true factual position.

244This Court has observed that the failure of a Judge to attribute sufficient weight to an issue at sentence will not generally be a material error. The circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40].

245I am satisfied, however, that the error in this case arises from the flawed approach adopted by the sentencing Judge. His Honour has disregarded evidence of significance and has failed to have regard to the absence of evidence from the Respondent, in circumstances where a submission had been made by the Crown that the absence of such evidence was of great significance in the resolution of issues in the proceedings. It should be observed, in any event, that the Respondent had told Dr Westmore and Dr Furst that he was conscious of the decisions he was making, and their wrongness, at the time of the offences (see [225] above). What the Respondent said to the psychiatrists was not of substantial assistance to him on sentence in any event.

246A consequence of this erroneous approach is that findings were made which were not supported by the evidence. In particular, a finding of the existence of a causal connection between the Respondent's offences and his mental condition was erroneous. 

247There was evidence of the Respondent's mental health in and after 2009 which could be taken into account as a subjective factor on sentence. However, the sentencing Judge erred in approaching this evidence in the way in which he did.

248I am satisfied that these grounds of appeal have been established. 

Ground 5 - The Sentencing Judge Erred by Failing to Impose Sentences that Reflected the Objective Gravity of the Crimes

Ground 6 - The Sentencing Judge Erred in Ordering that the Sentences be Served by Way of ICOs

249These grounds of appeal were argued together by counsel and will be considered together by the Court.

Submissions of the Crown

250Drawing upon a number of submissions advanced in support of earlier grounds, the Crown submitted that the objective gravity of these offences was such that only a full-time custodial sentence could have addressed the criminality involved, and remained reasonably proportionate to the circumstances of the crimes.

251It was submitted that the offending was serious, extended in time, deliberate and extremely dishonest. The offences taken into account on the Form 1 with respect to Count 5 were of such seriousness that there should have been an appreciable and significant increase in penalty for the offence. The motivation was solely that of personal financial gain.

252The Crown submitted that the Respondent's offences included the acquisition of an expensive Mosman property. 

253It was submitted that a course of criminality of this type committed by a person in a position of trust (as a director and as a company secretary), unameliorated by restitution or genuine remorse, had to be met with a significant custodial sentence to have an appropriate punitive and deterrent effect, both upon the Respondent and others who might be tempted to act dishonestly in this way. The Crown emphasised the importance, in a commercial environment, of company office holders justifying the trust that reposes in them and upon which the foundation for contemporary business and investment practice rests.

254It was submitted that the fixing of erroneous sentences was compounded by an order permitting each of the sentences to be served by way of an ICO. The Crown noted that counsel for the Respondent had (realistically) raised this sentencing option as a ""slim possibility"", with the sentencing Judge then adopting that prospect with some enthusiasm. The Crown pointed to authorities which state that an ICO has inherent in it a significant degree of leniency, involving no actual custody. Correctly assessed, the Crown submitted that the circumstances of the Respondent's crimes, and of his subjective case, were inconsistent with the leniency inherent in an ICO. 

255It was submitted that a sentence of two years' duration, taken with the use of an ICO, did not meet the purposes of sentencing in this case, so that error has been demonstrated as contended for in these grounds.

Submissions of the Respondent

256Mr Odgers SC submitted that reasonable proportionality between the offences and sentences required attention to be had to not only the objective circumstances, but also the subjective circumstances of the Respondent. It was submitted that his Honour had complied with this approach in this case. 

257The sentencing Judge accepted that the only appropriate sentence was one of imprisonment. However, in light of all the circumstances, his Honour concluded that an overall sentence of two years' imprisonment was within the range of sentences open in this case.

258Senior counsel for the Respondent observed that the imposition of an ICO is available to white-collar offenders, noting what had been said concerning rehabilitation in R v Pogson at 83-85 [100]-[113].

Decision

259This is not a case of an isolated offence committed by an offender with an established mental condition bearing directly upon the commission of the offence. Rather, over the period of a year, the Respondent defrauded the corporate victim on several occasions, with him or his own company obtaining the benefit of about $1.5 million as a result. The offences involved acts of deception by the Respondent which were intended to guard against detection. 

260A number of factors operated in the Respondent's favour subjectively on sentence. However, it was necessary for sentences to be imposed to adequately punish the Respondent for his offences, whilst at the same time fulfilling the functions of general and specific deterrence, and the other purposes of sentencing, including rehabilitation: s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

261I am satisfied that error has been demonstrated in the circumstances of this case, both in determining that the sentences for the totality of the Respondent's crimes could be accommodated within a term of two years' imprisonment, and then ordering that the sentence be performed by way of an ICO.

262I am satisfied that these grounds of appeal have been made good.

Ground 7 - The Sentences Imposed Were Manifestly Inadequate

Submissions of the Crown

263The Crown referred to the submissions made in support of earlier grounds of appeal which, it was contended, were made good individually and which, when viewed together, serve to explain how manifestly inadequate sentences had been imposed.

264Whilst acknowledging the demands of the test of manifest inadequacy, it was submitted that it had been demonstrated in this case. 

265It was submitted that the Respondent's crimes were of considerable seriousness which were not isolated transactions, but covered a period of a year. Further, the Respondent's subjective case, whilst positive, was by no means extraordinary or exceptional. A strong element of general deterrence was necessary, notwithstanding the Respondent's mental condition. Reasonable proportionality is required between the sentences to be imposed and the circumstances of the crimes.

266The Crown submitted that it was necessary for a full-time custodial sentence of some significance to have been imposed, and that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.

Submissions of the Respondent

267Mr Odgers SC submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were outside the range of sentences open to the Court in the exercise of sentencing discretion: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 539 [60].

268It was submitted that the sentences imposed lay within the available range of sentence. The Court was taken to a number of sentencing decisions referred to in the decision of this Court in Stratford v R [2007] NSWCCA 279 at [31]ff, which were said to support this submission.

269Whilst acknowledging the leniency of the sentences imposed, it was submitted that the sentences were not manifestly inadequate.

Decision

270To make good this ground of appeal, it is necessary for the Crown to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. 

271Each of the offences for which the Respondent was to be sentenced was punishable by imprisonment for 10 years. Proper regard was to be given to the Form 1 offences in passing sentence for Count 5. 

272These offences were objectively grave. This was demonstrated by the amount of money involved, the length of time over which the offences were committed, the Respondent's motive of financial gain, the level of planning involved (including false entries to disguise the conduct) and the very significant breach of trust involved by the Respondent, as both a company director and company secretary. 

273The Respondent's effective prior good character was to be taken into account in his favour, although good character is of lesser significance on sentence for white-collar crime involving officers of a company: cf R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315; 152 A Crim R 548 at 579 [60]-[61], Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24; 219 A Crim R 237 at 298 [272]. 

274The psychiatric evidence concerning the Respondent pointed to the existence of a mental condition which is relevant on the question of sentence. However, for reasons expressed earlier in this judgment, this evidence was of limited use on sentence. Further, general deterrence remained a very significant factor on sentence for this class of offending, even where there was evidence of a mental condition affecting the Respondent at the time of the offences. Of relevance are recent statements of this Court in R v Donald [2013] NSWCCA 238 (an offence of dishonestly using one's position as an employee of a corporation with intention to obtain an advantage), where Latham J (Hidden and Adamson JJ agreeing) said at [76]:

""I have no difficulty accepting that the respondent's bipolar disorder compromised his ability on occasions to control his faculties and emotions, but I do not accept, given the nature of his offending, that he was unable to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments. In those circumstances, the respondent's moral culpability for his offending was, in my view, moderately reduced. There was still a significant role for general deterrence to play, particularly where serious breaches of trust and dishonest trading in the market were concerned: Hartman v R [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [79], [91] and [92]; R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330.""

275It is notable that, unlike the present Respondent, Mr Donald had given evidence in his sentencing proceedings.

276In the same case, Latham J said at [86]:

""It has also been repeatedly observed that the real bite of general deterrence takes hold only when a custodial sentence is imposed: R v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 per Whealy J at [51]; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, per Howie J at [32]. Notwithstanding judicial statements to the effect that a suspended sentence is a sentence of imprisonment, the community (including those in 'white collar' occupations) might be justifiably forgiven for thinking that an offender who is serving a bond in the community has escaped meaningful punishment.""

277Considerations of this type have application to the present case. 

278This Court has emphasised, as well, the significant degree of leniency involved in the use of an ICO as a sentence. Although statements made in R v Pogson (in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and myself) point to the breadth of the concept of rehabilitation, and the capacity of an ICO to operate as a form of punishment, it is necessary not to lose sight of the need for an appropriate level of punishment, in the form of immediate incarceration, in cases such as the present. Even in R v Pogson, it was found that the use of an ICO was manifestly inadequate, although the Crown appeals were dismissed on discretionary grounds.

279The decision in R v Pogson should not be utilised to pass an entirely inappropriate sentence, which sees an offender such as the Respondent, with his magnitude of offending, being dealt with by way of an ICO. The purposes of punishment require imprisonment by way of full-time imprisonment and not an ICO, in cases of significant white-collar crime: R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [73]-[76].

280I do not think that the sentencing decisions referred to in Stratford v R to which the Court was taken, provide any assistance to the Respondent in this case. 

281The explanation for the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences in this case may be found largely in the various errors identified in the first six grounds of appeal. The succinct statement of Wood CJ at CL (Giles JA and Levine J agreeing) in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335 at [34]-[35] has application to this case:

""34 Clearly it was necessary and appropriate for his Honour to take the subjective matters into account, but they had to be kept in perspective. They should not have become the reason for imposing a sentence which, in my view, was weakly merciful and which did not properly reflect the objectives of punishment, retribution and deterrence, both general and personal. 

35 The result, so it seems to me, was to produce a sentence - whether suspended or not - that was not reasonably proportionate to the crime. Rather, it was of the kind which offends the principles enunciated in decisions such as Regina v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 and the earlier decision in Regina v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594.""

282I am satisfied that Ground 7 has been made good.

The Residual Discretion and Resentencing

Submissions of the Parties

283If error was demonstrated, Mr Odgers SC submitted that the Court should dismiss the Crown appeal in the exercise of the residual discretion available to the Court. 

284He submitted that the conduct of the Crown in preparing an ambiguous statement of facts, and in contributing to the sentencing Judge's misunderstanding of the facts on 31 May 2013, bore upon the exercise of discretion. 

285He submitted, as well, that allowing the appeal would occasion injustice to the Respondent, whose progress in rehabilitation ought be taken into account, as well as the risk that imprisonment would derail that progress.

286In this respect, Mr Odgers SC relied upon statements in R v Kong [2013] SASCFC 15; 115 SASR 425 at [102] concerning the Respondent's personal circumstances, his progress towards rehabilitation, the harshness of sentencing a person to custody who has been free in the community and has taken significant steps to rebuilding his life, as being factors relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion.

287An affidavit of the Respondent sworn 18 November 2013 was read, together with two affidavits of John Pearson, the Respondent's solicitor, affirmed on 22 and 27 November 2013 respectively. The first affidavit annexed a report dated 7 November 2013 of Ms Emma-Jane Barclay, the Respondent's treating psychologist which addressed his progress and the risks if he should go into custody. That affidavit confirmed, as well, that the Respondent had been complying with the conditions of his ICO. 

288The second affidavit annexed a further report dated 26 November 2013 of Dr Furst concerning the Respondent's current psychiatric condition. Dr Furst noted that the Respondent had managed to secure employment this year and had maintained his relationship with his partner, whilst being engaged in a work program as part of his ICO and living independently. Dr Furst expressed the opinion that the Respondent would be vulnerable in a prison setting if not medicated, and he suggested that a trial of Lithium be used in the future, especially if his mood deteriorates.

289The Crown submitted that application of correct sentencing principles, in light of the Respondent's crimes and taking into account his subjective circumstances, should not lead the Court to decline to intervene on discretionary grounds. It was submitted that the circumstances in which the sentencing Judge came to misunderstand the facts and the Respondent's non-intervention to correct the position on 31 May 2013, were also relevant in consideration of the exercise of the residual discretion in this case.

Decision

290It has been said that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons, so that this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s.5D, has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24-25 [92], [95], 33 [150].

291In determining whether or not the discretion should be exercised, it is open to the Court to receive evidence of what has happened between the time of sentence and the hearing of the appeal: R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175 at 195 [129].

292There is no doubt that the conduct of the Crown in the District Court may, depending upon the circumstances, be relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. It is necessary, however, to consider what has happened in the case at hand. In the present case, the sentencing Judge raised on the last hearing day, issues concerning the facts of the case. The issues raised were of some complexity. The Crown representative present on that occasion was a solicitor expecting to take judgment, who had not prepared for questions of this type, asked as they were without notice. Doing the best he could, the Crown representative sought to assist the Court, involving acceptance of certain misunderstandings advanced by the sentencing Judge. His Honour did not direct any questions on these issues to counsel for the Respondent, who had been present throughout the proceedings. Nor did counsel for the Respondent rise to make any contribution on the topic.

293There was clear error on the part of the sentencing Judge, involving a misunderstanding of the facts. This led his Honour to adopt a view of the facts which had not been advanced on behalf of the Respondent at the lengthy sentencing hearing, and which was not supported by the evidence. 

294In these circumstances, I do not consider that this Court should decline to intervene. The sentencing process at first instance was marked by clear error, leading to the imposition of an unreasonable or plainly unjust sentence. The interests of justice require the imposition of appropriate sentences for these serious crimes: R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at 587 [79].

295As to the balance of the submissions advanced in support of the exercise of the residual discretion, it is regrettable that the Respondent has been placed in his present position by the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. It may be inferred from the approach of the Respondent's counsel that he had formed the accurate view that there was no realistic prospect of the use of an ICO (see [119] above). Likewise, counsel was careful not to overstate the use that could be made of the psychiatric evidence and any connection to the criminal conduct (see [121] above).

296It was the approach of the sentencing Judge which culminated in the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences by way of an ICO. A number of errors were made along the way to reach this point. A consequence of this is that the Respondent was given false hope concerning this appeal. 

297In R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594, Street CJ (Lee and Slattery JJ agreeing) observed at 597 that it is ""cool reason, not passion or generosity"" that must characterise sentencing. In the same case, Street CJ adopted (at 597-598) a passage from the judgment of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v Radich [1954] NZLR 86 at 87, where it was said:

""If a Court is weakly merciful, and does not impose a sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, it fails in its duty to see that the sentences are such as to operate as a powerful factor to prevent the commission of such offences.""

298Considerations of this type arose in R v McGourty, to which reference has been made (see [281] above).

299I am satisfied that the Court should not dismiss the Crown appeal in the exercise of discretion. In sentencing the Respondent, I take into account the objective gravity of these offences, and the Respondent's subjective case, which is substantial, but not exceptional. Regard must be had, in particular, to general deterrence. Serious offences of this type committed by company directors call for significant sentences: R v Giam (No. 2) [1999] NSWCCA 378; 109 A Crim R 348 at 353 [27]; R v Williams at 576-578 [44]-[48].

300In resentencing the Respondent, it is appropriate to apply the 12.5% discount for the Respondent's pleas of guilty. 

301Individual sentences ought be fixed for each offence, with a level of partial accumulation, keeping in mind the totality principle. The aggregation of all sentences should constitute a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved: R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 164 [15]. 

302Fixed terms are appropriate on Counts 1-4, with a non-parole period to be set as part of the sentence on Count 5.

303A finding of special circumstances will be made on Count 5 having regard, in particular, to the Respondent's health issues and the need for an appropriate period of conditional liberty to assist his return to the community upon release. The effective non-parole period represents the minimum period the Respondent should serve in custody for all his offences, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing.

304The sentences should date from 21 June 2013, when the Respondent commenced the sentences which he has been serving by way of an ICO. This approach accords with that conventionally taken by this Court in circumstances such as this, so that time served in this way counts as part of the sentence imposed by this Court: R v Tannous [2012] NSWCCA 243 at [88]-[90].

305The sentences to be imposed will involve an effective non-parole period of two years and three months (from 21 June 2013) with a balance of term of one year and nine months.

306I propose the following orders:

(a)Crown appeal allowed.

(b)Sentences imposed upon the Respondent in the District Court on 14 June 2013 are quashed.

(c)In lieu thereof, the Respondent is sentenced as follows:

(i)for Count 1, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 21 June 2013 and expiring on 20 June 2014,

(ii)on Count 2, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 21 September 2013 and expiring on 20 September 2014,

(iii)for Count 3, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 21 December 2013 and expiring on 20 December 2014,

(iv)for Count 4, the Respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing on 21 December 2013 and expiring on 20 December 2014,

(v)for Count 5, and taking into account the seven offences on the Form 1, the Respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of one year and six months to date from 21 March 2014 and to expire on 20 September 2015, with a balance of term of one year and six months commencing on 21 September 2015 and expiring on 20 March 2017.

(d)The earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release to parole is 21 September 2015.

(e)I recommend that the psychiatric report of Dr Richard Furst dated 26 November 2013, together with the psychological report of Ms Emma-Jane Barclay dated 7 November 2013 be furnished to relevant authorities within Justice Health and the Department of Corrective Services, to assist the treatment and classification of the Respondent in custody.

307HALL J: I agree with Johnson J.

		07 January 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763056,Peters v R [2013] NSWCCA 324,"Judgment

1LATHAM J : The applicant, Paul Douglas Peters, seeks leave to appeal against the asserted severity of a sentence imposed upon him by Zahra SC DCJ on 20 November 2012 for the offence of aggravated break, enter and detain for advantage, pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, to which the applicant pleaded guilty on 8 March 2012 in the Local Court.

2The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. The applicant received a non- parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months.

3There are seven grounds of appeal. The first three grounds allege error on the judge's part in his treatment of the applicant's psychiatric condition and its relevance to the sentencing exercise. The fourth ground of appeal alleges error in the judge's approach to the application of the standard non- parole period. The fifth ground alleges error in failing to make a finding regarding the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. The sixth ground takes issue with the failure to make a finding of special circumstances and the last ground alleges manifest excess.

The Offence

4The applicant was sentenced on the basis of agreed facts. It is necessary to set out those facts in some detail in order to appreciate the context of his Honour's findings in relation to the applicant's psychiatric condition.

5On 3 August 2011, the victim who was studying for her Higher School Certificate trial examinations, was in her bedroom in her family home at Mosman. At about 2:15 pm, the applicant entered the home through a closed but unlocked front door. At the time he was in possession of a baseball bat and a small backpack. He was wearing a multicoloured balaclava which concealed his face.

6The applicant entered the victim's bedroom, saying ""I'm not going to hurt you"". The victim stood up from her desk, retreated towards her bed and asked the applicant ""What do you want? What are you doing?"" The applicant told the victim to sit down and that ""no one needs to get hurt"". The victim sat down on her bed, whereupon the applicant placed the baseball bat and the backpack on the bed next to her. He removed a black box from the backpack and pushed it against the victim's throat, securing it around her neck with a bicycle lock which was attached to the box.

7The victim asked the applicant what he was doing and he told her he would tell her in a minute. The applicant locked the bicycle lock, fixing the black box around the victim's neck. He then placed a purple lanyard around the victim's neck which had a USB stick, and a plastic document sleeve attached to it. The plastic document sleeve contained a two-page typed document. A label with a typed e-mail address was affixed to the box.

8The applicant started to walk away and the victim asked him where he was going. The applicant replied ""Count to 200 ... I'll be back ... If you move I can see you, I'll be right here"". The applicant then left the room taking the baseball bat and backpack with him. The applicant was in the physical presence of the victim for a matter of minutes.

9The victim was extremely frightened and sat on her bed as instructed for a short time, believing that the applicant was elsewhere in the house. After a few minutes she yelled out but there was no response. Using her mobile telephone she sent text messages to her mother and her father asking for police to be called. The victim left her bedroom, and removed the two-page typed document from the plastic sleeve around her neck.

10The victim read a portion of one of the pages and saw a reference to ""explosive"". She immediately believed that a bomb had been placed around her neck. She again yelled out, but heard no response. The victim then called her father and asked him to ring police. The victim returned to her room and continued reading the document and saw that it contained instructions not to alert the authorities. The victim called her father back and told him not to contact police, however the police had already been notified. Police arrived soon after and entered the house. They found the victim in an hysterical state and crying uncontrollably.

11The two-page document within the plastic sleeve read as follows :-

12The victim gave the police a description of the applicant. Specialist police and bomb disposal officers arrived. Shortly after 6 pm in the presence of police, the victim's father sent an e-mail to the e-mail address contained in the note. The message read ""Hi my name is Bill. I am the father of the girl you strapped the device to. What do you want me to do next? Bill""

13On three occasions that afternoon the applicant accessed the e-mail address but did not respond. For a number of hours the victim remained near her bedroom in the company of a police officer who facilitated the examination of the black box by police bomb technicians using photographic and x-ray equipment. The specialist officers confirmed that the device contained mechanical and electrical components. Examination of the device continued until about 11 pm when bomb disposal officers were able to confirm that there were no explosives in the black box. The box was removed from the victim's neck at around midnight. By that time, the device had been affixed to the victim for approximately ten hours.

14During the time the device was around the victim's neck, she was required to support the box by holding it with her hands in case the box contained explosives. During this period of time, the victim was crying and scared for her life. She was conveyed to hospital for examination.

15The device was further examined after it was removed from the victim. It was found to be a portable gun safe. The gun safe had been altered by drilling holes in the cover and feeding the cable of a bicycle lock through the holes.

16Police carried out enquiries with the Internet service provider to ascertain whether there had been access to the e-mail account. The provider informed police that the e-mail account was created on 30 May 2011 from an IP address linked to O'Hare airport, Chicago, Illinois, USA. The provider informed police that the account had been accessed on three occasions and that all three occasions occurred on the afternoon of 3 August 2011 about three hours after the applicant entered the victim's house. The account was accessed at 4:09 pm at Kincumber library and at 5:25 pm and 5:51 pm at an Avoca video store.

17Police attended Kincumber library and viewed CCTV footage from the library and car park. The footage showed a gold coloured Range Rover drive into the car park of the library at a time shortly before the e-mail account was accessed. The footage also showed a male enter the library wearing clothing consistent with the victim's description of the clothing worn by the person who entered the house.

18Police conducted enquiries of the RTA in relation to the motor vehicle. Those enquiries identified the applicant as a person who physically resembled the male depicted in the CCTV footage recorded at the library. CCTV footage from a liquor shop adjacent to the Avoca video store also depicted a male consistent with the appearance of the applicant entering the Avoca video store at 5:24 pm and 5:49 pm on 3 August 2011. Further enquiries revealed that the applicant departed Sydney on a United Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles, USA on 8 August 2011. The applicant then flew to Louisville, Kentucky.

19Further enquiries of the airline revealed that the applicant arrived in Sydney on 1 June 2011 having been on a connecting flight that departed O'Hare airport, Chicago on 30 May 2011.

20On 15 August 2011, FBI Federal agents in Louisville Kentucky arrested the applicant. He was taken to an FBI agency, cautioned and agreed to participate in an interview with Australian police. The applicant made a number of admissions to being on the street of the victim's home on the day of the offence. He admitted creating the e-mail address and purchasing various items, however he denied being responsible for placing the hoax bomb around the victim's neck.

21During the interview, the applicant told police that he had flown into Australia nine weeks beforehand in order to finish a book that he was writing. He said that he left after he had printed off the manuscript. He told police he had been working on the book continuously for the previous four months and that he had finished the novel on 2, 3 or 4 August. The applicant's credit card demonstrated that on 4 August 2011 an amount of $45.71 was used to pay for photocopying and binding at a stationary store.

22The applicant admitted that he had set up the e-mail account at O'Hare airport on his way to Australia. He said he had set up the account as a backup e-mail address for his Hong Kong novel but he did not give the e-mail address to anyone as he did not need to use it. He said that he chose the name ""Dirk Straun"" as his novel is ""very sort of the next generation .... And you know it's a name you don't forget"".

23The applicant told police that many years ago he had read the James Clavell novel ""Taipan"" in which Dirk Straun is the protagonist. He said that he was following the media coverage of the incident in Mosman on a Sydney newspaper online site. He said on 12 August after he arrived in the United States he purchased the novel. FBI agents found a copy of ""Taipan"" during the execution of a search warrant at the home of the applicant's ex-wife where he was living at the time of his arrest.

24The applicant told police that he had accessed the e-mail account at Sydney University in the first few weeks of arriving in Australia and then once at a library in Gosford. He was asked whether he had accessed it at any other time and he said that he had not. 

25The applicant admitted that he had purchased a gun safe about a week before he went to Australia. He said that he did not create a code for the gun safe. He said that he bought a flexible bike chain and had a friend, the name of whom he provided to police, drill holes into it so he could fix the chain to the safe, so he could attach the safe to something. That person provided a statement to police in which he confirmed that he altered a gun safe for the applicant on a weekend in June 2011. The applicant told that person that he wanted the box altered so that he could store travel documents and passports in it. The witness was shown photos of the device affixed to the victim and identified the item depicted as the same model gun safe that the applicant had asked him to alter. He said the label with the ""Dirk Straun"" e-mail address was not affixed to the box.

26In the course of the interview, the applicant said that the altered gun safe with a label affixed to it and containing details of his bank account numbers was stolen from his address in Copacabana about two weeks before the offence. He told police that he did not report the theft and nothing else was stolen. When shown the two-page document that was left with the victim that directed contact with the ""Dirk Straun"" e-mail address, the applicant said he had not seen it before.

27The applicant admitted that he had been in Mosman at around 1:30 pm on 3 August 2011. He told police that he had been going there for a week to 10 days prior to 3 August to undertake research for his writing. The applicant said that when he was in the street of the victim's home on 3 August 2011 he saw a male who lived next door to the victim. The applicant said he knew that male from when he, the applicant, resided in Hong Kong. He told police that he waved to this man who was in his car with his wife. The applicant said that he also saw the same man again outside the Commonwealth Bank in Mosman on 3 August 2011. He also told police that he saw the male probably a week before 3 August 2011 and he had a conversation with him outside his house.

28In a statement later taken from the male neighbour nominated by the applicant, the neighbour confirmed that he had spoken to a male outside his house on the Friday prior to the offence. The neighbour told police that the male said that he knew him from a previous business association in Hong Kong. At the time of the conversation, the neighbour was collecting his garbage bin from the street. That neighbour's residence is near the victim's home.

29In the interview, the applicant told police that after he left Mosman on the afternoon of 3 August 2011, he drove home in his Range Rover. He had earlier admitted that he owned a metallic gold Range Rover. He was asked if he went anywhere before he went home and he said he did not. He was asked whether he was sure that was the case and he responded ""absolutely"".

30Stills from the CCTV footage from Kincumber library were shown to the applicant by police and he was informed that at the time that the CCTV images were taken, the ""Dirk Straun"" e-mail address was accessed from a computer at Kincumber library. The applicant admitted that he was the person depicted in the images and that he accessed the e-mail account at that time.

31The applicant was also shown stills from CCTV footage from the liquor store in Avoca Beach on the evening of 3 August 2011. He agreed that he was also depicted in those images. When asked if he went anywhere else the applicant said that amongst other places he went to a video store. He said that he went to the video store twice to log into a computer to see if he had any messages or documents on his e-mail account.

32Bank records demonstrated that the credit card account of the applicant was used in the Gosford stationery store on 4 July to purchase a purple lanyard and the USB device of the same colour and brand as that placed around the victim's neck. The applicant said that he purchased the USB to store his novel manuscript and to store other material. He denied putting anything else on the USB. When asked where the USB then was, he said that he assumed the USB would be at his place.

33Forensic examination of the USB stick recovered three deleted files, one of which contained a Word file which was a letter of demand in the same terms as the saved file and hardcopy document in the plastic sleeve placed around the victim's neck. That file also directed the recipient to contact the ""Dirk Straun"" e-mail address. Forensic analysis of the Word format revealed that it was registered to a computer with the identification ""Paul P"". In his record of interview with police, the applicant could not explain why the deleted file on the USB that was found with the victim was registered to a ""Paul P"" and claimed that everything was ""a horrible, horrible coincidence.""

34One of the three deleted files on the USB contained a similar letter of demand, and was addressed to the trustee of the James M Cox Trust Estate. The applicant told police that he had property to the value of US$12 million tied up in a trust which was the subject of dispute. He told the police that the name of the trust was ""the James M Cox Trust"". When shown a copy of that deleted document, the applicant declined to further comment.

35The credit card account of PD Peters was used to purchase a rainbow coloured balaclava on 16 July 2011 at a clothing store at Erina Fair. Enquiries of that store revealed that the purchase was for a multicoloured horizontal striped balaclava, consistent with that described by the victim. The applicant said he was not aware of any purchase of a multicoloured balaclava.

36The credit card account of PD Peters was also used to purchase a baseball bat at a sports store at Erina Fair on 16 July 2011 shortly before the purchase of the balaclava. CCTV footage from Erina Fair centre and the sports store depicted the applicant purchasing a black baseball bat. The applicant told police he had purchased a baseball bat at the sports store to have at the house. When asked where the baseball bat was, the applicant said ""obviously you know, it's probably one of the things that was nicked"".

37The applicant was remanded in custody in the United States awaiting extradition proceedings. On 14 September 2011 the applicant waived his right to an extradition hearing and agreed to be returned to Australia in the custody of New South Wales police. He was taken to the Surry Hills Police Centre on 24 September 2011 where he was charged. He remained in custody from that date.

Ground 1 : Error in Concluding that the Applicant's Psychiatric Condition was not Causally Related to his Offending Conduct

Ground 2 : Error in Finding that the Applicant's Mental Condition ought not have any Significant Impact on Principles of General and Specific Deterrence.

Ground 3 : Error in :

(a)his Assessment of the Severity of the Applicant's Underlying Depression and Other Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder

(b)in Concluding that it was a Possibility that the Applicant's ""Stabilisation of Mood"" after Entering Custody may have been Attributable to the Cessation of Alcohol Use.


38The first three grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. The applicant does not allege error on the part of the judge with respect to his Honour's appreciation of the relevance of mental illness to the sentencing exercise. The judge referred to the principles expressed in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, Lauritsen v The Queen (2000) 22 WAR 442; 114 A Crim R 333, and Miller v The Queen [1999] WASCA 66. Rather, the applicant complains that the judge's conclusions, which he drew from the evidence and the application of those principles, were ""not reasonably open.""

39On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant's senior counsel foreshadowed a challenge to the authority of R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397 as the basis upon which this Court should determine grounds of appeal alleging error as to fact finding. In that case, Hunt J stressed the nature of the jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and confirmed that error in fact-finding is demonstrated ""if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself"" (at 401). The applicant submits that such a test is too narrow.

40In DPP v JG [2010] NSWCCA 222 ; 220 A Crim R 19 at [21] and again in Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 at [4], Basten JA queried the sufficiency of Hunt J's formulation of the test for factual errors in both conviction appeals and sentence appeals. The implied criticism of Hunt J's formulation is one of completeness, not that a different test ought to be substituted.

41Aoun was concerned with a relatively straightforward finding of fact concerning whether the offender had the capacity to actually supply a quantity of drugs. Johnson J's judgment (with whom Adams J agreed) on this issue was :-

33.This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. 

34 It is important to keep in mind the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court where a finding of a first-instance Judge is challenged on appeal. A frequently cited and applied statement of principle is that of Hunt J (Carruthers and Wood JJ agreeing) in R v O'Donoghue at 401: 
""It is important to emphasise that, unlike appeals to the Court of Appeal in civil cases, an appeal to this court is not by way of re-hearing. An appeal which is not by way of re-hearing is no more than the right to have a superior court interpose to redress the error of the court below: A-G v Sillem (1864) 10 HLC 704 at 724; 11 ER 1200 at 1209; Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 109. Error may be demonstrated if there is no evidence to support a particular finding, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself. But this court has no power to substitute its own findings for those of the trial judge. The members of this court may individually disagree with the findings which were made, but the court cannot for that reason interfere with those findings. It is only where the very narrow basis upon which this court can intervene in relation to a trial judge's findings of fact has been established that the conviction can be set aside, and then only if the error has led to a miscarriage of justice: see Regina v Merritt & Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 372-373; Regina v Kyriakou (1987) 29 A Crim R 50 at 60-61."" 

35 This statement has been applied in a multitude of cases, including sentence appeals where a finding of fact is challenged on appeal: R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 at [38]-[41]; R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [60]-[61]; Kardoulias v R [2005] NSWCCA 456; 159 A Crim R 252 at 265 [56]; Camm v R [2009] NSWCCA 141 at [68]-[70]; SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 198 A Crim R 219 at 335 [75]. 


42Ultimately, not only was O'Donoghue applied in Aoun itself and the cases that Johnson J noted, but it has since been applied in R v Choi [2010] NSWCCA 318 at [55] per R A Hulme J (Giles JA and Hislop J agreeing), Furia v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 326 at [35] per R A Hulme J (Giles JA and Hislop J agreeing), Michael v R [2011] NSWCCA 122 per Garling J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing) and WW v R [2012] NSWCCA 165 per Hoeben CJ at CL (Johnson and Button JJ agreeing).

43In my view, this argument is misplaced. The judge's ""findings"" on the issue of his psychiatric condition were not findings of fact such as those addressed in the cases referred to above. With the possible exception of ground 3(b), which takes issue with a qualified finding of fact (namely, the reason for the applicant's improvement after entering custody), these grounds essentially attack the exercise of the judge's sentencing discretion. As Gleeson CJ said in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, at 1, :-
Persons suffering from mental disorders frequently come into collision with the criminal justice system. Sentencing such persons commonly confronts judicial officers with the need to make sensitive discretionary decisions. Sentencing is essentially a discretionary exercise requiring consideration of the extremely variable facts and circumstances of individual cases and the application of those facts and circumstances to the principles laid down by statute or established by the common law.
... It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.


44Accordingly, the basis upon which the judge's exercise of the sentencing discretion with respect to the applicant's mental illness ought be examined is that established by House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 - 505. If it can be demonstrated that the judge acted upon a wrong principle, took into account an irrelevant consideration, failed to take into account a relevant consideration, or that his assessment was unreasonable or plainly unjust, the intervention of this Court may be warranted.

45In any event, the applicant's contention that the judge's findings on this issue were ""not reasonably open"" mirrors the basis of House v The King error. There is no need to re-visit the application of O'Donoghue in the circumstances of this case.

46It must first be acknowledged that the judge's reasons extend over 49 pages of careful and detailed analysis of the circumstances of the offence (pages 1 - 8), the applicant's account provided to three psychiatrists (pages 8 - 16), the clinical observations of the applicant's mental state by Justice Health and by Dr Westmore since his arrest (pages 16 - 18), the evidence of the applicant's estranged wife (pages 18 - 19), the various psychiatric opinions regarding the applicant's mental state at the time of offending (pages 20 - 23), the motive for the offending and its relationship to the psychiatric opinions (pages 25 - 35), whether the applicant's mental state operated to reduce the applicant's moral culpability (pages 36 - 41), an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence (pages 42 - 44), and the applicant's subjective case (pages 44 - 47).

47With respect to the first ground of appeal, the applicant points out that the psychiatric diagnoses of the applicant were consistent, insofar as it was generally agreed that the applicant suffered an alcohol abuse disorder and a bipolar II affective disorder including a major depressive disorder and mood changes. The applicant also noted on the hearing of the appeal that the essential difference in the diagnoses of Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore was one of degree. The applicant acknowledges that his Honour referred to this consistent psychiatric opinion.

48The finding which is said to underpin his Honour's error appears in the following passage :-

It has not been shown on the balance of probabilities that the offender's underlying mental disorders significantly impacted upon his judgment so as to reduce the moral culpability of the offender or is such that it would have any significant impact on ordinary principles of general deterrence. I am not satisfied that the underlying mental disorder affected his ability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions or to make reasonable judgments. The offender entered a house armed and disguised. He found the young girl on her own and vulnerable. At the time of placing the device he had prepared around the neck of the victim he would have appreciated the enormity of what he was doing and the terrible effect and consequence of his conduct upon the victim. He proceeded regardless. The underlying mental conditions do little to reduce the offender's moral culpability for such heinous acts.

49The applicant submits that, whilst no issue is taken with the rejection by the judge of the applicant's account of his offending to the various psychiatrists, nor with the judge's finding that the applicant's motive was the extortion of money, nonetheless the trial judge focused ""so closely"" on the applicant's un-creditworthy account that he ""failed to properly consider the powerful and unanimous evidence linking the offending conduct to the applicant's mental health problems.""

50That ""powerful and unanimous evidence"" derives from the evidence of Dr Westmore and Dr Phillips, the evidence of Ms Peters and objective features of the offence that are described in the applicant's submissions as ""bizarre"" and ""strange"".

51It is not necessary to recount the evidence to which the applicant refers for the purpose of dealing with this ground of appeal. There was no failure on the part of the trial judge to properly consider the evidence linking the offending conduct to the applicant's mental illness. The judge recounted that evidence in considerable detail in the course of his remarks on sentence. 

52The assessment of the relevance of the applicant's mental illness begins at p 24 of the judge's remarks. Over the following 17 pages, the judge undertook a painstaking analysis of the evidence relating to the applicant's account of his offending to the various psychiatrists, the applicant's record of interview with police, objective features of the offending and the various psychiatric opinions. That analysis resulted in :-

(1)a finding, based on the applicant's record of interview with police, that the applicant's cognitive functioning at the time of the interview was not significantly impaired. 

(2)a rejection of the applicant's case that his offending was designed to lead to his detection and treatment and that the applicant's behaviour related to the offending was ""clumsy and amateurish"".

(3)a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant set in train a plan to extort money, that the offending involved significant planning over a period of time, and that the terms of the document were clearly of an extortionist nature designed to place the victim in substantial fear that she would be killed if the demand was not met. 

(4)a finding that the offending was not the product of a psychotic state or the consequence of the offender assuming a character in his book.

(5)reference to a number of factors providing guidance in assessing the severity of the applicant's underlying depression and bipolar disorder at the time of the offending, namely, 

(i)That there was no real basis for concluding that the applicant's answers and appearance in the record of interview were indicative of thought disorder.

(ii)That the Justice Health medical notes in the period soon after his entry into custody do not document thought disorder.

(iii)That the offender's stabilisation of mood after entering custody might, to a significant extent, be attributable to the cessation of alcohol use, on the basis that Dr Westmore noted in his report of 2 March 2012 that the applicant told him that his mental state had settled as a result of cessation of alcohol use.

(iv)That the applicant's marked change in response to medication after entering custody did not necessarily provide proof of a previous underlying psychosis.


53It is at this point that the judge arrives at a final assessment of the applicant's moral culpability having regard to the consistent psychiatric opinion of bipolar II affective disorder and alcohol abuse disorder. The passage set out above upon which the applicant relies occurs in the following context :-

It is reasonable to conclude, based upon the evidence of Mrs Debra Peters, to which I have referred, that the offender was experiencing symptoms of depression at the material time of the offending and was suffering mood changes. I have referred to the evidence concerning the severity of the symptoms experienced, particularly the evidence of Mrs Debra Peters; clinical observations of the offender since he entered into custody and the opinions of psychiatrists as to the manifestations of those symptoms prior, at the time of and the period following the offending. Having considered the evidence I cannot be satisfied that the severity of the conditions significantly impaired the offender's judgment at the time of the offending. To the extent that the underlying conditions impaired his judgment, in my view, that impairment does not significantly reduce the moral culpability of the offending. It has not been shown that the underlying conditions contributed to the offending in a material way.

[The judge then refers to the absence of evidence from the applicant to explain the offending. The passage set out at [48] immediately follows.]

The offender would have been aware that after he left the victim she would have experienced considerable trauma before it was determined that the device did not contain explosives. He would have understood, at that time, in the many hours that followed she was in fear she would be killed. The photographs of the young girl with a device around her neck conveyed the terror she experienced.

It would be artificial to totally remove consideration of the offender's depressive state when setting the sentence. I propose to allow some moderation to the sentence because of the offender's depression, however the moderation is minimal. In the circumstances here, whilst the offender's depression provides some background to his offending it does not significantly reduce the weight to be given to deterrence.


54Ultimately, the judge determined that the applicant had not discharged his onus of establishing a significant link between the offending behaviour and his psychiatric condition. In particular, his Honour was not persuaded that the applicant's mental illness significantly impacted upon his judgment so as to reduce his moral culpability, principally for the reason that the enormity of his criminality must have been appreciated by him at the time of the offence, yet he proceeded nonetheless.

55His Honour was entitled to make an evaluative judgment in the terms that he did. It is not the case that he drew the conclusion that the applicant's psychiatric condition was not causally related to his offending conduct. Rather, his Honour drew the conclusion that it was not significantly causally related to the offending conduct.

56None of the findings set out at [52] are challenged by the applicant, with the exception of (5)(iii) (ground 3(b)). I return to that matter below. The applicant does, however, place particular emphasis upon the findings at (4) and 5(iv) in support of his submission that the judge erred in his approach to the issue of mental illness. It was never the applicant's case that he was psychotic. The applicant argues that, in effect, his Honour dismissed the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and depression by discounting a diagnosis of psychosis.

57I do not accept that submission. His Honour was, in his usual careful and thorough manner, addressing the opinion of Dr Phillips, who was ""the only psychiatrist who .. made a clinical observation of psychosis"". Dr Phillips observed that during his clinical consultations with the applicant, the applicant ""lapsed into a psychotic state when referring to the book"". This aspect of his Honour's remarks occupies half a dozen paragraphs in the context of a discussion about the relationship, if any, between the offending and the authorship of the book. There is no indication that the judge placed undue weight upon the absence of psychosis in order to reach the ultimate conclusion. A reference to the opinion of one psychiatrist which was at odds with an otherwise uniform diagnosis was justifiable in the interests of completeness.

58It is uncontroversial that general and specific deterrence may be given less weight when sentencing a mentally ill offender because ""the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his .. cognitive facilities or emotional restraints and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments."" : R v Henry & Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [254] per Wood CJ at CL. This statement is not confined to the existence of a mental disorder at the time of offending. It has been confirmed on a number of occasions since then that it also applies at the time of sentence : R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21] ; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14] - [16] ; Leach v R [2008] NSWCCA 73 at [10] and [11] ; Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 at [81].

59The applicant's second ground of appeal is inextricably linked to the first ground, in that it relies upon error in the judge's assessment of the causative link between the offending and the applicant's psychiatric disorder. The applicant has apparently been successfully treated since entering custody. There was no sound basis upon which the judge could conclude that the psychiatric disorder was likely to persist or was resistant to treatment and therefore no sound basis upon which his Honour was required to reduce emphasis on general and specific deterrence because of a mental illness at the time of sentence : see Carlton v R [2008] NSWCCA 244 per Basten JA at [101]. 

60With respect to ground 3(a), the applicant contends that the existence or otherwise of a causal link between a psychiatric condition and an offence is separate and distinct from the question whether general deterrence should be moderated or eliminated. The applicant then maintains that the judge erred in failing to consider ""the issue of the appropriateness of applying principles of general deterrence separately from his conclusion that the offender's moral culpability was not reduced by reason of his mental illness.""

61This submission tends to ignore the policy reasons underlying a decreased emphasis on general deterrence, explained succinctly by Wood CJ at CL in Henry and set out at [58] above. Moral culpability for an offence is attenuated because some (albeit not all) psychiatric illnesses compromise an offender's ability to make rational decisions. It is that reduced moral culpability that correspondingly impacts upon the weight to be given to general deterrence. In addition, there is an inevitable interplay of the various factors. To the extent that there is no, or very little, causal link between a mental illness and an offence, the mental illness may nonetheless be important to considerations of community protection, rehabilitation or the need for treatment in the community : Engert at 8 ; R v Israil per Spigelman CJ at [24], agreeing with Malcolm CJ in Lauritsen v R at [48].

62It is not clear how, assuming that the judge did not err in his assessment of the causative link between the applicant's bipolar disorder and the offending, any reduced weight on general deterrence arose because of that (successfully treated) condition at the time of sentence. As for the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, that is addressed under ground 5.

63I reject the submission that his Honour did not appreciate the severity of the applicant's symptoms of his bipolar disorder. His Honour said :-

It is reasonable to conclude, based upon consistent threads in the psychiatric opinion, that the offender suffered an Alcohol Abuse Disorder and Bipolar I (sic) Affective Disorder including a Major Depressive Disorder and mood changes. Bipolar I Disorder (sic) and Major Depression are serious mental disturbances. (italics not in original)

64The relevant and critical question was how, and to what extent, did those mental disturbances explain the applicant's offending, extending as it did from the purchase of the gun safe in the week prior to 30 May 2011, the creation of the ""dirkstraun"" email account while the applicant was on route to Australia from Chicago on 30 May, through to the alteration of the gun safe in June, the purchase of the balaclava and baseball bat on 16 July and culminating in the offence itself on 3 August. The explanation advanced through the medium of the psychiatric opinions, supported by the untested assertions of the applicant, was that the applicant's behaviour was unmotivated by anything other than a need for treatment, in other words, ""a cry for help"". The judge was entitled to reject that explanation and the applicant does not contend otherwise. Having done so, there was only the objective evidence of the applicant's planning and execution of a very daring and serious attempt at extortion. The fact that it was daring, or even deserving of the description ""bizarre"", does not establish the relevant causal link.

65The applicant's submission that the judge erred in finding that it was possible that his mood stabilised after entering custody because of cessation of alcohol use is qualified by this observation in the written submissions : ""If this conclusion was to the effect that the improvement observed by Dr Westmore in the applicant's mental health by September 2012 was brought about by nothing more than a period of abstinence from alcohol abuse, then the finding is erroneous.""

66The judge's reasons do not support that construction. The finding was that the applicant's stabilisation of mood may, to a significant extent, be attributable to cessation of alcohol use. There are a number of references throughout the judge's reasons to the marked improvement in the applicant's mental health after commencement of the appropriate medication (Risperidone) in custody. This was no more than an observation which was supported by the applicant's own statement to Dr Westmore. 

67In summary, the applicant has not demonstrated that the sentencing discretion has miscarried. The judge's findings with respect to the causative link between the applicant's bipolar II disorder and the offending were reasonably open. There is no merit in grounds 1, 2 or 3. 

Ground 4 : Error in Concluding that a Non-Parole Period Greater than the Standard Non-Parole Period was Warranted after only Considering the Objective Seriousness of the Offending Conduct.

68The applicant's submissions on this ground claim that the judge committed Muldrock error (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 ; 244 CLR 120) by, in effect, engaging in a two-stage approach to sentencing. That was evident, according to the applicant, from the judge's statement that :-

I am of the view that such is the objective gravity of the offending that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period greater than the standard non-parole period.

This statement is said to demonstrate that his Honour was using the standard non parole period as a ""springboard"" towards the ultimate sentence and that it therefore offended against the requirement of instinctive synthesis.

69The full context of what his Honour said must be appreciated. The judge assessed the objective gravity of the offence as ""of a most serious kind."" That he did so by reference to the objective features of the offence is entirely consistent with Muldrock, in particular, at [27]. The judge then turned to a consideration of Muldrock under the heading ""The Approach to Sentencing for an Offence Involving a Standard Non-Parole Period."" The very first paragraph under that heading is :-

In Muldrock v The Queen ... the High Court, in a joint judgment, said that s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act read with ss 54B(3) and 21A, requires an approach to sentencing for offences carrying a standard non parole period that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [49]. That is, that a sentencing judge ""... identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case.


70The judge then refers to that passage in Muldrock which obliges the court to undertake that exercise, ""mindful of two legislative guideposts : the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period."" It is at this point that the judge reaches the conclusion that, based upon his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence, a non-parole period in excess of the relevant legislative guide post was warranted. 

71That conclusion is hardly surprising, given that the standard non-parole period represents one quarter of the maximum penalty. The level of the standard non-parole period for this offence no doubt reflects the very broad circumstances of offending under s 112(2). The indictable offence invariably charged under this provision is that of stealing, anything from a television set to valuable jewellery. However, a detention for advantage represents a different order of criminality, particularly in the circumstances of this case. 

72I do not accept that Zahra SC DCJ adopted a two-stage approach, especially after drawing attention in his remarks to the critical passages in Muldrock and its endorsement of McHugh J's judgment in Markarian. Moreover, the argument on this ground is a variant of that advanced in R v Ramea [2013] NSWCCA 310, wherein I said (Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing) :-

19 That passage from Markarian describes ""two tier"" sentencing :-
By two-tier sentencing, I mean the method of sentencing by which a judge first determines a sentence by reference to the ""objective circumstances"" of the case. This is the first tier of the process. The judge then increases or reduces this hypothetical sentence incrementally or decrementally by reference to other factors, usually, but not always, personal to the accused. This is the second tier. By instinctive synthesis, I mean the method of sentencing by which the judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case. Only at the end of the process does the judge determine the sentence.


20 However, it is also relevant to bear in mind that :-
It is not useful to begin by asking a general question like was a ""staged sentencing process"" followed. That is not useful because the expression ""staged sentencing process"" may mean no more than that the reasoning adopted by the sentencer can be seen to have proceeded sequentially. Or it may mean only that some specific numerical or proportional allowance has been made by the sentencer in arriving at an ultimate sentence on some account such as assistance to authorities or a plea of guilty. Neither the conclusion that a sentencer has reasoned sequentially, nor the observation that a sentencer has quantified the allowance made, for example, on account of the offender's plea of guilty, or the offender's assistance to authorities, of itself, reveals error. Indeed provisions like s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) may require the sentencer, in some circumstances, to identify the amount by which a sentence has been reduced on some account.
Markarian at [24] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.


21 Markarian was not a standard non-parole period case. There is nothing in that decision which reduces the significance of legislative guideposts, such as the maximum penalty or a standard non-parole period, in the sentencing task. The plurality in Markarian at [30] and [31] recognised that careful attention ought be paid to legislative yardsticks. McHugh J at [80] recognised that maximum penalties and prescribed non-parole periods guide the judicial instinct. The vice identified in Markarian was determining a sentence referable to an offence, and then engaging in ""arithmetical deduction"" from that sentence for mitigating and/or subjective factors. The plurality also acknowledged at [39] :-
that is not to say that in a simple case, in which, for example, the circumstances of the crime have to be weighed against one or a small number of other important matters, indulgence in arithmetical deduction by the sentencing judges should be absolutely forbidden.
...
25 ...The argument that, in effect, every judge who deals with an assessment of the objective gravity of a given offence before a consideration of the offender's subjective case is ipso facto engaging in two-stage sentencing, gains no support from Muldrock and is at odds with the passage from Markarian set out at [20] above. Nothing in Muldrock prohibits an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence. On the contrary, it is explicitly recognised that the objective seriousness of an offence must be assessed wholly by reference to the nature of the offending [27]. Whether that is undertaken before or after dealing with the offender's subjective case is for the most part irrelevant to the detection of Muldrock error.


73I would reject this ground.

Ground 5 : Error in Failing to Make a Finding Regarding the Applicant's Prospects of Rehabilitation.

74This ground may be briefly dealt with. The applicant contends that his Honour made no finding regarding his prospects of rehabilitation.

75At page 46 of the remarks on sentence, there appears a heading ""Prospects of Rehabilitation"". Under that heading, the judge canvasses Dr Westmore's reports of 2 March 2012 and 10 September 2012, wherein Dr Westmore said that the applicant's risk of re-offending was low to non-existent, provided that when he returns to the community he ceases drinking alcohol and receives psychiatric care. Dr Westmore also noted that the applicant did not represent an ongoing risk to the community, that he did not have an antisocial personality disorder and that his behaviour appeared to be uncharacteristic.

76The judge also referred to Dr Phillips' view that with continuing psychiatric treatment and medication, it was unlikely that the applicant would re-offend.

77Thereafter, His Honour said :-
The offender faces a lengthy period of imprisonment, which is likely to offer substantial specific deterrence. The risk of his re-offending could be said to be low.

78Whilst his Honour did not expressly use the term ""prospects of rehabilitation"" in the course of this discussion, it is implicit in this portion of the remarks on sentence that his Honour accepted, subject to the conditions outlined by Dr Westmore and Dr Phillips, that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.

79In my view, this ground has no merit.

Ground 6 : Error in Failing to Find Special Circumstances.

80This ground alleges error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion in failing to find special circumstances for the purpose of altering the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The difficulty which the applicant confronts on this ground is that a sentencing judge is not bound to find special circumstances, with the consequence that it will be rare that this Court will intervene when the circumstances relied upon are not of a particularly special character: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264; Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277.

81At page 47 of the remarks on sentence under the heading ""Hardship in Custody/Special Circumstances"", the judge referred to Dr Westmore's opinion with respect to the applicant's good response to treatment and concluded that it was not possible to predict that the applicant would find his conditions of imprisonment significantly more onerous or that he would spend any time in some form of restricted custody. It is not submitted that this finding was not open to his Honour.

82The judge then dealt with the basis upon which special circumstances were pressed in the applicant's written submissions before him. Those matters were the applicant's age, the fact that it was his first time in custody, that his mental illness rendered his custody more onerous and the need for a lengthy period of supervision on parole. The judge had already dealt with the penultimate factor.

83The judge went on to note that the sentence itself would provide for a lengthy period of parole supervision (3 years and 6 months). The applicant's age (51 at the time of sentence) and the fact that it was his first time in custody do not, in isolation or when considered with the other factors relied upon, compel the conclusion that special circumstances existed. In addition, the applicant acknowledges that the non-parole period was required to reflect the objective gravity of the offence. I return to this aspect of the sentence under ground 7.

84In my view, there is no merit in this ground.

Ground 7 : Manifest Excess

85The applicant's submissions on this ground commence with the observation that, allowing for the 25% discount for the applicant's early plea of guilty, the starting point for the head sentence amounted to 18 years' imprisonment, or 90% of the statutory maximum. It is then submitted that a sentence of that magnitude is reserved for a worst-case and that no such finding was made.

86The applicant's review of sentences imposed for offences contrary to s 112 (2) and s 86 (1) of the Crimes Act demonstrates that no sentence has approached the length of the instant sentence, save for Tattersall v R [2011] NSWCCA 282, where the offender received a sentence of 14 years and 5 months imprisonment, including a non-parole period of 11 years for an offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, and R v Stott [2005] NSWCCA 36, where the offender was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment, including a non-parole period of 9 years.

87The applicant next submits that the instant offence did not approach a worst case for a variety of reasons, including the applicant's age and his prior good character, that the applicant suffered from a significant psychiatric illness at the time of his offending, and that whilst the package secured to the victim's neck had the appearance of a bomb, it was in fact harmless. With respect to this last factor, the applicant submits that the objective seriousness of the offence was reduced by the fact that there was no possibility of an explosion.

88Accepting that the judge did not use the terminology ""worst case"" when assessing its objective gravity, I have no doubt that his Honour regarded it as approaching the worst case for an offence under s 112(2) and that a starting point of 18 years reflects his Honour's assessment. The reference to this offence as one ""of a most serious kind"" conveys in ordinary English words that the offence was at the upper end of objective gravity comprehended by the maximum penalty. 

89The judge's conclusions with respect to the applicant's careful and methodical planning and execution of the offence, the applicant's failure to disclose the harmless nature of the device thereby prolonging the victim's suffering, and the ""guarded and qualified"" expressions of remorse to various psychiatrists, are not challenged. The circumstances of the offence need only be related to reveal its extraordinary criminality. 

90The applicant's subjective case did little to reduce his moral culpability. The applicant's submission that the absence of a real explosive necessarily reduced the objective gravity of the offence is rejected. Had that been the case, no doubt the applicant would have been charged with a more serious offence, such as the specially aggravated form of the offence that would expose the applicant to a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The absence of aggravating factors does not operate in a mitigatory way : Louizos v R [2009] NSWCCA 71 ; 194 A Crim R 223, per Howie J at [91] - [92], (McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing).

91The non-parole period of 10 years was entirely appropriate, in my view, to reflect the objective gravity of this offence. The fact that it represents twice the standard non-parole period says nothing about manifest excess.

92Despite the severity of the sentence, I am not persuaded that it is plainly unjust. This ground of appeal also fails.

93I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

94R A HULME J : I agree with Latham J.

95BARR AJ : I agree with Latham J.

2763058,Tran v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 322,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
2HOEBEN CJ at CL:This matter came before the Court on 13 December 2013.  Having heard argument, the Court granted leave to appeal against sentence but dismissed the appeal.  The Court ordered that reasons would be given in due course.  These are the reasons for the Court's decision.
Offence and sentence
3The applicant pleaded guilty to supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.  The amount of drug concerned was 22.05 grams of crystal methylamphetamine.
4On 19 February 2013 in the District Court at Goulburn Toner DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 19 months with a non-parole period of 14 months.  His Honour determined that the sentence should commence on 19 December 2012, that the non-parole period would expire on 18 February 2014 and that the balance of term would expire on 18 July 2014.
5The applicant's sentence was made partially concurrent with the balance of parole for an offence of murder for which the applicant was sentenced on 3 May 2001 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.  That sentence was imprisonment for 13 years, to date from 29 December 1999 and which was to expire on 19 December 2012.  There was a non-parole period of 8 years, which expired on 19 December 2007.
6It was common ground that the applicant was released to parole for the murder offence on a number of occasions and on each occasion parole was breached and the applicant was returned to custody.  It was also common ground that the applicant's balance of parole expired on 20 March 2013.  The sentencing judge was erroneously told that the balance of parole would expire on 16 April 2013.
7The applicant sought leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient concurrence between the balance of parole being served and the sentence imposed.
Ground 2 - The learned sentencing judge had regard to an excessive quantum of drug in determining the appropriate sentence.
Ground 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to the correct maximum penalty when imposing sentence.
Ground 4 - The sentence is manifestly excessive.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
8At approximately 3am on 11 January 2011 police stopped a black Honda Civic in which the applicant was a front seat passenger.  The driver of the vehicle was the applicant's wife.  On searching the car, the police found a soft drink can in the centre console.  Inside the soft drink can was a glass jar containing four bags of crystal methylamphetamine totalling 22.05 grams.
9When arrested, the applicant said that the crystal methylamphetamine was in his possession.  During an ERISP conducted at Goulburn Police Station the applicant said that he was paid $500 to convey the drug from Cabramatta to Ngunnawal Leagues Club where he would be paid a further $500 upon delivery of the can to a third party.  The purity of the drug was substantial, i.e., 81.5 percent.  
10The Crown accepted that the role of the applicant was that of a courier.  While his Honour was somewhat sceptical of that concession, he agreed to sentence the applicant on that basis.  In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour noted that the quantity of drug was 4 or 5 times the indictable quantity of 5 grams.  There was no evidence before his Honour as to the street value or wholesale value of the drugs.  
11In relation to the applicant's subjective case, the applicant was aged 30 at the time of the offence and 32 at the time of sentence.  His Honour considered that the applicant's history was a sad one, having spent the whole of his adult life in custody.  That was because he was a juvenile at the time that he committed the murder offence.
12When reciting the facts, the sentencing judge erroneously believed that the applicant's parole for the murder offence had been revoked because of the offence, the subject of this application.  That was not correct.  On 15 December 2011 the Parole Authority revoked the applicant's parole on the basis of a breach of condition 5 - fail to report to the officer as directed and condition 21 - which required the applicant to enter a residential rehabilitation centre.  The applicant was not returned to custody in accordance with that revocation of parole until 11 January 2012.
13During two occasions that he had been released to parole, the applicant fathered two children, who at the time of sentence were aged 4 and 6 months.  The applicant submitted that now that he was a father he had found a new sense of responsibility.  His Honour rejected that submission because of his continued drug use on each occasion that he had been released to parole.  His Honour was sceptical of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.
14His Honour did, however, allow the applicant a 25 percent discount for his plea of guilty.  His Honour did not think there was any other discounting factor which he could take into account.  His Honour declined to find special circumstances because in his opinion there were none.  Because of the Crown's concession, however, his Honour sentenced the applicant as a courier whose position could be characterised as someone towards the bottom of the hierarchy of those involved in the criminal enterprise.  His Honour noted that it would be impossible for such drug supply businesses to flourish without the contribution of persons such as the applicant.
15Because of his Honour's misunderstanding as to the reason why the applicant's parole was revoked, he determined that there should be a degree of concurrence between the sentence which he was going to impose and the balance of parole which was being served by the applicant.  On the basis of his understanding that the parole period would expire on 16 April 2013, his Honour backdated the commencement of the sentence to 19 December 2012, i.e., there was a 4 month period of concurrency.
Ground 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient concurrence between the balance of parole being served and the sentence imposed.
16In the course of oral submissions, the applicant accepted that this ground of appeal was based on the same misunderstanding as that of the sentencing judge, i.e., that the reason for the revocation of parole was this offence.  Because that was not the case, the applicant accepted that it was purely a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge as to how much concurrency (if any) he should allow between the sentence imposed for this offence and the applicant's balance of parole.
Ground 2 - The learned sentencing judge had regard to an excessive quantum of drug in determining the appropriate sentence.
17The basis for this submission was that the sentencing judge had erroneously sentenced on the basis that the amount of the drug involved was 24.3 grams when in fact the quantity was 22.05 grams.  In oral submissions the applicant accepted that in the absence of any other compelling ground of appeal, this discrepancy in fact finding was so minor as to not form a proper basis for interfering with the sentence imposed.
Ground 3 - The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to the correct maximum penalty when imposing sentence.
18It was common ground that his Honour had erroneously sentenced on the basis that the maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 18 years.  As already indicated, the maximum penalty was in fact imprisonment for 15 years.  The Crown accepted that this was a patent error, sufficient to justify the granting of leave to appeal against sentence.  As such, the Crown accepted that s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applied so that this Court needed to assess for itself whether in all the circumstances a lesser sentence should have been imposed.
19Because of this concession by the Crown, the applicant did not in terms pursue Ground 4.  Rather he deployed the arguments which had been raised in relation to Ground 4 as reasons why a lesser sentence was warranted by law.
20That in fact became the substance of the argument made to the Court.
21The applicant submitted that he had in reality been in custody since 11 January 2012 as a result of this offending.  He had spent his adult life in custody.  He was a low level operative within the drug supply system, i.e. a courier.  By reference to the statistics relating to this offence, 69 percent of offenders had received a non-parole period which was less than that imposed upon him.
22Finally, the applicant submitted that because his Honour had intended to make the sentence which he imposed concurrent with the applicant's balance of parole to the extent of 4 months, this Court should do the same.  This would mean that the applicant's release date would come forward one month to 18 January 2014.
23The Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted in law.  This was because the sentence imposed was well within the range of sentences revealed by the statistics.  Apart from his plea of guilty, there was no other mitigating factor associated with the applicant's offending.  The finding that the applicant was a courier was a generous one as his Honour noted.  The purity of the methylamphetamine was high (81.5 percent), which indicated that the drug had been intercepted before it had been broken down and prepared for street level sales.  The findings made by the sentencing judge were appropriate and the sentence was consistent with them.
24The Crown submitted that when allowing 4 months concurrency in the applicant's favour between this sentence and his balance of parole, his Honour had been influenced by his incorrect understanding of what had led to the revocation of parole.  The Crown submitted that this Court, being aware that the revocation of parole related purely to the applicant's drug taking and failure to adhere to parole conditions rather than this offence, should not be influenced by the level of concurrency found by his Honour.  The Crown submitted that this offence and the revocation of parole had no relationship so that any degree of concurrency found by this Court would be generous towards the applicant.
25The applicant's subjective case and the objective features of his offending were fully reviewed by the sentencing judge.  In doing so, the sentencing judge noted the seriousness of the offending and with some reservations accepted the Crown concession that the applicant was only a courier.  There were no findings in mitigation and no realistic prospects of rehabilitation.  The sentence was well within the range for an offence of this kind.
26Taking into account those matters in the re-sentencing exercise, I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted in law.  It was for these reasons that the Court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal.
27R A HULME J:  The reasons set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL provide the basis for my agreement with the orders granting leave but dismissing the appeal.

		08 January 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763059,Khoo v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 323,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of R S Hulme AJ. I agree with his Honour's reasons and conclusions. I also agree with the additional observations of Bellew J. I wish to provide the following additional reasons why ground (viii), which asserted that the sentence of full time imprisonment was manifestly excessive, should be rejected.

2I start with authority. In R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131, McCallum J said at [79]: 

""The acquisition or disposal of financial products by people having the unfair advantage of inside information is criminalised because it has the capacity to unravel the public trust which is critical to the viability of the market. It is, as previously observed by this Court, a form of cheating. The fact that people of otherwise good character and compelling personal circumstances are tempted to engage in such conduct emphasises the need for the clear deterrent that insider traders should expect to go to gaol.""

The applicant submitted that that passage was obiter, and distinguishable from the ""tipping"" offences he had committed. I disagree.

3First, the passage was not obiter. It was a summary statement of her Honour's reasons for agreeing with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL. Moreover, the third member of the Court, Rothman J, expressly associated himself with it. It follows that the passage amounts to reasoning which two members of the Court treated as dispositive. If it were a principle of law, it would be ratio, for, as Jordan CJ said, ""we are not entitled to pick out one reason for the judgment as the ratio decidendi and neglect the other"": Ex parte King; Re Blackley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 483 at 490.

4Secondly, the distinction between ratio decidendi and obiter dicta is not directly applicable to appellate statements about the sentencing process. Nevertheless, the applicant was correct to appreciate that the passage in Glynatsis was a substantial obstacle to his submission. The need for consistency in sentencing under federal law is self-evident, and in considering the sufficiency of sentences passed on federal offenders, intermediate appellate courts should not depart from what is decided by other Australian intermediate appellate courts, ""unless convinced that the decision is plainly wrong"": Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [57]. This is not the occasion to consider what is meant by ""plainly wrong"" in this context (which has been examined by Heydon J in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [83]-[87] and Basten JA in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 at [30]-[40]), for in my view the passage is plainly right, at least in relation to the present form of the legislation. How else to construe the increase in maximum penalty from 5 to 10 years imprisonment? (See item 310 of Schedule 3 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), amended by Corporations Amendment (No 1) Act 2010; some of Mr Khoo's offences preceded the amendment.)

5Thirdly, the approach contained in Glynatsis - that offenders should expect to go to gaol - ought not be read as confined to insider trading as opposed to ""tipping"". True it is that her Honour's proposition was expressed to be based upon the acquisition or disposal of financial products. But s 1043A(2) of the Corporations Act applies only when there is a trade or likely trade, and the same unravelling of public trust occurs when inside information is communicated in those circumstances. There is no sound basis in the text of the statute, or the penalty imposed for its contravention, or the legislative purpose, to distinguish insider trading forbidden by s 1043A(1) from ""tipping"" forbidden by s 1043A(2). The primary contravention is the misuse of ""inside information"" as defined by s 1042A (broadly, market-sensitive information which is not generally available). 

6Central to Mr Khoo's submission on this issue was the proposition that the offence of insider trading involved more elements than tipping (possession and use of insider information plus trading) and was therefore necessarily more objectively criminal. As it was put by his counsel, ""until there's a trade, the impact on the integrity of the market is not affected"". 

7To the extent that the legislation protects equality of information in a fair market, Mr Khoo's submission cannot be true. The dissemination of information to a ""tippee"" may indeed be a greater threat to market integrity than actual trading by an insider. There is no novelty in that observation. The issues paper prepared for the National Companies and Securities Commission, Insider Trading Legislation for Australia: An Outline of the Issues and Alternatives (1986, AGPS) stated at p 62:

""Indeed, because of the ready transmissibility of information, tipping is arguably a more serious threat to the integrity of the securities market than trading, for the more widespread it becomes the greater will be the potential for trading.""

8That passage cited the concurring judgment of Celebrezze J in Fridrich v Bradford 542 F 2d 307 at 327 (1976), who said:

""Tipping because it involves a more widespread imbalance of information presents an even greater threat to the integrity of the marketplace than simple insider trading. Tipping, by its very nature, is a more open-ended violation than that of the insider who enters the market, trades on his own account and withdraws.""

9Care must be taken in relying on United States decisions (which are a product of a body of judge-made law derived from high level prohibitions against market fraud: see R Baxt, A Black and P Hanrahan, Securities and Financial Services Law, 8th ed (2012) LexisNexis, at 690-692). But what Celebrezze J said is (to my mind self-evidently) correct.

10Further, it is clear that the ""victims"" of insider trading are not merely those participants who trade, but the investing community at large, because the injury derives from ""the loss of confidence in the efficacy and integrity of the market in public securities"": R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [412]. ""Tipping"" is no different. The vice of tipping is not confined to the individual securities which are traded by the tippee. Where the size of the trade is small compared with daily turnover (which will be most cases), it is no answer to the objective criminality to submit, as Mr Khoo in substance did, that the trade made not a jot of difference to the price. Indeed, although it is unnecessary for present purposes to express a concluded view, it seems plausible that the impact of tipping extends beyond the particular security. Australian securities markets are relatively attractive to local and overseas investment because there is perceived to be an efficient and effective regime protecting their integrity. The attractiveness of the market as a whole is impacted by the unequal dissemination of information.

11Mr Khoo's submission that the criminality of insider trading inevitably exceeds that of ""tipping"" must be rejected. There is no a priori rule that mandates that tipping is less criminal than insider trading. Both are forms of conduct prohibited by subsections (1) and (2) of the same section. Within the class of conduct which contravenes s 1043A(2), there are varying degrees of criminality (contrast communicating inside information to a relative in need to communicating the same information to a broker, for reward, in the belief that it will be disseminated more broadly). The relevant factors in any particular case are identified by Bellew J. Those factors were taken into account by the sentencing judge, as R S Hulme AJ has explained in detail, and I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusion that the ultimate sentence imposed was within the range open to the sentencing judge.

12BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of R S Hulme AJ. I agree with his Honour's reasons, and the orders that he proposes. I have similarly had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgment of Leeming JA and I also agree with his Honour's observations.

13However, I wish to add the following observations in respect of ground (viii) which asserted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.

14In my view, the factors relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of so-called ""tipping"" offences include (although are not limited to) the following:

(i)the nature and importance of the information which was disclosed;
(ii)the extent of the disclosure;
(iii)whether the offender knew that the person(s) to whom the information was disclosed would use it for the purposes of trading and/or profit taking;
(iv)the nature and extent of any breach of trust involved in such disclosure;
(v)whether such disclosure involved any element of sophistication or subterfuge;
(vi)whether the offending involved a course of conduct; and
(vii)the extent of any profit made, be it by the offender or by those to whom the information was disclosed.

15In the present case Judge Marien found that the offending was toward the mid range of objective seriousness. Taking into account the factors to which I have referred, that finding was clearly open. 

16The information disclosed by the applicant in the present case was, in each instance, properly described by the sentencing judge (at ROS 30) as being of a ""high quality"". It related to significant take-over bids and its general nature was such that, once publicly released, it would be expected to have an immediate effect upon the relevant share price. The fact that the people to whom the applicant disclosed the information were friends does not, in my view, render that aspect of his conduct any less serious. The more important consideration is that once the information was disclosed, the applicant lost control over it. 

17Moreover, Judge Marien found (at ROS 22) that it was highly likely that the applicant acted in the knowledge that those to whom he passed the information would use it to trade. He also found (at ROS 22) that the applicant hoped that a profit would be made, and (at ROS 33) that the applicant was motivated by a desire that such a profit would in fact eventuate. 

18The applicant obviously knew that the information was highly confidential. In the case of the offences relating to Macarthur Coal, he had been a member of the relevant advisory team for more than two months in the period leading up to the date of his offending. His role included providing advice as to the proposed takeover, as a consequence of which confidential information was communicated to him. The fact that such information was communicated in a partially coded form necessarily served as a constant reminder to the applicant of the need to protect its confidentiality. Moreover, as a condition of his employment, the applicant had been made aware of relevant policies, and had undergone training, which focussed upon the necessity to preserve the confidentiality of such information, and the legal prohibitions against insider trading. 

19All of these matters lead to Judge Marien finding (at ROS 29) that the applicant's conduct constituted a gross breach of trust. That finding was clearly open, even in circumstances where the applicant's conduct did not involve any element of sophistication or subterfuge (see R v De Silva [2011] NSWSC 243 at [61]).

20It was also relevant for Judge Marien to take into account the fact that the applicant's offending was not limited to one isolated instance. He disclosed information on four separate occasions, to two separate individuals, over a period of ten months. The recipients of the information derived total profits exceeding $100,000.00. As I have previously noted, Judge Marien not only found that the applicant had hoped that such profits would eventuate, but that he was motivated by a desire that they would.

21I would, for my part, eschew the use of labels such as ""true insider"" to describe the applicant's position and offending (see De Silva (supra) at [61]). Such an approach has the capacity to obscure an assessment of what the applicant actually did (see R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54 at 279; [19]). The important consideration is that the applicant's position gave him access to confidential information. In the circumstances I have summarised, and which are more fully set out in the reasons of Judge Marien, the applicant used that information in a way which had the capacity to cause damage not only to the market, but to those who invested in it. 

22In my view, all of these matters supported Judge Marien's conclusions as to the objective seriousness of the offending. General deterrence remained an important consideration (see Hartman v R [2011] NSWSC 261 at [77]) particularly in light of the difficulty in detecting offending of this nature. Even allowing for the applicant's subjective case, the overall sentence imposed was not manifestly excessive. 

23R S HULME AJ: On 8 August 2013, the abovenamed Applicant was sentenced by Judge Marien SC in respect of 4 offences arising pursuant to the terms of s 1043A(2)(d) of the Corporations Act 2011 (Cth). The offences were to the effect that:

Between ... and ... whilst in possession of inside information concerning (a named company) that was not generally available, being information which if it was generally available a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price of the Division 3 financial products in (the company) and being information which the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known - 

(i) was not generally available, and

(ii) if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of the relevant Division 3 financial products,

directly communicated the inside information to another, knowing that person would, or would be likely to acquire relevant Division 3 financial products in the company.


24The first offence occurred between 19 September and 12 October 2010, related to a company Caledon Resources PLC and the person to whom the information was communicated was Jia Tan.

25The second offence occurred between 1 October and 28 November 2010, related to a company Mantra Resources Ltd and the person to whom the information was communicated was Jia Tan.

26The third offence occurred between 25 June and 7 July 2010, related to a company Macarthur Coal Limited and the person to whom the information was communicated was again Jia Tan.

27The fourth offence occurred between 25 June and 8 July 2010, related also to Macarthur Coal Limited and the person to whom the information was communicated was David Luong.

28The sentences imposed by his Honour were:-

Counts 1 and 2 - imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 8 August 2013; and

Counts 3 and 4 - imprisonment for one year and eight months commencing on 8 November 2013.

29The effective sentence was thus imprisonment for 1 year and 11 months. His Honour directed the Applicant's release on 8 October 2014, i.e. after the expiration of 14 months, conditional upon him entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour.

30The offences arose under s 1043A, s 1311 and Schedule 3 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). In the circumstances of this case the maximum penalty provided for each of the first and second offences was 5 years imprisonment and, by reason of the Corporations Amendment (No 1) Act 2010 (Cth), for each of the third and fourth offences 10 years imprisonment plus a fine of $495,000.

31The matter proceeded before his Honour largely by way of a Statement of Facts originally drafted by ASIC, but ultimately containing some amendments to which both parties had agreed. At all relevant times the Applicant was employed at the Sydney office of the Royal Bank of Canada (hereinafter referred to as ""RBC""), working in the Investment Banking Team. In that capacity he routinely acquired information about proposed takeovers, mergers, acquisitions and capital raisings. He had a base salary of some $140,000 and his last annual bonus was something over $120,000. 

32In the course of his employment he had received substantial instructions on RBC's Code of Conduct and other policies proscribing the unjustified publication and misuse of confidential information and demonstrated a knowledge and understanding of such matters. At all relevant times he was aware of the legal prohibitions on insider trading and passing on ""inside information"" as that term is defined in the Corporations Act 2011 (Cth) to others.

33Mr Tan was a close friend of the Applicant. To the knowledge of the Applicant, Mr Tan had for many years been a day trader in high volumes of CFDs and other securities. 

34Mr Luong was also a close friend of the Applicant. To the knowledge of the Applicant Mr Tan had for many years been a regular day trader in CFDs and other securities. 

35The information provided by the Applicant to these persons was:-

Count 1 Guangdon Rising Assets Management Co Ltd intended to make a takeover bid for Caledon Resources PLC;

Count 2 JSC Atomredmetzoloto was planning to made an all cash takeover bid for the acquisition of Mantra Resources Limited at a price involving a substantial premium of the prevailing share price

Counts 3, 4 A client of Royal Bank of Canada would soon be launching a takeover bid for Macarthur Coal Limited

36Although I do not think it matters, the Statement of Facts said that it was not alleged that the Applicant actually knew that Mr Tan and Mr Luong would engage in their particular trading at the time he communicated the respective pieces of information.

37Each of Mr Tan and Mr Luong acted on the information supplied by the Applicant. Mr Tan and Mr Luong acquired financial products worth some $257,800 and $49,600 respectively. The profits made were:-

Count 1 $26,750 (approximately), 

Count 2 $18,660,

Count 3 $39,820, and

Count 4 $24,987

38The Applicant pleaded guilty to the charges against him on the first occasion when he could have done so. Earlier, he had been interviewed by officers of the ASIC and had provided a degree of co-operation referred to in more detail below.

39The Grounds advanced in support of the challenge to the sentences imposed were:-

(i) His Honour failed to provide an appropriate discount for the admissions made by Mr Khoo to ASIC.

(ii) Given the submissions made by the Crown, his Honour erred by failing to have regard to the sentences imposed in DPP v Lindskog [2013] VCC (unreported, Parsons CCJ, 14 March 2013)

(iii) His Honour erred by failing to provide for the pregnancy termination by Mr Khoo's partner

(iv) His Honour erred by placing undue emphasis that the fact that the offences involved tipping

(v) His Honour failed to have regard to the principles of parity.

(vi) His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the fact that the offender tipped persons who were: -

(a) not of a familial identity,

(b) in financial need.

(vii) Given his Honour imposed a sentence of full time imprisonment and Mr Khoo had cooperated with ASIC and the Crown a discount ought to have been allowed for the more difficult custodial environment.

(viii) The sentence were manifestly excessive. 

40Ground (i)
His Honour failed to provide an appropriate discount for the admissions made by Mr Khoo to ASIC.

41In his Honour's remarks on sentence he observed that he was satisfied that assistance offered by the Applicant to give evidence against Tan and Luong played an important role in those persons pleading guilty to charges against them. His Honour recorded that the Applicant's pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity and he proposed to accord those pleas full weight. Later his Honour went on:-

I propose to discount the sentences that I would otherwise impose upon the offender, firstly in relation to sequences 1 and 2 for his pleas of guilty and co-operation and with some allowance of an Ellis discount by a factor in the order of 40% and in relation to sequences 3 and 4 for his co-operation and his pleas of guilty a discount in the order 35%. (sic)

42In support of this ground attention was directed to aspects of the evidence before his Honour, in particular some remarks by an ASIC officer, a Mr Watson. Under cross-examination Mr Watson agreed that the Applicant's ""admission and concession in relation to Mantra and Caledon were very important in being able to put evidence to the DPP to be here today"" and that the Crown would have had a difficulty in showing that the Applicant realised the possibility that Tan and Luong would trade if he had not made admissions in that regard. However Mr Watson was not challenged on other statements to which I now refer. 

43This evidence was to the effect that in July 2011 as an incident of its normal activities ASIC became suspicious of transactions by Mr Tan and Mr Luong involving Macarthur Coal. On 13 October 2011 the Applicant was first interviewed concerning those transactions. He made no significant admissions and denied speaking to Tan or Luong about the proposed takeover of that company. At the time and although there was then no discussion concerning Caledon and Mantra, ASIC officers contemplated they would seek to identify any other examples of insider trading by the Applicant, Mr Tan or Mr Luong.

44On 20 October 2011 the Applicant participated in a compulsory examination. On 11 November 2011, according to the Statement of Facts, the Applicant's solicitor met with offices of ASIC and indicated that the Applicant was willing to voluntarily co-operate with ASIC and consider pleading guilty to appropriate offences.

45On 17 November 2011 the Applicant participated in a second voluntary interview and was asked whether he had told Tan about any other deals he had worked on. According to a statement of Mr Watson, an ASIC investigator, the Applicant referred to ""some aspect of the insider trading offences relating to Caledon and Mantra"" but his answers did not significantly add to ASIC's prior knowledge of those suspected offences. His answers were relatively general and vague and he stated that he could not remember or recall various relevant details. The answers did not constitute full admissions to any offence."" Somewhat inconsistently the Statement of Facts also said that during this 17 November interview the Applicant ""Made substantial admissions in relation to all of the offences ...""

46Mr Watson went on to say that even if the Applicant had provided no information about the Caledon and Mantra offences, he was certain that ASIC would have identified them by its standard investigation strategies although he conceded that he could not positively state that ASIC would have been able to prove the Caledon and Mantra offences beyond reasonable doubt in the absence of the Applicant's admissions. 

47His Honour did not attempt to resolve the inconsistencies in Mr Watson's evidence and of course this Court cannot do so. For my part I am not persuaded that but for the Applicant's admissions the Crown would have had difficulty in proving that the Applicant provided information to Tan and Khoo and that he knew that they would trade.

48One may take judicial notice of the fact that transactions in securities are recorded so there would seem to have been no difficulty in the Crown proving what Messrs Tan and Luong did. There would seem to have been no difficulty in proving that that trading was at times when the Applicant was in possession of confidential information. I would not infer that the Crown could not have proved that the Applicant and Messrs Tan and Luong were close friends and that he was aware that they were traders in securities. It was conceded that the Crown had plenty of phone records to demonstrate contact between the Applicant and those persons. 

49Of course any tribunal faced with these facts would have had to recognise the possibility that it was simply coincidence that Mr Tan traded when he did in securities in respect of which the Applicant had confidential information. However, given that this occurred 3 times, that possibility is not likely to have been accepted. The most probable inference is that Mr Tan had received the information that that Applicant had possessed. And if the inference were drawn that the Applicant had provided such information, it is almost inconceivable that he would have provided it without expecting his share trading friend to use it.

50A similar argument may be made in the case of Mr Luong. Given Mr Luong's dealings the subject of the charges involved only one company, the argument is weaker but the Crown could still pray in aid the similarities with Mr Tan's dealings.

51A further answer to the complaints made on behalf of the Applicant under this ground is that the Applicant's admissions, though made earlier, went no further than those implicit in his plea. To regard those earlier admissions as entitling the Applicant to any substantial discount in addition to that given for the plea involves an element of double counting.

52The submissions under this ground also contended that the Ellis discount should have been higher. In R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 the Chief Justice, with the concurrence of the other members of this Court, observed:-

... the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.

53When regard is had to the totality of Mr Watson's evidence I am not persuaded that the Applicant was entitled to much by way of an Ellis discount. Nor am I persuaded that there was any other error by his Honour in the other discount or discounts he did allow.

54This ground fails.

55Ground (ii)
Given the submissions made by the Crown, his Honour erred by failing to have regard to the sentence imposed in DPP v Lindskog [2013] VCC (unreported, Parsons CCJ, 14 March 2013)

56The submissions of the Crown were that the Applicant's offending required the imposition of a custodial sentence.

57This ground is without substance. If any authority is needed for that conclusion - and it is not - the authority may be found in the numerous decisions of this Court eschewing arguments to the effect that a decision in one case demonstrates or constitutes persuasive evidence of what should be the decision in another - see R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v Mungomery [2004] NSWCCA 450 at [5]; and RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235; 216 A Crim R 489 at 514 [118].

58Ground (iii)
His Honour erred by failing to provide for the pregnancy termination by Mr Khoo's partner

59The Applicant's partner was a Ms Pham. His Honour made reference to the subject of this ground when he remarked:-

Ms Pham also gave evidence before me in the sentencing proceedings. She stated that she first became aware in October 2011 that the offender was being investigated by ASIC. She said, ""This news came as a shock to me as it was out of character for John."" Ms Pham stated that in November 2011 she became aware the offender resigned from RBC because of the ASIC investigation. She said that at that time she discovered she had fallen pregnant with the offender and she states that the combination of the unplanned pregnancy, the ASIC investigation and the offender losing his job caused her significant emotional and mental distress. She states that in December 2011, faced with the uncertainty of the offender's predicament and the fact that he lost his job with RBC, she made the difficult decision to have a termination of her pregnancy. She states this was a very traumatic, stressful and saddening process to deal with. She states that she was scared of facing the prospect of raising child alone.

Of course I am required under s 16A (2)(p) of the Crimes Act to take into account the effect of the sentence on the offender's family and dependants. While I have every sympathy for Ms Pham and for the offender in relation to the decision she made, I do not regard the fact that Ms Pham made a free and considered decision to terminate her pregnancy because she was fearful of facing the prospect of raising a child alone as a matter which should mitigate the sentence.

60The conclusion was one reasonably open to his Honour. Particularly is this so once it is recognized that the reference in s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act to ""the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependents"" should be read as if it were preceded by the words ""in an exceptional case"" - R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; (2002) 134 A Crim R 286 at [31]; R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 at [93].

61This ground fails.

62Ground (iv)
His Honour erred by placing undue emphasis that the fact that the offences involved tipping

63This ground also is without substance. His Honour placed no such undue emphasis.

64Certainly his Honour referred to the differences between tipping and insider trading and pointed out that the Applicant's offences involved a gross breach of trust and that the victims of conduct such as his included the sellers who sold at prices lower than if they had been fully informed and the investing public generally because it undermined the integrity of and public confidence in the investment market. His Honour went on to express agreement with a submission of the Crown that ""one of the significant vices of tipping offences is that the tipper loses control of the inside information and creates a risk that it will be further disseminated to other persons"" and that therefore tipping can be potentially more damaging to the securities market than an insider who conducts illicit trades himself.

65There was no error in such an Honour's approach.

66Ground (v)
His Honour failed to have regard to the principles of parity.

67The foundation for this ground lies in the sentence imposed on Mr Tan for the offence of insider trading whilst in possession of the information the subject of count 3 against the Applicant. The sentence imposed on Mr Tan was one of 200 hours community service and a fine of $40,000. Mr Tan was also ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty of $39,820 (his profit). It was Marien DCJ who imposed this sentence and indeed his Honour referred to it in the course of his remarks.

68Although the Applicant passed on and Mr Tan received and used the same information, the charges against them were different and they were not co-offenders. The matter is thus not one of parity but proportionality. Nevertheless I accept that the sentence on Mr Tan is relevant.

69However there is a significant difference between the circumstances of the 2 offenders. Mr Tan was not guilty of the breach of trust or requirement for confidentiality that the Applicant was. Mr Tan, whilst his own trading may have had some, probably immeasurable, impact of the market, did not create the risk to the market that the Applicant's conduct was calculated to create. 

70Thirdly, because it is their conduct that creates the unfairness and other problems of insider trading, I would regard the need for general deterrence of persons situated as the Applicant was as greater than in the case of persons such as Mr Tan.

71Fourthly, because the Applicant was being sentenced for 4 offences, it would not have been appropriate to impose on him the same type of sentence as that imposed on Mr Tan. Indeed his Honour referred to this fact as one that led to the need for a full time custodial sentence.

72This ground also fails.

73Ground (vi)
His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the fact that the offender tipped persons who were: -

(a) not of a familial identity,

(b) in financial need.

74His Honour's remarks relevant to this ground included the following:-

In my view, the fact that the offender acted with a motive or hope for financial gain by others, in this case his close friends and not himself, does not reduce the criminality of his conduct. The offence of communicating inside information is not primarily directed towards the making of unfair profits through insider trading but at maintaining public trust in a fair transparent investment market: See R v Fysh (No 4) [2012] NSWSC 1587 per McCallum J at [47].

75And later:-

The fact that the offences were not motivated by personal greed on the part of the offender cannot in my view lead to any significant mitigation of penalty.

The Crown submits and I accept that the offender was motivated by a desire that his friends Tan and Luong would financially benefit from his breach of trust and breach of his confidentially agreement with his employer.

Accordingly, the fact that the offender nor his family derived any financial gain from these offences does not in my view reduce his criminal culpability. (sic)

76The only evidence that either of Messrs Tan and Luong were in financial need was in fact a statement in a Pre-Sentence Report that:-

Mr Khoo presented as remorseful and regretful of his actions and decisions noting he was well aware it was wrong at the time however wanted to help two friends out who he believed were experiencing some financial hardship at the time.

77Given the passages from the Remarks on sentence that I have quoted, it simply cannot be said that his Honour failed in the respects that are the subject of this ground. His Honour did have regard to the Applicant's apparent motivation and lack of family benefit.

78However on the assumption that the complaint is really that his Honour did not regard the matters relied on as mitigating factors, I am still of the view that this ground fails. I can accept that, as was said in R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [48] that ""The distinction between an offence committed for motives of personal greed and committed for the benefit of some other person is real. This is not to say that such a circumstance is exculpatory, rather it can indicate a less serious level of criminality as it did in this case."" However, that is not to say that the commission of offences for the benefit of others is a mitigatory factor. The statement is equally consitent with greed as a motivating factor being aggravating.

79Primarily the Applicant's criminality is to be judged by comparing what he did against the statutory proscription. I see no error in his Honour's approach.

80Ground (vii)
Given his Honour imposed a sentence of full time imprisonment and Mr Khoo had cooperated with ASIC and the Crown a discount ought to have been allowed for the more difficult custodial environment.

81A discount for co-operation with the authorities is generally intended to reflect all of the consequences of that co-operation. There is a significant risk of double counting if the sentence is reduced on account of such co-operation and then some further amelioration of the sentence given on account of a more difficult custodial environment. There is nothing in his Honour's remarks on sentence to indicate that in deciding upon the discount he allowed, he did not take into account the notorious more difficult custodial environment which the Applicant might well suffer.

82This ground fails. 

83Ground (viii)
The sentences were manifestly excessive. 

84The principal submission under this ground was that a sentence of full time custody was inappropriate. In support reference was made to other cases where a non-custodial sentence had been imposed

85Before turning to that submission it should be noted that the Applicant had no prior convictions of any significance and that his Honour accepted that the Applicant was genuinely remorseful and had excellent prospects of rehabilitation and that there had been delay in the final disposition of the matter, delay for which the Applicant was not responsible

86Among the cases to which the Court's attention was directed were R v Dalzell [2011] NSWSC 454; R v O'Brien [2011] NSWSC 1553; R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 and DPP v Lindskog [2013] VCC (unreported).

87In R v Dalzell, the offender, without subterfuge, purchased some $40,000 worth of shares in a company about which he had acquired inside information whilst working for an organisation involved in a possible takeover of that company. At the time of offending the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed was 5 years. Hall J concluded that there had been no ""gross abuse"" of highly confidential information, that although the offender must have been aware that his actions were wrong, he was not mindful of the serious criminality of his act, and that the case was towards the lower end of the range of insider trading offences. His Honour sentenced the offender to 2 years imprisonment to be served by way of Intensive Corrections Order.

88In R v O'Brien, the offender committed 4 offences by causing a superannuation fund of which he was a trustee to purchase shares in companies concerning which he had insider information. The relevant beneficiary of the transactions was the offender's mother. The amount invested totalled some $174,700 and a profit of some $54,700 was derived. The offender was aware of the legal prohibitions against insider trading. He had no prior convictions and otherwise a strong subjective case. His offending had imposed significant financial pressure on his family

89The offences were committed during the period 30 June 2010 and 11 January 2011. The maximum period of imprisonment to which the offender rendered himself liable was 10 years for the fourth offence but 5 years for each of the earlier offences. The parties and Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) approached the 4 offences as constituting a single episode of criminality. His Honour took the view that the objective seriousness of the offences was at the lower end of the range and imposed 4 sentences each of 2 years imprisonment to be served concurrently. His Honour said that he did not regard a custodial penalty as appropriate and directed that the sentences be served by Intensive Corrections Order.

90In R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 the offender committed 9 offences by trading in shares and CFDs relating to companies in respect of which his employer held confidential information. Some of the trading was done in the offender's own name and some, for their benefit, in the names of relatives. The trading occurred during the period 20 November 2009 and 23 November 2010. The offender was aware that his actions in accessing the information and then trading with it contravened his employer's policies and were illegal. The trading realised a profit of some $23,800 for the offender and $26,300 for his relatives. Some $371,000 in all was invested.

91At the time of sentence the offender was 29, had no prior criminal history and had a strong subjective case. Johnson J sentenced the offender to concurrent imprisonment for 1 year for each of the offences. The sentences on counts 1 to 5 were concurrent. Those on counts 6 to 9 were also concurrent but accumulated on the sentences for count 1 to 5. The sentences were directed to be served by way of Intensive Corrections Order.

92On appeal, this Court held that Johnson J had not erred in concluding that the trading on behalf of the offender's relatives in an attempt to restore his family's fortunes was a factor operating in his favour. However the appeal was allowed, the Court holding that, given the nature and seriousness of the offender's criminality, the ICO did not adequately meet the principle of general deterrence. The sentences imposed were of 15 months for counts 1 to 5 and 12 months for counts 6 to 9. The sentences for counts 1 to 5 wee directed to be served concurrently. The sentences on counts 6 to 9 were also made concurrent with each other but directed to commence 9 months after the sentences on counts 1 to 5. A direction was made that the offender was to be conditionally released after 12 months.

93In DPP v Lindskog the offender was charged with 4 offences relating to the purchase of shares in a company in resect of which the offender held confidential information concerning possible takeovers of that company. The offences took place over the period 14 March to 3 June 2011. the total cost of the purchases was some $172,000 and resulted in a profit of some $25,600.

94The offender had a strong subjective case and his Honour seems to have accepted that the offending occurred in the context of the offender having been unable to find a remunerative job, having growing financial pressures, having been in fear of being unable to support his family and, while knowing he was close to the line, convinced himself that he was still operating within the law. The sentence imposed on the first count was a pecuniary penalty of $15,000. The sentences imposed on the other counts were each of 6 months imprisonment accumulated so as to total an effective 12 months. However there was also a direction that the offender was to be forthwith released on a recognisance release order to be of good behaviour for 18 months. 

95It is apparent that the sentence imposed on the Applicant was more severe than in the cases just mentioned. However, as has been said on many occasions, sentencing is a discretionary exercise and while a judge should have regard to earlier sentences as a guide - Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 at [54] - such earlier decisions are not a straightjacket into which a new sentence must fit. Judges may legitimately differ as to, inter alia, the objective seriousness of an offence, the degree of importance that should be given to general deterrence and as to the nature of the sentence appropriate to meet that importance.

96In this case Marien DCJ referred expressly in a little detail to R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 and R v O'Brien [2011] NSWSC 1553, differing as he was entitled to do, with the conclusion of Hoeben J as to the objective serious of the offending in that case. 

97As counsel for the Applicant urged in support of ground 1, there was unchallenged evidence in the case that:-

...insider trading offences are generally very difficult to detect, investigate and prove beyond reasonable doubt.

98Similar statements are to be found in Hartman v R [2011] NSWCCA 261 at [96] and R v Rivkin [2003] NSWSC 447 at [44].

99Given the importance to the securities market generally of its integrity and the importance to those involved in significant transactions in that market of being able to keep confidential information concerning imminent or potential transactions, the difficulty to which reference was made means that general deterrence must be given substantial weight. 

100And the need for such deterrence argues for full time custody - see R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442; R v Hinton (2002) 134 A Crim R 286. True it is that in those cases the contrast was between full time custody and a suspended sentence but they make the point that a strong need for general deterrence argues for full time custody. While undoubtedly many sentences of other than full time custody involve more than the proverbial slap on the wrist, such sentences all have within them an element of leniency and are calculated to not have the same deterrent effect as does full time custody. 

101While in this case there were undoubtedly factors arguing for leniency, it must also be remembered that the Applicant's conduct in each offence amounted to deliberate criminality in full knowledge of that fact and that such conduct was repeated. In my view Marien DCJ was well entitled to impose a sentence of full time custody. 

102The question then arises as to the length of the sentences, individually and overall. It was pointed out that the sentences of 9 months on counts 1 and 2 if after a discount of the order of 40% indicates a starting point of 15 months and the sentences of 1 year and 8 months after a discount of the order of 30% indicates a starting point of the order of 2 years and 5 months. It was submitted that these periods were unduly high when compared with the maximum sentences of 5 years and 10 years respectively.

103The matter is complicated because of the concurrency of the sentences imposed by his Honour. I accept that a similar approach has been taken in the earlier cases to which I have referred but certainly in this case I find his Honour's approach impossible to reconcile with the decision of the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610. Even if there was some commonality in motive the criminality in each of the Applicant's offences was distinct from the criminality in the others.

104Considered in isolation I think that the sentence imposed for the Applicant's first offence was high, indeed manifestly excessive for a first offender. However, were I disposed to interfere with it, I would then partially accumulate on it what I think is appropriate for the Applicant's second offence. The result would not be less than the 9 months term that Marien DCJ imposed for these offences. I would take a similar approach to the sentences on counts 3 and 4 although the principle of totality would operate to limit the total sentence. However, again, the effective sentence would not be less than the 23 months with an effective 14 months non-parole period that Marien DCJ imposed.

105Neither party sought that the Court adopt the approach referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph and the issue not having been raised for the Court's determination I am content to ignore it. 

106In the result, because I think that the length of the ultimate sentence imposed by Marien DCJ was within the legitimate exercise of his sentencing discretion I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

2763063,Flanagan v R [2013] NSWCCA 320,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
On 15 March 2012, Kylie Anne Flanagan (the appellant) was convicted by a jury of wounding Joshua Wood (the complainant) with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 33(1)(a) and of affray, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 93C(1). 
The appellant appealed against her conviction on each count on the following grounds:
(1) A miscarriage of justice had been occasioned by the failure on the part of the trial judge to leave self-defence to the jury;
(2) A miscarriage of justice had been occasioned by the failure on the part of the trial judge to explain the legal consequences of an accidental wounding;
(3) A miscarriage of justice had been occasioned by the trial judge's evidential analysis in the summing up that there was ""nothing to suggest"" that the acts that were said to constitute the affray were lawful; and
(4) The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory.
Pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4, the appellant required leave to raise grounds 1, 2 and 3.
The Court dismissed the appeal.
Held by the Court (Beazley P, Fullerton and Campbell JJ): 
(1) In respect of (1):Leave under r 4 to raise ground 1 of the appeal was refused because had the appellant sought a direction on self defence at trial, the trial judge would and should have refused it: [93]. The elements of the defence of self defence in the Crimes Act 1900, s 418 were not satisfied by the evidence in this case: [86]-[93].
(2) In respect of (2):Leave under r 4 to raise ground 2 was refused because the ground involved an attempt by the appellant to argue matters before the Court that were not issues in the trial, did not have a basis in the evidence and amounted to an attempt to run a different case on appeal: [113].
(3) In respect of (3):Leave under r 4 to raise ground 3 of the appeal was refused: [127]. In the context of the trial judge's direction, her Honour did not say that there was nothing to suggest that the appellant's actions were lawful: [119]. The trial judge was not under an obligation to direct the jury in respect of self defence or the citizen's right to arrest: [121]-[126].
(4) In respect of (4):Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, the Court was satisfied ""upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"" that the appellant deliberately inflicted the wound sustained by the complainant: [153].
Applied: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493.






			Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 15 March 2012, Kylie Anne Flanagan (the appellant) was convicted after trial of wounding Joshua Wood (the complainant) with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 33(1)(a) and of affray, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 93C(1).  The maximum penalty under s 33(1)(a) is 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  The maximum penalty under s 93C(1) is 10 years imprisonment.
2On 28 June 2012, the appellant was sentenced on the wounding charge to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of 10 months to commence on 22 June 2012 and to expire on 21 April 2013 and a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months.  A fixed term of 8 months was imposed for the affray charge to date from 22 June  2012. 
3On 25 February 2013, the appellant was granted bail by this Court as provided for by the Bail Act 1978, s 30. 
4The appellant has appealed against her conviction on each count.  There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.  Four grounds of appeal are relied upon:
Ground 1:  A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the failure on the part of the trial judge to leave self-defence to the jury.
Ground 2:  A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the failure on the part of the trial judge to explain the legal consequences of an accidental wounding. 
Ground 3:  A miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the trial judge's evidential analysis in the summing up that there was ""nothing to suggest"" that the acts that were said to constitute the affray were lawful. 
Ground 4:  The verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory.
The case at trial in summary 
5At about 2.15 am on 27 May 2010, the appellant's younger brother, Jason Wilson, was involved in a fight with the complainant in Hunter Street, Newcastle.  Both men were intoxicated.  A security guard intervened and the two men were separated.  Somewhere in the order of 30 minutes later, at another location on Hunter Street, the same two men were involved in a second fight, by which time the appellant had joined her brother.  She also became involved in the second fight.  It was the Crown case that the appellant stabbed the complainant in the chest with a knife in the course of the fight.  The second fight was captured on CCTV. 
6It was the Crown case that the CCTV footage showed the appellant armed with a weapon of some kind which she thrust at or in the direction of the complainant, and that the same footage also showed her participation in the affray charged as the second count on the indictment.  It was also the Crown case that the surrounding circumstances, including:  the timing of the fight;  the wound with which the complainant presented within minutes of the fight;  the police investigation of the crime scene;  and the medical evidence, rendered the Crown case that she inflicted the stab wound as the only reasonable conclusion open on all the evidence.  No weapon was located by investigating police.  
7The police located a jumper and shirt in the gutter close to the where the Crown alleged the stabbing occurred.  There was no blood on the shirt or jumper.  The complainant identified the jumper as his and that he was wearing it on the night he was stabbed.  He could not remember the shirt.  The Crown relied on the absence of blood on the shirt and jumper to counter a suggestion that the wounding had occurred prior to the confrontation in which the appellant became involved and the complainant's clothing had been removed.
8The wound suffered by the complainant was described by Dr Ashour, the physician who treated him at the John Hunter Hospital, as an open chest wound in the right lower chest with a right side pneumothorax with mild hemothorax (that is, a wound involving a breach of the covering of the lungs but without significant haemorrhage into the pleura).  It was the doctor's evidence that the edges of the wound were not corrugated or jagged and likely to have been the result of a single penetrating injury with a sharp object.  Given the appearance of the wound, he thought the probabilities favoured it having been caused by knife or other sharp object.  When he was asked under cross-examination whether that would include a piece of broken glass, he thought it possible, but that venturing an opinion as to what might have been the type of ""sharp object"" was beyond his expertise.  
9The doctor  was not asked and no evidence was otherwise led to suggest how the single penetrating chest wound might have been caused by a piece of broken glass, whether wielded by an assailant or by the complainant falling onto a piece broken glass.  There is no mention in the evidence of broken glass at the scene and no questions were asked of the police who designated it a crime scene as to whether they saw broken glass at the scene.  
10The appellant contended that it was part of her case at trial that she involved herself in the fight between her brother and the complainant to get the complainant arrested, and then as the violence escalated to stop the fight.  There was no evidence of the former and the latter contention depended upon the view taken of the CCTV footage.
11There was no blood on the appellant when she was spoken to by police later that day or in the vehicle in which she was driven from the scene.  Police did, however, identify a trail of the complainant's blood which commenced on Hunter street at a location proximate to where, on the Crown case, he was stabbed and trailed into Steel Street where he knocked on the door of a brothel and where he was later treated by ambulance officers.  His clothing which had been left at the scene of the stabbing and seized by police was not damaged in any area contiguous with his chest wound.  The CCTV footage showed that his shirt and sweater were pulled off by Mr Wilson and before the involvement of the appellant a minute or so later. 
12The appellant gave evidence that she was not armed with a knife when she joined her brother, but that when she got out of the car she did pick up a stick which she found lying on the ground, as she followed her brother towards where he confronted the complainant.  She said she only physically involved herself in the fight in an attempt to break it up and that she dropped the stick as she tried to place herself between the two men with that intention.  To the extent that the CCTV footage was capable of revealing the course of the fight (about which there was considerable controversy at trial and on the appeal), the appellant submitted that it was consistent with her case and, further, that what the Crown submitted was a knife she was thrusting at the complainant was probably the stick that she had picked up and that she subsequently dropped.  It formed no part of the Crown case that the wounding was caused by a stick.  
13It was also the defence case at trial that it was a reasonable possibility that the complainant's chest injury was inflicted before the fight that was captured on CCTV, or after the fight and before he presented at the door of a brothel in Steel Street 120 m away bleeding from the chest.  It was also the defence case that it was a reasonable possibility that the wound was sustained during the course of the fight either because her brother had a knife (of which she was unaware) or because the complainant fell onto something sharp when he was on the ground in the course of the fight. 
14The complainant was cross-examined to suggest that his chest wound may have been sustained in a confrontation with a person or persons other than those he was fighting with in the CCTV footage, either before that fight or after it and before he went to the brothel in Steel Street.  Other than the fight with Mr Wilson in which the security guard had intervened earlier that morning and the fight captured on CCTV in which the appellant and her brother were involved, he denied a violent encounter with anyone else. 
15In meeting the defence case that the complainant was stabbed intentionally by someone else before the fight in which the appellant and her brother were involved (and that the wound had partially occluded and then reopened in the fight), the Crown placed particular reliance on the fact that the complainant's jumper and shirt showed no sign of having been cut or torn and that on examination of those items there were no areas of deposited blood. Dr Ashour was unable to comment as to the potential for the complainant's wound to have occluded and then reopened under vigorous exercise (as suggested by defence counsel at trial) given the passage of time between his treatment of the complainant and the trial.  He did, however, conceive of the theoretical possibility of this occurring but was unable to comment on the possibility of it having occurred in the circumstances under consideration. 
16By the time of the appellant's trial, Mr Wilson had been convicted of affray arising out of the fight with the complainant.  He was called as a witness by the Crown in the appellant's trial.  In his evidence in chief he denied inflicting the knife wound.  This was not the subject of cross-examination by the appellant's counsel.  His evidence was, however, the subject of a warning under the Evidence Act 1995, s 165. 
The evidence at trial in detail 
The first fight 
17Jason Wilson gave evidence that after leaving the Silk Hotel some time shortly after 2 am on 27 May 2010, and in the course of making his way towards another local nightclub on foot, he was attacked by a man who demanded he hand over money and his phone.  He said the man tackled him to the ground where he was punched and his head ""repeatedly slammed"" into the ground.  He also believed that he had been jabbed with a syringe, because of a ""stinging"" sensation on his hand and because the man who had just attacked him looked like ""a drongo"".  
18In response to his call for help, a security guard who saw the fight from his car intervened and separated the two men.  The security guard gave evidence that this was at about 2.15 am.  The security guard said that the younger man (who, on the evidence, was Jason Wilson) was ""shaken up, really scared"".  He had the impression that the older man (the complainant) was homeless, given his ""scruffy"" appearance.  He said the older man was wearing greyish coloured tracksuit pants that appeared to be falling down as he was walking away.  He said the older man's knuckles were bleeding and that he was mumbling and not making much sense. 
19Jason Wilson declined an offer to be driven to the police station, saying that he had friends and family up the road.  He walked on to Fanny's nightclub where he telephoned his mother, Vicki Wilson.  He told her that he thought he had been stabbed with a syringe and beaten up.  She gave evidence that her son was ""very upset"" and that she told him she would come and pick him up.  She then telephoned the appellant and told her that her brother had been bashed and stabbed with a syringe and that she did not want to drive into town alone to pick him up.  Ms Wilson then drove the short distance from her home at Wallsend to collect the appellant before driving into Newcastle.  
20After collecting her son from the nightclub, Ms Wilson said she turned right into Hunter Street intending to drive back to Wallsend.  She said her son then said, ""[t]here he is"", and told her to stop the car, whereupon her son and the appellant got out of the car.
21Meanwhile, according to the evidence, the complainant had visited a nearby brothel, The Asian Star, where he asked for and was given a glass of water (which he refused), before going to the residence of a friend, David Wilkinson, on Hunter Street.  He went upstairs and asked his friend for a drink of water.  He gave evidence they sat down and talked about the fight, after which he returned to the brothel for a short time before deciding to return to the Silk Hotel to find his friends.
22Mr Wilkinson gave evidence confirming that he received a visit from his friend, the complainant, in the early hours of the morning at premises in Hunter Street, where he lived in an Arts Association.  He said the complainant was ""upset and intoxicated"".  He had abrasions on his hand and complained of a lump on the back of his head.  On a scale of intoxication from zero to ten, he assessed him to be ""about an 8, he was standing drunk, he was pretty drunk"".  The complainant remained with Mr Wilkinson for about half an hour, consuming a couple of glasses of water before he left.
The second fight 
Jason Wilson's evidence
23Jason Wilson gave evidence in chief that he jumped out of his mother's car while it was still moving slowly in order to confront the man who had attacked him earlier.  He could not recall if the appellant also got out of the car.  He claimed he said to the man (the complainant), ""Remember me?"" and, as the man came towards him, he said to him, ""Why did you do that last time?"".  He said the man kept coming and so he ""struck out"" at the man and punched him once.  He said his mother then told him to get back into the car, but he chased the man around the corner.  He said that by this time the appellant was out of the car screaming at him and telling him to get back in the car.  He said he ended up getting into the car.  He said when he got back into the car there was a man in the front seat that his mother had asked for help.  He said his mother then took him to the hospital.  
24The Crown applied and was granted leave to cross-examine Jason Wilson under the Evidence Act, s 38 given the conflict between his evidence and what was shown on the CCTV footage as to his involvement in the fight and the involvement of the appellant.  In cross-examination by the Crown, he agreed he got out of the car and chased the man who he eventually caught.  It was then put to him that he moved towards the man who bent over to protect himself.  He said that he grabbed the man by the shirt and that the man was bending over at that time which is how his jumper came off.  He said despite the CCTV footage showing his sister, the appellant, present at that time, she was trying to break up the fight.  It was put to him that the appellant made physical contact with the man on at least two occasions and stabbed him in the course of one of those occasions, having moved around him so she was able to be in contact with him.  He denied that occurred.  He denied that she had a knife. 
25Under the protection of a certificate under the Evidence Act, s 128, he also agreed kicking the man whilst he was on the ground.  When it was put to him that his sister pursued the man even after he managed to free himself from the fight, and that this was inconsistent with her trying to break it up, he said that he and his sister chased after the man with the intention of holding him until the police arrived.  The Crown then cross-examined  him  by reference to the CCTV footage with a view to demonstrating that the footage did not show that he chased after the man and that his evidence was given with a view to assisting his sister, who he knew did chase after the man, which he denied.
26Under cross-examination by defence counsel, he  said  that he heard his sister screaming ""get off him, get in the car""  as she was pulling on the back of his sweater, but that he continued with the attack despite her efforts to pull them apart.  He agreed that he got out of the car on impulse when he saw the man and that he did not discuss with his sister what he was going to do.  He said that he had his eyes on his sister during the fight but not the entire time.  He said when he was looking at her he did not see anything in her hands and he was confident he did not see a knife.  
27Mr Wilson was also asked:  ""Did you on the night of 27 May 2010 stab [the complainant]?""  He answered:  ""No"".  This evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.
The complainant's evidence
28In relation to the second fight, the complainant gave evidence that he was on Hunter Street walking towards the Silk Hotel when he heard the sound of car tyres screeching followed by a male voice screaming and yelling, ""That's the bloke who stabbed me with the syringe"".  He said he saw a car full of people and ""got scared"" and began to run away.  He became aware of a male person running beside him screaming and yelling to the other people to hurry.  He said he ran a few hundred metres up the road before he became out of breath.  He said he started wrestling with a man and tried to protect himself (indicating in the witness box with both hands beside his head).  He said he heard screaming and yelling, including from a female voice which he described as ""a real crazy voice"".  He gave evidence of being beaten with ""hits coming from everywhere"".  He thought he might have then dropped to the ground.  He described ""getting winded, like no energy"" and feeling that he was unable to defend himself.
29He said that he then moved away towards the Silk Hotel but it was closed, so he went to a brothel called Cloud 9 on Steel Street.  He said he went through the entrance door and then pressed the electric buzzer beside a second door.  When a woman came out he complained about being bashed.  He said he had not noticed that he had been wounded until she asked him where the blood was coming from. He denied in cross-examination that he could have fallen between Hunter Street and the brothel on Steel Street, although he accepted in cross-examination that on the night he said to the woman at the brothel that he thought he tripped over whilst he was ""trying to get away from them"" while they were trying to beat him up.  As the appellant relied upon the complainant's evidence of tripping in support of ground 2, it is appropriate to refer to the evidence the complainant gave on this in his cross-examination:  
""Q.  Why would you say to the lady at the brothel 'I think I tripped arse over head while I was trying to get away from them', if you hadn't tripped over?A.  I might have tripped over when I was getting away from them, like actually, when I was getting beaten up, trying to push away from them to get away.""  
30The complainant denied that as he ran around the corner into Steel Street he was ""so pumped and aggressive that [he] would hit out at anybody that [he] came into contact with"".  The complainant denied any further confrontation with any person in the foyer area of the brothel or between the corner of Hunter Street and the brothel.
Evidence of eye-witnesses
31Kay Laming gave evidence that at about 2.50 am on 27 May 2010, whilst working as a receptionist at Cloud 9, she heard the front door of the premises slam shut and as she approached the security door she could see a man in the foyer who seemed distressed.  There was blood on his forearms and his chest.  He was wearing tracksuit pants and one shoe.  He was not wearing a shirt.  He said something like, ""I think someone stabbed me, what sort of a person goes around stabbing people"".  Ms Laming noticed that he had a cut on one side of his body about 2 cm long and which ""looked a bit deep"".  He was bleeding quite badly and he agreed she should call an ambulance.  In cross-examination, Ms Laming denied that at any stage the man mentioned having fallen over.
32Peter Milne gave evidence that at about 2.30 am, he was walking towards the Silk Hotel when he observed an incident on Hunter Street about 10-20 m from the intersection of Hunter and Steel Streets.  He said he saw a man lying on the ground being kicked by another man.  He said that there were ""a couple of girls"" standing beside the man on the ground.  One of the females was screaming at a man with no shirt to ""get off him, leave him alone"".  He said she was ""dressed up like she was going out"".  The other female was blonde.  
33He said the incident appeared to end when the man doing the kicking saw a car pull up and ran into the brothel.  The car drove around the corner.  Mr Milne approached the open front passenger window of the car and said to the driver, a middle aged woman, ""Are you alright? Can I help you?"".  The woman asked him to get in the car.  Mr Milne got into the front passenger seat followed by the man who had been kicked and the female who had been screaming, ""Get off him"", in the back seat.  The car drove down Steel Street and left into King Street.  The female passenger asked, ""What's this bloke doing in the car?"" and the driver replied, ""He's helping me"".  Mr Milne asked what had happened.  The female passenger told him that the male had been attacked.  The male passenger agreed that is what had happened and showed Mr Milne his hand, saying, ""I got stabbed by a syringe"".  Mr Milne saw a puncture mark and some blood on the man's hand.  The female passenger then asked Mr Milne to get out of the car.  He did so, suggesting to the driver that she go to the police.  Mr Milne then caught a taxi on King Street to Newcastle police station. 
34In cross-examination by the Crown, pursuant to leave granted under the Evidence Act, s 38, Mr Milne was played excerpts from the CCTV footage.  He agreed that it showed the man with the hoodie (Jason Wilson) kicking the man with no shirt on (the complainant).  He agreed that he could be mistaken when he said that it was the man without the shirt who was kicking the man with the hoodie.  Mr Milne also agreed that one female, not two, appears on the CCTV footage near the shirtless man and that she was wearing jeans, joggers and a top rather than ""going out"" clothes.  Mr Milne agreed that he may have been mistaken that there was a second female present on the street during the incident.  He did not mention a second female in his statement to police.
35Mr Milne also agreed in cross-examination that the incident he observed occurred on the footpath and not in the gutter, as shown in one part of the footage.  Mr Milne did not see any sign of an injury or blood on the chest of the shirtless man.
36Mr Milne's evidence was not referred to by the trial judge in the summing up.  No complaint is made in that regard.
37Amy Becker gave evidence that she was driving home from work west along Hunter Street on 27 May 2010 when she saw one man beating up another man, who was covered in blood.  The men were on the footpath just before the Silk Hotel.  When she was approximately 15-20 m from the fight, Ms Becker pulled over to the side of the road and used her mobile phone to call police.  
38She observed one man repetitively punching the other man, in the head and on his body.  He buckled over.  The first thing she saw in any detail was a female trying to stop the man beating up the man who was covered in blood.  She appeared to be breaking the fight up by pushing the man who was not covered in blood away and standing in between the two men.  Ms Becker heard the female say, ""Stop"".  It appeared to her that:
""... everything had already happened, I just caught the tail end of it because the fight was trying to be broken up and the guy was in a white shirt, but it wasn't really white any more it was covered in blood.""  
39The two men were closer to Ms Becker than the female.  They had their backs towards her at one stage and the female was on the other side of them.  She then saw that a car pulled over alongside the incident.  The police officer she was speaking to on the phone asked her to read out the number plate twice.
40Ms Becker saw the man covered in blood fall to the ground and become more and more covered in blood as the other man continued to kick him while he was on the ground.  Ms Becker then saw the female push the man doing the kicking, causing him to fall backwards onto the ground with his hands out to break the fall.  The man covered in blood used the opportunity to get up and try to run away onto Steel Street.  He was followed by the other man and the female out of Ms Becker's vision.  The car parked alongside the incident also sped around the corner onto Steel Street.
41At this time Ms Becker was still on the phone to the police officer.  She was asked if she could drive closer so that she could make further observations.  She agreed.  As she was stopped at the lights she saw two people get into the car that had pulled up and saw the car speed left around the corner of Steel Street into King Street, towards the beach.  She turned onto Steel Street and saw the car parked just past the King Street Hotel.  She said she saw the man who had been beating up the other man get out of the car.  She told the police officer that she did not want to assist further and was advised to leave.  As she drove past the car, the police officer asked he if she could see the car in her rear-view mirror and if she could repeat the number plate for a third time.  Ms Becker reversed slightly in order to see the number plate.  The car then drove past her towards the beach.  She saw the man who had got out of the car on her left, holding a discarded chair above his head as if to throw it at Ms Becker's car.  She told the police officer she was not helping any more and sped away.
42In cross-examination, Ms Becker said that she did not see the two men in physical contact with one another in the gutter or on the road.
43Ms Becker had the impression that there was blood on the white shirt because of the ""dark colouring"" and because it appeared to be wet from the heavy way it hung.
44Ms Becker denied in cross-examination that the man she saw holding the chair might not have been someone who got out of the vehicle she was watching.
The CCTV footage
45Police recovered coloured CCTV footage from an external camera mounted in 633 Hunter Street (Exh 6) between 2.30 and 3 am on 27 May 2010 and black and white CCTV footage from an external camera mounted at 621 Hunter Street covering the footpath outside that building (Exh 7).
46The following summary of the black and white footage was relied upon by the Crown at trial (and repeated on the appeal) as supporting the Crown case.  It features the appellant following behind her brother as he approaches the complainant from behind and launches an attack on him.  In the course of the attack, and as the complainant is bending over and backing up, Jason Wilson pulls the complainant's clothing over his head.  The appellant, also from behind, takes a large step to the left around her brother and swings her right arm up away from him.  At this point an object in her hand, which has the appearance of a knife, is said to be visible, silhouetted against the footpath.  The appellant continues to position herself around her brother and up next to the complainant's right who, by this time, has nothing on his upper body.  The appellant moves as if to make physical contact with the complainant on at least two occasions.  The Crown invited the jury to draw the inference that it was on one of those two occasions that she stabbed the complainant.  Meanwhile, Jason Wilson is seen kicking the complainant while he is on the ground.  Shortly thereafter he is seen to disengage from the complainant and speak to a person in the car driven by his mother.  The appellant is last seen chasing the complainant as he runs away.  She is alone at this time. 
47The appellant and the complainant move out of the picture while Mr Wilson is still seen at his mother's car appearing to speak with her.  
48In the coloured footage which is Exh 6, Mr Wilson is then seen running.  The appellant is first seen chasing the complainant.  Mr Wilson is not in the footage at that stage.  Mr Wilson is then seen running after them.
The police investigation 
49Police attended the brothel in Steel Street at 3.05 am at about the same time as the ambulance arrived.  At that time, the complainant was lying in the foyer floor, clutching the right side of his ribs.  There was blood on his torso, the floor and the wall.  He was taken to the hospital.
50Police remained at the crime scene until the crime scene officer arrived.  A crime scene was established around the entrance to the brothel and for about 20 m along the footpath leading to the brothel.  About 20 minutes later, a second crime scene was established on Hunter Street after blood was noticed on the corner of Hunter and Steel Streets and clothing was observed near the gutter outside 621 Hunter Street.  Small amounts of blood were noted leading from the shirt and jumper (later identified as belonging to the complainant) along the footpath to the brothel. 
51A forensic investigator examined the crime scene which ultimately encompassed approximately 64 m of Hunter Street, from 621 Hunter Street to the intersection with Steel Street, and approximately 68.7 m of Steel Street from that intersection to 9 Steel Street. 
52An area of apparent blood staining in the gutter in the vicinity of the shirt, jumper and telegraph pole was marked D by the police.  (There was no blood located north of that marker in Hunter Street.)  Further apparent areas of blood stains appeared at crime scene markers E-V which, on the Crown case, loosely followed the path that the complainant took in fleeing from his assailants to the brothel.  A computer aided diagram, drawn to scale, of the intersection of Hunter and Steel Streets showing crime scene markers, items and locations of interest was tendered at the trial (Exh 13).  The forensic investigator did not state in his evidence that he had found any sharp object, nor was he cross-examined on whether he had found anything or looked for anything on the ground that might have caused the wound.  
53A certificate by an analyst employed at the Division of Analytical Laboratories was tendered (Exh 5).  The analyst received a buccal sample from the complainant, together with swabs taken at markers D, M and V at the crime scene.  The swabs from the crime scene markers D, M and V tested positive for blood.  DNA testing revealed that the complainant has the same DNA profile as the DNA recovered from those swabs .
54At about 8.40 am, police attended Vicki Wilson's home to speak with Mr Wilson.  They later returned to the premises and searched Vicki Wilson's car, but found nothing of interest.  Later, Jason Wilson attended Waratah Police Station where he was interviewed and underwent a forensic procedure.  Both Vicki Wilson and the appellant also participated in electronically recorded interviews on 27 May 2010.  At that stage, both women were informed that they were not suspects, not under arrest and were free to leave at any time.  
55The appellant was charged with the offences in respect of which she was tried on 30 July 2010. 
The appellant's evidence 
56The appellant's evidence as to the circumstances in which she came to be her mother's car in Newcastle in the early morning of 27 May 2010 was generally coincident with her mother's evidence and the evidence of her brother.  She said when her brother directed his mother to stop the car in Hunter Street her only concern was to follow him.  She said that when she started to run, she was thinking:
""... if there was anything that was going to happen I was there to sort of stop Jason or you know both of them intervene in anything else that had occurred because of the earlier incident"".  
57She stated that ""I probably got three metres and sort of kicked a stick as I was running and then picked that up"".  She described the stick as 30 to 40 cm in length and about as wide as a 10 cent piece. 
58She said she did not turn her mind to what sort of injury she may be able to inflict with the stick, and denied in cross-examination that she had invented picking up the stick in order to explain what she knew was shown on the CCTV footage by the time of trial. 
59The appellant said that when she reached her brother and the other man they were wrestling.  At this stage, she was still holding onto the stick.  Her brother was pulling at the man's jumper.  She was thinking that she had to get in between them to break them up.  She said she tried to push her brother back with her arm and, when that did not work, she pushed her body in front of her brother's body, moving her body to the right in the process.  She said she had to drop the stick in order to get between the two men and push them apart, using both hands.  She said she yelled out, ""Stop, stop, don't worry about it, get in the car, just leave it"".  
60She said at no stage did she punch, hit, kick or stab the complainant.  She did not have a knife with her.  She did not hit or stab the complainant with a stick or push him over. 
61The appellant said that at the point of the black and white CCTV footage in Exh 7 when her brother is seen at her mother's car and she has disappeared off the top of the screen, she was walking alongside the man telling him, ""Look, just go, get out of here"".  She said following the fight that was shown on Exh 7, when her brother subsequently caught up to where she was, he went to grab at the complainant a second time.  She said her brother lost his balance and that both ended up on the ground, with the complainant on top of her brother punching him.  She was unsure for how long they were on the ground before her brother got the complainant on to his back where he was held him down and punched in the mouth.  The appellant said she was screaming for help before her brother got up and the other man ran away.  The last time she saw the complainant he was on the corner of Hunter and Steel Streets.  She said this second incident was not shown on any CCTV footage.  At some stage during the second incident the appellant said he pulled her brother by the hood of his jumper. 
62The appellant said that at the point of the CCTV footage where the appellant is close to the bus stop sign (after emerging from the bottom right hand corner of the screen) and the complainant has his back to the glass window frontage, appearing to face the appellant directly, ""I was telling him to go and that the police would find out who he was anyway"".  The complainant had no shirt on.  The appellant did not notice any sign of blood on his chest at any stage. 
63The appellant is seen to continue along Hunter Street towards Steel Street.  Her brother is seen coming in the same direction after the appellant and the complainant have passed through.  The appellant got into her mother's car at the top of the street. 
64The appellant said by the time that she got back into her mother's car on the corner of Hunter and Steel Streets, she felt ""scared and just wanted to get out of there"".  
65During cross-examination, the appellant denied that the information concerning her brother that her mother conveyed over the telephone made her angry and denied that she armed herself with some sort of a kitchen knife or a folding knife before agreeing to accompany her mother into town to pick him up.
66She said that the idea of going to the police station on the way into Newcastle to collect her brother did not occur to her, because she thought going to the hospital was the better option in case her brother was concussed.  She agreed in cross-examination that it occurred to her it might be dangerous to get out of the car with her brother given that, according to her brother, the other man had won the previous fight.  The appellant denied that it was because of those concerns that she took the knife with her when she got out of the car.  She said that her purpose in following her brother out of the car was to identify the person that had attacked her brother earlier.  It was put to her that this impossible as she had not been present during the earlier flight.  She denied that she stabbed the complainant because she wanted to inflict really serious injury on him because she believed that he had struck her brother with a needle and had potentially infected him. 
The grounds of appeal
67Before dealing with the individual grounds of appeal, reference should be made to the principles governing grounds 1, 2 and 3, each of which requires the grant of leave pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.  That rule provides:  
""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""
68The Court will only grant leave where it is established that the error of which complaint is made led to a miscarriage of justice:  R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536;  R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at [20];  Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [170];  Carney v R [2011] NSWCCA 223; 217 A Crim R 201 at [67].  A miscarriage of justice will be demonstrated where there is a fairly open chance that the accused person would have been found not guilty of the offence.  Carney at [68].
69In Darwiche, at [170], the Court (Johnson J, McClellan CJ at CL and James J concurring) used the vernanular phrase ""armchair appeal"" to describe the situation:
""... where counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record of the trial in minute detail looking for error or possible arguments without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310 at 319-330 [40]-[45]; Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [155].""
70In Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 162 A Crim R 301 Gleeson CJ, at [9], emphasised that ""[a] criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation"", ""[a] cardinal principle"" of which is that parties are bound by the conduct of the case at trial by counsel who then appeared.  That principle was subject to considerations of fairness.  His Honour then stated that:
""... As a general rule, counsel's decisions bind the client. If it were otherwise, the adversarial system could not function. The fairness of the process is to be judged in that light. The nature of the adversarial system, and the assumptions on which it operates, will lead to the conclusion, in most cases, that a complaint that counsel's conduct has resulted in an unfair trial will be considered by reference to an objective standard, and without an investigation of the subjective reasons for that conduct.""  
71Gleeson CJ then referred to the operation of r 4 and, in particular, the issues that arise under that rule where there is a question as to whether the trial counsel's omission or failure to take a particular point was for a tactical purpose.  His Honour, after noting that the Court of Criminal Appeal was an unsatisfactory forum for determining such questions, stated, at [10]:
""... I mention the practical problems that arise in the application of r 4, because the existence of such problems is of wider significance, and bears upon the principles to be applied in resolving a question of miscarriage of justice. To the extent to which it is reasonably possible, the focus of attention should be the objective features of the trial process ... as far as justice permits, the inquiry should be objective.""  (emphasis added)
72It is also appropriate to have regard to the remarks by this Court, in Darwiche.  The Court, at [170], warned that an appeal:
""... does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on the basis of one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial.""  
Ground 1:  failure to leave self defence to the jury  
73The appellant submitted that despite it being her case at trial that she did not inflict the wound the subject of the offences charged as alternatives in counts one and two, because self defence was fairly raised on the evidence the trial judge was obliged to leave self-defence to the jury by directing them as to the constituent elements of the defence as provided for in s 418 and instructing them that the Crown was obliged to negative self defence beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict 
74As indicated, the leave of the Court is required in order for the appellant to rely upon this ground, as her counsel at trial did not seek a direction as to self defence:  Criminal Procedure Rules, r 4. 
75The evidence said to give rise to self defence included the appellant's evidence that, to the extent she had any physical involvement in the events, she did so in order to prevent the violent altercation between her brother and the complainant.  It was also submitted that self defence was raised by what was revealed  in the CCTV footage of the incident, as well as her evidence as to her state of mind at that time.  It was put on her behalf that, as she understood matters, her brother had been assaulted and stabbed with a syringe by the complainant earlier in the evening and she was present when they confronted each other a second time to ""stop Jason or both of them, intervene in anything else that occurred because of  the earlier incident"".  The appellant submitted that there was circumstantial support for her actions being defensive in the relevant sense in the evidence of two eyewitnesses who described, inter alia, the ""female"" involved in the incident calling upon the men to stop fighting. 
76The Crown submitted that the trial judge was not required to direct the jury on self defence as there was nothing in the evidence that gave rise to the issue:  Mencarious v R [2008] NSWCCA 237; 189 A Crim R 219 at [61];  Douglas v R [2005] NSWCCA 419 at [99]-[101].  The Crown also submitted that this was a rigorously run case where the appellant resisted any suggestion that she was armed with a knife, or that she wounded the complainant with a weapon of any kind, and for that reason also leave should not be granted to raise this ground (and the other grounds for which leave was required).  This last submission was, in effect, directed to the conduct of trial counsel, the inference being that the omission to seek a direction was not due to oversight or incompetence.  In this regard, it should be noted that the appellant expressly eschewed any argument that trial counsel was incompetent. The fact that counsel took a tactical decision not to raise self defence does not of itself foreclose of the obligation of the trial judge, in appropriate circumstances to leave the issue to the jury.  The question that arises on the appeal  is whether the trial judge should have left the issue to the jury such that the failure to do so has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
The law 
77The Crimes Act, s 418(1) provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence if a person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self defence.  Section 418(2)(a) provides that conduct constitutes self defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary to defend herself or himself or another person and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as the person perceives them. 
78Where self defence is left for the consideration of the jury there are three components of the defence which must be the subject of direction by the trial judge.  The trial judge is only obliged to leave the issue for the jury if there is a sufficient evidential basis for the first two elements:  (i) that the accused believes the conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another person (or for one of the other purposes identified in the section and not presently material) and (ii) that the accused carries out the conduct for that purpose (see subs (1)). The third component, that the conduct be a reasonable response in the circumstances as perceived by the accused, only falls to be considered, if the jury are satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that the conduct was carried out defensively.  The question whether the response was reasonable is determined by an objective assessment of the proportionality of the conduct that is relied upon as the defensive response of the accused to the situation as the accused perceived it:  Douglas at [79].  
79Section 419 provides that where self defence is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused did not carry out the conduct the subject of the charge in self defence.  The Crown would negative self defence if it proved beyond reasonable doubt either that the accused did not genuinely believe that it was necessary to act defensively in the relevant sense or that what was done was disproportionate to the danger ort threat as the accused perceived it.
80A trial judge has an obligation in certain circumstances to give directions to the jury, even if the matter is not raised by the defence.  The obligation arises where an issue arises on the evidence and may lead to an acquittal.  Thus in Gipp v The Queen [1998] HCA 21; 194 CLR 106 McHugh and Hayne JJ said, at 124: 
""One important exception to the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings is that a trial judge has a duty to direct the jury on any matter that could result in the acquittal of the accused even though the accused deliberately refuses to argue the point"" (citation omitted). 
81In Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 Barwick CJ said, at 117-118, that where an issue had been identified in the trial (in that case, the issue of provocation), then, if there was evidence upon which the jury could find for the accused, the trial judge had a duty to direct the jury on that issue even if the issue had not been raised by the defence.
82In Stevens v R [2005] HCA 65; 227 CLR 319 McHugh J observed, at [30], that a jury was entitled to refuse to accept the case that the Crown and the defence had respectively advanced and work out for themselves, on the evidence, what had occurred.  Whilst a jury cannot take into account a fantastical or far-fetched possibility, nonetheless, it was for the jury to determine what was reasonable in the circumstances in determining whether the Crown had established the guilt of the accused.
83In Mencarious the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, James and Fullerton JJ agreeing) observed, at [65], that the duty of a trial judge to give directions on a matter not raised by the defence only arose where the relevant issue was raised by the evidence.  Where there was evidence of a particular issue, the trial judge had a duty to give a relevant direction so that the jury could determine the matter on the evidence, according to law:  see Domican v R [1992] HCA 13; 173 CLR 555 at 561;  R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; 132 A Crim R 371 at [30].  McClellan CJ at CL added: 
""... a trial judge is not bound to direct the jury in relation to an hypothesis unless it is reasonable having regard to the evidence""  (citations omitted).
84In Douglas, the only evidence in the trial was that of the complainant and the accused (the appellant).  The appellant's case was a denial of the allegations made against him.  The appellant's evidence (at [70] of the judgment) was that he had never hit the complainant unless the complainant had hit him first.  No direction as to self defence was given nor was one sought.  Simpson J (Adams and Hoeben JJ agreeing), although commenting upon the tactical difficulties that would have faced trial counsel had such a direction been sought, nonetheless stated that he was not precluded from seeking a direction as to self defence, provided that the issue was raised on the evidence.  In her Honour's view, self defence was not raised on the evidence.  Rather, as her Honour observed: 
""99 Given that, in respect of this count, the appellant simply denied the conduct alleged against him, it is impossible to see how a direction on self-defence could rationally have been given. On what evidentiary matters was the judge to direct the jury? ... The only evidence was that of the complainant that the appellant had punched her and that of the appellant denying her evidence. There was not the slightest evidence that the complainant had initiated any altercation, whether verbal or physical, and no evidence from which any such inference could be drawn. There was no evidence on which a jury could have any conclusions as to the appellant's perception of the circumstance. 
100 While it remained for the Crown to negative a belief on his part that the conduct (that he denied) was necessary to defend himself (as distinct from conduct he engaged in by way of retaliation) nevertheless, there must be some evidential basis before an issue of self-defence may be left to the jury. S419 depends upon the issue of self-defence having been 'raised': see, e.g. Colosimo v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 854, per Johnson J; R v Nguyen (1995) 36 NSWLR 397, per Priestley JA. It was not here raised in any meaningful way. The mere reference, by the appellant in his evidence in chief, to self-defence, in lay terms, did not do that. Nor did generalised assertions that it was the complainant who initiated violence in the relationship.""
85This case is not as straightforward as the circumstances that arose for consideration in Douglas.  In that case, the appellant denied the conduct alleged against him.  In the present case, even on the appellant's version, she involved herself in the  fight between her brother and the complainant.  The question that arises is what was the nature of that involvement.  Was she trying to stop the fight that was initiated by her brother?  Was she seeking to defend her brother from an attack (or perceived attack) by the complainant?  Or was she assisting her brother to attack the complainant in retaliation for the earlier attack upon him?  
86The appellant did not give any evidence that she became involved in the fight because she believed it was necessary for her to do so to defend her brother.  The highest her evidence went was that she left the car and followed her brother in the event that it was necessary to stop any fight or to prevent any repetition of what she believed was the needle stick injury the complainant had earlier inflicted.  She submitted, however (and we accept), that s 418(2) does not require an accused to give direct evidence of belief that it was necessary in the particular circumstances to act defensively if there is a basis for that belief from other evidence or as a matter of inference from that evidence.  In this case, the appellant relied upon the evidence of Ms Becker, who observed the fight from her car and to a lesser extent the evidence of Mr Milne.  
87Ms Becker's evidence was that she came upon the fight towards its end and that the female appeared to be breaking the fight up by pushing the man who was not covered in blood away and standing in between the two men.  Ms Becker heard the female say, ""Stop"".  Ms Becker's evidence was thus limited by reason of her arriving after the fight.  Although she saw the man with blood on him, she did not see the infliction of the wound that caused the bleeding.  The weight of Mr Milne's account of the incident was undermined by the fact that he saw two females involved in the fight, which was squarely contradicted by the CCTV footage and that the man without a shirt (the complainant) was kicking the man on the ground, again contradicted by the CCTV footage.
88One thing that was clear on the CCTV footage was that the complainant was not the protagonist.  The protagonist was the appellant's brother who is seen chasing the complainant, pushing him, grappling with him, punching him, pulling his jumper off and kicking him.  That was also consistent with the evidence of the complainant.  The appellant's brother's evidence, although describing a more limited involvement, is only consistent with his being the aggressor.
89The appellant's evidence was that she was trying to break up the fight.  The appellant did not contend that her evidence was sufficient to establish the requisite belief in s 418(2) that ""the conduct"" (in this case the use of a knife were the jury to conclude that she was so armed) was necessary to defend her brother, or that there was any basis elsewhere in the evidence for her to have formed the belief that the complainant was or might be armed with a syringe when she involved herself in the fight initiated by her brother.  In our opinion, Ms Becker's evidence fell well short of addressing those deficiencies in the evidence.  Not only did she only see the end of the fight, hearing the female call out ""stop"" is entirely consistent with the appellant calling out to her brother to stop kicking the complainant, because having realised that she had stabbed the complainant, she also realised it was essential that they leave.
90Further, there was simply no evidence that would satisfy the second limb of s 418 .
91A case of self defence involves an acceptance or admission that the accused person inflicted a wound or engaged in an assault or that the jury might reason to that conclusion.  As previously said, the appellant's complaint that self defence should have been left to the jury bears the same tactical difficulties that confronted counsel in Douglas.  A case of self defence was contrary to her case that she did not have a knife or implement that could have caused the wound and that she did not stab the complainant.  Therefore, if the appellant wished to contend, as she now does, that she acted in defence of her brother, she had to:  (a) advance a case to the jury that using the knife in the manner depicted in the CCTV footage and wounding the complainant was in self defence;  (b) satisfy the trial judge that the evidence raised a question of self defence even if not positively advanced by her;  or (c) satisfy this Court that there was a miscarriage of justice because self-defence was otherwise raised by the evidence, obliging  the trial judge to direct the jury in accordance with ss 418 and 419 and that the failure to do so has deprived her of a fairly open chance of an acquittal .
92In our view, even if the jury accepted the reasonable possibility on all of the evidence that the appellant believed it was necessary to use a knife or implement to stab the complainant in defence of her brother (about which we remain unpersuaded, given the paucity of evidence at the trial to justify the defence being left and the express basis upon which we would refuse leave under r 4 to argue the first ground of appeal) the defence would inevitably  fail in any event, there being no reasonable view of the evidence, viewed objectively that the appellant's conduct was a reasonable response to any threat to which her brother might have been subject in the circumstances as she perceived them.  On the best view of the evidence, the complainant had a syringe in the first fight, but that was some half an hour or so earlier.  We can conceive of no submission (and none was advanced) that the use of a knife or implement to inflict a deep penetrating wound to the chest, was a reasonable response to the possibility that the complainant might still have had a syringe in his possession, or a reasonable response to her brother being attacked by the complainant during the second fight, again a factual circumstance not borne out by the evidence and, indeed, positively contradicted by the CCTV footage .  
93Had the appellant sought a direction on self defence at trial, we are satisfied the trial judge would and should have refused it.  For that reason, leave under r 4 is refused to raise ground 1 of the appeal.  
Ground 2:  failure by the trial judge to explain the legal consequences of an accidental wounding
94The appellant argued that there had been a miscarriage of justice because of the failure on the part of trial counsel to ask for directions that the complainant suffered an accidental wounding at the scene of the accident.  The appellant submitted that an hypothesis was available that accident was a reasonable explanation for the injury and that her Honour should have so directed the jury that they would need to be satisfied, in those circumstances, that the wound was occasioned as a result of the appellant's intentional act before they could convict the appellant.  Leave to argue this point on appeal is also required as it was not raised in the court below:  Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.  
95The appellant submitted that the following matters supported a case of accidental wounding:  on the appellant's evidence she had no animus towards the complainant and by intervening in the fight she was simply trying to break it up, an account which, she contended, was consistent with the eyewitness evidence;  the fight was ""fast moving, uncontrolled and uncontrollable"";  she exhibited no violence towards the complainant by way of touching or kicking him;  on the expert evidence it was not established that the injury was necessarily caused by a knife that was deliberately utilised;  Dr Ashour was unable to comment on the force required to inflict the wound that the complainant suffered;  and the CCTV footage was equally consistent with the injury being the result of a deliberate act as it was with an unintentional act, for example, of the complainant being pushed in the altercation onto the knife or other implement that the appellant was holding.  
96The appellant also contended that, on a viewing of the CCTV footage, the Crown could not negative accidental wounding.  The appellant at times also advanced arguments that the complainant could have fallen onto a piece of glass or a broken bottle.  In this regard, the appellant relied upon the complainant's acceptance in cross-examination that he had told the woman in the brothel that he thought he had tripped over.  However, this does not fully reflect the complainant's evidence which is set out at [30], and Ms Laming denied he had said that he had fallen over. This argument was not confined to the possibility that he might have tripped over after he moved away from the altercation.  A submission was made that he could haven fallen on glass during the course of the altercation, although it should be noted that the complainant was not questioned as to whether he had been accidentally stabbed or had fallen onto a sharp object at the scene.  However, the appellant's primary position was that the possibility of the injury having occurred accidentally was demonstrated on the CCTV footage.  As we understand her final submissions, the appellant accepted that the possibility of the complainant having been wounded by falling onto glass was somewhat speculative.
97The appellant relied upon the following evidence of Dr Ashour, who she contended, could not discount the possibility of accidental penetration by some implement or object other than a knife.  In particular, she submitted that Dr Ashour's evidence did not establish that the wound was the result of a deliberate stabbing.  Dr Ashour's evidence was as follows:
""Q.  On the statement or the report that you have prepared do you agree that you've got a question mark, can you see where you've got provisional diagnosis?A.  Yes.
Q.  You've got there question mark stab wound?A.  Yes.
Q.  With right side of pneumothorax?A.  Yes.
Q.  Is there any particular significance about the question mark, or why did you put it there?A.  It is more likely possibility of stab, I didn't see a knife or something, I was - you just rely on information given.  It is more likely given the information given and the clinical - the wound inspection expiration that looked clean cut, sort of small like a short object, just reason to make you think it is more likely a stab wound.
Q.  A knife is certainly a sharp sort of implement that could have caused the wound that you observed, that's accurate to say, a sharp knife?A.  Yes knife or any other sharp object.
Q.  Would that include a piece of broken glass or would that generate some sort of jagged edge?A.  I can't really know, but it's a possibility, I'm unable to tell you exactly, it is not my area of expertise.""  
98The appellant also relied on the CCTV footage.  Counsel for the appellant contended that if the Court considered that she was depicted holding something in her hand, then it was also possible, from a viewing of frames 10 and 11, that at that point the complainant was in the arms of her brother, who, she contended, was at that point pushing the complainant forward.  The import of the submission was that in the course of those movements, the complainant fell (or might have fallen) onto or moved into the appellant's outstretched arm and came into contact with the knife in her hand.  The appellant also relied upon the evidence of Ms Becker that she was not behaving aggressively but rather seemed to be trying to place herself between the two men.  The appellant submitted that this was analogous to the fourth factor considered to be relevant by McHugh J in Stevens.  
99In Stevens, the appellant's appeal from his conviction for murder was allowed because the trial judge had refused to give a direction to the jury as to accidental death.  The deceased had been the friend and business partner of the appellant.  The appellant gave evidence that as he was trying to take a rifle away from the deceased who was about to shoot himself, the shot that killed him was discharged.  In a recorded telephone call to an ambulance service shortly after the shooting, the appellant said that he was ""going to call it an accident for the moment"":  see [21].
100McHugh J, at [24], stated that if the jury rejected the appellant's account, it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had killed the deceased.  However, that did not mean that the appellant had to be convicted of murder.  His Honour considered that there were four other pieces of independent evidence that entitled them to return a verdict of not guilty.  Those four matters would have enabled the jury to conclude that accident was a reasonable explanation of the whole of the evidence.  The fourth of those matters was the friendly relationship between the two men, the factor upon which the appellant relied in this case as being analogous to her case that she had no animus towards the appellant.  
101McHugh J after identifying those matters, observed, at [25] : 
""As I have indicated, the prosecution case was a circumstantial evidence case. Such a case requires a direction to 'the jury that, if there is any reasonable hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the [accused], it is their duty to acquit.' In determining whether a reasonable hypothesis exists, the accused is not required to establish by inference that he or she is innocent. In Barca v The Queen, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ said: 
'However, although a jury cannot be asked to engage in groundless speculation it is not incumbent on the defence either to establish that some inference other than that of guilt should reasonably be drawn from the evidence or to prove particular facts that would tend to support such an inference. If the jury think that the evidence as a whole is susceptible of a reasonable explanation other than that the accused committed evidence that entitled the jury to return a verdict of not guilty of the crime charged the accused is entitled to be acquitted.'""  (citations omitted)
102His Honour continued, at [30]:
""... Juries cannot take into account fantastic or far-fetched possibilities. But they 'themselves set the standard of what is reasonable in the circumstances.' ... In the present case, the jury might reasonably conclude that the Crown had not proved to the requisite standard that the death was not caused by accident. That conclusion may have been based on no more than a judgment that, given the relationship of the two men, the expert evidence concerning the rifle and the telephone call, they were not satisfied that it was not death by accident""  (citations omitted).
103Callinan J, at [158], noted that ""accident"" (as used in the Criminal Code (Qld)) bore its ""natural, sometimes graphic connotations of an unhappy, unintended, and unexpected adverse event"".
104The Crown submitted that this case was distinguishable from Stevens in three respects.  First, it was factually dissimilar from Stevens.  In Stevens, a question had arisen on the evidence as to whether the gun had accidentally discharged.  Secondly, in order for a jury direction to be required in respect of accidental wounding, some other event has to be identified as the cause, or a possible cause, of the wounding.  In this case, no clear alternative event was identified.  Thirdly, in this case, r 4 applied, whereas in Stevens, a request for a direction had been made.  
105The Crown also submitted that the trial judge had appropriately dealt with any alternative possibility, in that she had clearly directed the jury that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had a knife and that she stabbed the complainant in the chest with it.  The direction to which the Crown referred was as follows: 
""The Crown, with respect to count one, must first of all prove that [the appellant] wounded [the complainant] ... 
You then would consider whether there was an intention on the part of [the appellant] to cause grievous bodily harm ...
... Intent and intention are familiar words.  They carry their ordinary meaning in the law.  How do you prove someone's intention unless they tell you what it is?  Well here the Crown seeks to prove the intention of [the appellant], being inferred or deduced from the circumstances in which the injury or the wounding occurred ... The Crown, quite rightly, is entitled to rely on the actions of [the appellant], if you find those to be the actions of [the appellant], in the circumstances, to suggest that you could only infer that the person intended to cause very serious injury ... 
... Perhaps I could illustrate it in another way.  If one person clobbers another person on the head with a hammer, you might think that the obvious and inevitable outcome is that the person being clobbered is going to receive a very serious bodily injury.  If the hitting of the other person on the head with the hammer was deliberate, as opposed to an accidental act, then the ready conclusion is the person intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury on the other person.  You might think that there is no real difficulty at all, about coming to that conclusion.""  (emphasis added)
106Her Honour also clearly directed the jury that the Crown had to prove that the appellant's brother did not stab the complainant.
107Her Honour correctly directed the jury in respect of a circumstantial case  that:
""If there is some other conclusion which is reasonably open, that there is another reasonable explanation which is inconsistent with guilt, it is your duty to find the accused not guilty.""  
108The Crown submitted that it was clear on this direction that the jury was told of the need for them to be satisfied that the appellant's state of mind accompanying the act was one of intent, as distinct from the injury being caused accidentally.  Although the trial judge did not refer to either of the accidental mechanisms postulated by the appellant on the appeal she was not asked to since neither were raised by trial counsel.
109In our opinion, the submission advanced on the appeal that the injury could have been sustained accidentally involves the type of speculation in which juries are not permitted to engage.  The possibility of the complainant having been pushed on to a knife or sharp implement that the appellant was holding, which would have required the jury to reject her sworn evidence that she did not have a knife or sharp implement, is, on the facts, merely speculative.  This case is not like Stevens where there was independent evidence that allowed for the possibility of accident.  The possibility of such an accident as was argued here bears no relationship to the evidence.  It is not consistent with the CCTV footage.  Rather, the CCTV footage shows the appellant lunging forward with an outstretched arm.  It is not consistent with the appellant's evidence or that of her brother.  If the wounding happened in the vicinity of 621 Hunter Street at police marker D, the only two persons who could have been holding the knife were the appellant or her brother.  Each denied having a knife.  Accidental wounding is not supported by Ms Becker's evidence who says nothing on this topic.  The only evidence which is neutrally available is that of Dr Ashour.  That is not evidence of accidental wounding.  Some other reasonable explanation for the wound would have to be postulated.
110The possibility of falling on glass was not an hypothesis that arose on the evidence.  Notwithstanding that a crime scene was established within a relatively proximate time to the wounding, there was no evidence of any glass having been found.  The police officers were not questioned about the presence of glass.  The appellant herself recognised that the wounding by broken glass was perhaps ""speculative"". 
111But in any event, the Court is of the opinion that the trial judge's directions to the jury were sufficient to instruct the jury of the requirement that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was appellant who had stabbed the complainant and that she had done so with the intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.  This, as the directions made clear, required the jury to be satisfied that the wounding was not accidental.  The hypotheses upon which the appellant relied were not advanced at trial.  It was not appropriate for her Honour to suggest alternate hypotheses as to how the wounding occurred.
112The fact that no issue of accidental wounding was raised at trial, may itself have been a matter of a considered forensic decision.  It was not suggested that trial counsel had been incompetent.  The appellant submitted, however, that regardless of whether a forensic decision had been made not to raise the point, having regard to the evidence and, in particular, what was shown on the CCTV footage, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to give a direction:  see Carney at [64].  For the above reasons we reject that submission. 
113The Court would not grant leave to raise ground 2.  This ground, like ground 1, has involved an attempt by the appellant to place postulations before the Court that were not issues in the trial, do not have a basis in the evidence and amount to no more than an attempt to run a different case on appeal.  
Ground 3:  a miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the trial judge's evidential analysis in the summing up of that there was ""nothing to suggest"" that the acts that were said to constitute the affray were lawful
114The appellant was charged, by count 3 on the indictment, of using unlawful violence towards the complainant such that a person of reasonable firmness if present at the scene would have feared for their safety (the affray offence).  
115The trial judge gave the following directions in respect of that count:
""As to the third count, the count of affray, the Crown must prove the following elements beyond reasonable doubt.  Again that it occurred on the date and place.  That [the appellant] used or threatened unlawful violence towards [the complainant].  Violence, in law, means violent conduct towards a person and is not restricted to conduct causing or intending to cause injury or damage but includes any other conduct such as throwing punches or kicking out towards a person, as examples, even if those punches and kicks fall short of actually making contact.  [The appellant] must be shown to intend to use or threaten violence and be aware that her conduct may be violent or appear to threaten violence. The prosecution must also prove that those violent acts were unlawful.  Again there is nothing to suggest that those acts, if that is what you find them to be, were lawful.""  (emphasis added)  
116Her Honour then referred to the CCTV footage and continued
""On the other hand, the defence in relation to this charge, is that [the appellant] was not at all actually involved in using or threatening violence towards [the complainant].  She was there in order to actually break up what was happening to [the complainant] at the hands of her brother, Jason Wilson.""   
117The following day, her Honour gave further directions to the jury in respect of the affray:
""The Crown must prove that [the appellant] used or threatened unlawful violence towards the complainant.  Violence means violent conduct towards a person, is not restricted to conduct causing or intending to cause injury or damage but includes anything like throwing punches, kicks that do not land, that type of thing, that can amount to violent conduct for the purpose of proving, the Crown proving this element.  It must also be unlawful.  And here I do not think that there is any suggestion that if that is what was happening then it was unlawful behaviour.  People cannot - it is against the law to run around kicking and punching other people, to put it most simply.""  
118The appellant contended that the portion of this direction emphasised in bold (set out at [115]), was factually incorrect.  She argued that there was evidence that she had gone to the defence of her brother and in the coincident pursuit of the lawful arrest of the person who had earlier assaulted her brother. 
119There are two responses to the contention that the direction was factually incorrect.  First, her Honour did not say that there was nothing to suggest that the appellant's actions were lawful.  Her Honour was directing the jury that if they considered that the appellant was depicted in the video kicking and throwing punches, even if they ""did not land"", then such actions were not lawful.  Her Honour also clearly put the defence case that the appellant was not involved in using violence towards the complainant. 
120However, the appellant contended that her Honour, in respect of this count, should have directed the jury in respect of self defence and on a citizen's right to arrest.  This submission goes to the second response.
121An issue had been raised during the course of the trial as to self defence relating to this count.  Trial counsel made an application for a direction in relation to self defence.  The Crown submitted that there was no evidentiary basis for that direction.  The Crown also submitted that, in any event, if the jury accepted the appellant's evidence that she was trying to break up the fight, she was not guilty of the offence of affray and for that reason, there was no issue of self-defence.  The Crown Prosecutor said that it was the Crown case that the appellant was not trying to break up the altercation between her brother and the complainant.  Rather, she joined in the attack.  As the Crown Prosecutor pointed out, the appellant ""went around her brother, approached [the complainant], came in contact with [the complainant], joining in the attack"".
122Her Honour summed up on the charge of affray.  Trial counsel then withdrew her request for a direction in respect of self defence relating to the affray.  On the appeal, the appellant contended that counsel was mistaken to have done so in that she had relied upon an incorrect statement of the law by the Crown referred to above.
123The Court is of the opinion that the case of self defence in respect of the charge of affray did not arise on the evidence.  Further, as the Crown submitted on the appeal, confirming the position of the Crown at trial, a direction of self-defence was not only not required, but such a direction could have been confusing to the jury.  If the jury accepted that she had gone into break up the fight and did not herself use violence, she would not have been guilty of the charge. 
124Trial counsel had taken a considered position in relation to seeking the direction.  She first indicated that whilst the direction was sought, she was not sure that it ""gets across the line"", meaning, as the Court understands it, that counsel was unsure as to whether self-defence was available, such as to require a direction.  Then, after having heard the directions given by her Honour in relation to the affray, trial counsel expressly withdrew the request for the direction.  There is and could be no complaint about her Honour's direction.
125As already indicated, there has been no suggestion of incompetence on the part of counsel.  In those circumstances, the decision to withdraw the request of a direction should be viewed as one where counsel recognised that the position of the appellant may have been jeopardised if a direction was given.  Rather, the defence was better left as one of the appellant not having engaged in violent conduct such as to be not guilty of the affray.  
126Insofar as the appellant contended on the appeal that the jury was entitled to a direction as to a civilian's right of arrest, pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, s 100(1)(b), the Crown submitted, correctly in the Court's opinion, that there was no evidence that the appellant was intending to arrest the complainant.  Indeed, the appellant's proposition is entirely inconsistent with her own evidence summarised at [62] and [66].
127Leave is refused to raise ground 3 of the appeal.
Ground 4:  the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory  
128The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(1) provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal:
""... shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence ...""
129The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 6(1), is, as stated in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ:
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty""  (citation omitted).
130In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated, at [58], that the reference to ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" in M was the equivalent of the statutory test in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act of ""unreasonable"" or such as ""cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"".  
131Their Honours noted that for the purposes of s 6(1), the starting point was that the jury had the primary function in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.  It was integral to that proposition that the jury had seen and heard the witnesses.  However, as had been stated in M by the majority, at 494:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""
132Earlier in M, at 492, their Honours had said:
""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand"" (citations omitted).
133In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ reiterated, at [14], that:
""In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make 'an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality'"" (citations omitted).
134Their Honours then referred to the passage in M set out above.  
135The appellant submitted that it was indispensable, in the circumstances of this case, for the Court to be satisfied that the CCTV images relied upon by the Crown established the infliction of the wounding.  She contended that the poor quality of the footage was such that the jury was required to draw a conclusion, by inference, that the appellant had wounded the complainant in the absence of any expert evidence that a knife was used to inflict the wound.
136The Crown contended that this submission misstated or misunderstood the Crown case.  The Crown case, which was left to the jury by the trial judge, relied on either direct and circumstantial evidence, or alternatively, was one that depended entirely upon circumstantial evidence.  This had been a matter of discussion between the trial judge and the Crown Prosecutor after the appellant's counsel had sought a circumstantial evidence direction.  This discussion revolved around what could be seen on the CCTV footage.  
137In the end result, her Honour left the matter to the jury on the alternate bases that the CCTV footage was either direct evidence that the appellant was the person who stabbed the complainant or, if the jury was not satisfied of that from the footage, the Crown case was a circumstantial one.  There is no complaint on the appeal that her Honour erred in leaving the matter to the jury on the alternate bases. 
138There were certain aspects of the CCTV footage that were not in dispute, namely, that the appellant and her brother were shown in the footage and that the other man, who is seen with his jumper being pulled off, was the complainant.  However, the video images were of poor quality and the jury were given directions in relation to that.  
139The trial judge gave directions concerning circumstantial evidence and summarised that evidence.  This included no blood being present between the zero point and marker D, the presence of a large amount of blood at marker D, a blood trail leading to where the complainant collapsed at 9 Steel Street, the CCTV footage, the absence of damage or blood on the shirt, Jason Wilson's denial that he had stabbed the complainant and medical evidence of the wound.   
140There is no complaint on the appeal as to these directions.  The issue under consideration in this ground of appeal, as we have stated previously, is whether the verdict is unreasonable.  As indicated, in her oral submissions on the appeal, the appellant's focus in respect of this ground was upon what could be seen in the CCTV footage.  There are also ""stills"" of the relevant portions of the footage, although of poorer quality than the CCTV footage itself.  The Court reviewed this footage on several occasions during the course of oral submissions.  The Court has reviewed the CCTV footage again for the purpose of preparing these reasons.  
141The following observations made by her Honour, Fullerton J, in the course of viewing the still images, provide a convenient summary of what may be seen on the CCTV footage:
""... the appellant enters from the dark shaded shadow area to the left of the photograph with her right shoulder and her left arm behind her.  The next photograph has her entering the fully lit footpath, this time her right arm is forward and her left shoulder dropped.  Is it said by the Crown that the weapon is what is held in her right hand in that photograph, and that the next photograph namely photograph 9 if that's its numbering, shows the thrusting of the weapon into the chest of the victim?  Am I right in thinking that photograph 8, again if that be the number, is the clearest still upon which the Crown relies to show that there was a weapon in the appellant's hand?""  
142The appellant's counsel responded: 
""Yes, I think 9 is the photograph upon which the Crown rely to support that proposition.""  
143Photograph 9 depicted a ""darker horizontal type shape between the appellant and [the complainant]"", a description provided by the appellant's counsel.  It was that depiction which the Crown contended was the weapon.  However, the appellant drew attention to what she contended was shown in the footage, of:
""... conspicuous parallel lines that dot along this footpath, shadowed parallel lines that appear to be perfectly parallel again with that piece of shading which [was] said on the Crown case to be a knife ...""  
144As the Court understands the submission, the parallel lines were the depiction of joints or cracks on the footpath, but could mistakenly be taken as a shadow of an object being held by the appellant.  There are shortcomings in this submission.  The most fundamental is that a careful viewing of the footage at still 9 shows the appellant holding an object in her right hand.  This is quite independent of there being any shadowing of an implement on the footpath.  But in any event, it was not obvious to the Court on viewing the footage in court and subsequently that there were parallel lines on the footpath, as the appellant contended.  
145The appellant next submitted that the most that the evidence established as to the wound was that it was a penetrative injury.  She submitted that Dr Ashour was not in a position to give any evidence as to what caused the injury, that is, whether it was due to a stabbing injury or was inflicted by some other mechanism.  The possibilities advanced by the appellant included that the complainant stabbed himself, or fell on some glass or other sharp object, or, as was advanced in respect of ground 2, that he fell, or was pushed onto the knife.  However, it was not suggested to the complainant in cross-examination that he had stabbed himself or fallen onto glass or was pushed causing him to fall onto the knife.  Likewise, no questions were asked of the appellant's brother and the appellant's evidence did not suggest this possibility.  
146The Crown submitted that the evidence established that the wounding could only have occurred in the course of the altercation near 621 Hunter Street in the vicinity of police marker D and that there were only two possibilities as to who stabbed the complainant:  the appellant or her brother.  The Crown submitted that the only person who was doing any ""stabbing motions"" as portrayed in the CCTV footage was the appellant.
147The appellant's brother said in his evidence in chief that he did not stab the complainant.  This evidence was not challenged by the appellant in cross-examination.  Notwithstanding the absence of challenge to her brother's evidence, the appellant submitted to this Court that even if the Court considered that there was some consistency between what was shown on the footage as potentially giving rise to the injury, there was the same consistency in the appellant's brother's conduct as potentially having caused the injury.  The appellant submitted that there was no rational basis upon which the Court could favour the conclusion that it was her who had inflicted the injury rather than her brother, or that the complainant had otherwise injured himself by falling on a sharp object.  
148The principles that govern this Court's task in determining whether a guilty verdict is unreasonable are set out above.  In the Court's opinion, on viewing the CCTV footage, the appellant is depicted in frame 9 as holding an implement in her right hand.  In the next frame she is seen lunging in front of her brother at the point where the complainant was being pulled by her brother. 
149The complainant's evidence has been set out in summary above.  However, the following evidence is of particular importance in relation to what happened during the course of the altercation.  He said that having run a few hundred metres up the road he ""ran out of puff"".  He turned around and heard a woman's voice ""screaming, swearing, yelling"".  He was still on his feet.  He then described what happened: 
""Q.  And what do you remember of that, this being beaten up?A.  I just remember hits coming from left, right and centre.  There was too many to deal with.
Q.  What happened then?A.  I remember I knew I was in trouble.
Q.  No do not tell us what you knew, just tell us what happened okay?A.  I just remember getting hit all over the place.
Q.  Did you stay on your feet?A.  I think I might have, I don't know.  I might have dropped on the ground.
Q.  So you do not know, is that right?A.  I can remember being winded and I thought, I'm seriously hurt.  I can remember the wind getting taken out of me.
Q.  What do you mean by that?A.  I just remember getting winded, like no energy.
Q.  Can you describe being winded with no energy any better than that?A.  It was all over for, like I couldn't defend myself any more.
Q.  What happened next?A.  I took off running.""  
150The evidence of being ""winded"", as if having ""no energy"", is consistent with the complainant being stabbed and, as a result, suffering a pneumothorax.  
151The CCTV footage also shows the complainant's jumper being pulled off him by the appellant's brother in the course of the altercation.  The evidence of the trail of blood commencing from the place of the altercation, the finding of his shirt and jumper at that point and the absence of blood on, or any rips in, his shirt and jumper is only consistent with his having been stabbed during the course of the second fight in the vicinity of police marker D.  The forensic evidence proved that the blood trailing from the site of the second fight at police marker D to the brothel in Steel Street was that of the complainant.  
152The Court is not satisfied, for the reasons given, that there was a reasonably possible case of accidental wounding or a case of the appellant defending her brother.  There is no doubt on the evidence that the only two people who could have inflicted the injury was the appellant or her brother.  The Court does not accept that on the video footage it was equally possible that the appellant's brother inflicted the wound.  The video footage shows the appellant with an implement in her hand and lunging forward in a swift and energetic thrusting motion.  Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, the Court is satisfied ""upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"" that the appellant deliberately inflicted the wound sustained by the complainant:  see M at 493.  
153Ground 4 of the appeal is rejected.  The question of whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence as one of fact:  see M at 492-493.  Leave is therefore required:  Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(b).  We would grant leave but reject the ground.  
Conclusion 
154The appeal must be dismissed.  Before pronouncing final orders, it is necessary to return to a matter mentioned at the outset.  The sentences imposed upon the appellant are set out at [2] above.  The fixed term imposed for the offence of affray expired on 21 February 2013.  The non-parole period for the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was due to expire on 21 April 2013.  However, appeals-bail was granted on 25 February 2013.  The appellant was, at that time, still to serve 1 month and 27 days of the non-parole period fixed by the sentencing judge with 21 months and 27 days of the total term of imprisonment to run.
155Under the Criminal Appeal Act, s 18(2) the time during which an appellant is at liberty on bail pending the determination of her or his appeal does not count as part of any term of imprisonment imposed upon her or him.  Section 28A of the Criminal Appeal Act empowers the Court to ""make any order that it thinks fit to give effect to section 18"".  Accordingly, it is appropriate for this Court to make orders for the re-commencement of the non-parole period and additional term passed on the appellant by the sentencing judge.
156The total sentence imposed was one of 2 years and 6 months, that is, less than 3 years.  In such a case, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 50 requires a court to ""make an order directing the release of the offender on parole at the end of the non-parole period"", usually referred to as a parole order.  It has come to the Court's attention that the learned sentencing judge did not pronounce a parole order, probably because the requirements of s 50 were not drawn to her Honour's attention by counsel during the proceedings on sentence.  In our view, in making orders in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act, s 28A, it is appropriate for us to remedy this oversight, and our orders will include a parole order directing the appellant's release, at the expiration of the non-parole period, to supervision as prescribed by the regulations under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 for the duration of her parole period.
157The Court's orders are:
(1) Leave granted to advance ground 4;  
(2) Appeal dismissed;
(3) Under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 28A, the sentence imposed on the appellant in the District Court of New South Wales on 28 June 2012 for the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is to re-commence today, Friday 20 December 2013.  The non-parole period will expire after 1 month and 27 days on 15 February 2014.  The additional term expires on 14 October 2015;
(4) The appellant is to be released on parole on 16 February 2014 subject to the supervision prescribed by the regulations under the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 during the balance of her term of imprisonment.

2763078,AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 333,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2HALL J: I agree with Schmidt J. 

3SCHMIDT J: On 22 February 2012 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge under s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) of importing a marketable quantity of a border-controlled drug, cocaine. The maximum penalty for the offence was 25 years imprisonment. On 22 March 2012, Blackmore DCJ sentenced the applicant to serve 5 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months, after a 25% discount of 50% for her early plea and assistance to authorities. The sentence dated from her arrest at Sydney airport on 18 December 2011.

4A notice of intention to appeal was lodged on 24 October 2012. The appeal was lodged on 9 August 2013. The applicant sought an extension of time to lodge her appeal, which was not opposed by the Crown. That application is granted.

5The applicant relies on only one ground of appeal, namely that his Honour erred in his assessment of the discount she should receive on sentence for the assistance she gave to authorities after her arrest.

Blackmore DCJ's sentencing judgment

6The applicant travelled to Australia from Malaysia on the day of her arrest. She came under the suspicion of customs authorities at the airport and admitted on questioning that she had swallowed 66 pellets of a drug on later analysis found to be 400 grams of pure cocaine. She was then pregnant.

7The applicant agreed to provide assistance to authorities. After treatment in hospital she participated in a controlled operation which resulted in the arrest of those who were to receive the drugs from her.

8The sentencing hearing came on with some urgency, as it resulted, due to the impending birth of the applicant's child.

9A statement of facts was then agreed, various documents, including statements made by the applicant to customs officers and police were tendered, as well as an undertaking given under s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

10A psychologist's report prepared by Ms Rima Basr was tendered and the applicant also gave evidence, adopting the history she had given Ms Basr. The applicant gave an account, amongst other matters, of how she had been recruited in Malaysia to carry cocaine into Australia and the arrangements made for delivery of the drug here to members of the drug syndicate for whom she had carried the drug.

11It was common ground that on arrest the applicant not only made complete admissions, but also then co-operated with police, providing assistance, which shortly afterwards resulted in the arrest of the offenders to whom she was to deliver the drugs in a controlled police operation. She also undertook to give evidence at their trial and, it is common ground, in fact later did so. She also provided other intelligence which was provided to Malaysian authorities. It was common ground between the parties at the sentencing hearing that the assistance she had provided had thus been 'very high'. 

12In his sentencing judgment, Blackmore DCJ noted the circumstances of the applicant's arrest and that the street value of the cocaine which she carried was some $AU285,714 to $AU320,000. As to the seriousness of her offence, his Honour did not accept that she had given herself up to the authorities, observing that the applicant had rather come to their attention in circumstances he described. His Honour considered that she had been lucky that the containers she had swallowed did not rupture. She was then not feeling well and was taken to hospital and later recovered so that she was able to provide the assistance which she gave. 

13His Honour considered that the sentence imposed on the applicant had to reflect considerations of general deterrence, given the risk she had posed to her unborn child, albeit noting that the Crown did not rely on that as an aggravating matter. He found her to be a courier, but did not accept that her offence was the result of duress, or that she did not know what she was carrying. His Honour also found the applicant to be a person of prior good character, having no prior criminal record, who thus made a good courier for the syndicate she had assisted. He accepted that she had been naïve, but in the circumstances considered that her prior good character could not carry much weight on sentencing. His Honour noted her personal circumstances and concluded that her offending was partly the result of greed.

14His Honour also considered her family background, her other young child and the circumstances pertaining to the child who was about to be born, as well as the applicant's potential access to a program which permitted mothers to keep young children with them while in custody. He also noted the difficulties which she faced, given that both she and the child were foreign nationals. 

15His Honour considered the psychologist's report, which also addressed the consequences for the child's removal from her mother. His Honour considered that the applicant had deliberately put that child at risk of harm, by her offence. He concluded that in the circumstances, the consequences of the sentence for the child could not be considered by way of mitigation of the applicant's offence. He considered that to take that into account, as was urged for the applicant, might encourage recruitment of pregnant women to act as drug couriers and for the commission of further such offences. 

16His Honour concluded, however, that the applicant was entitled to a very significant discount on sentence for her assistance, which he found to be:

'... of a very high order and has placed her at some risk whilst ever she remains here and also when she returns to Malaysia. The assistance has already achieved concrete results and her help in that regard was regarded essential.""


17In the result for that assistance and the early plea his Honour gave the applicant a discount of 50% on her sentence, only 5% of which he attributed to future assistance.

The parties' cases

18The applicant's case was that the discount which his Honour granted her did not adequately reflect the very tangible and real assistance which she had given authorities, which had not only led to the arrest and conviction of offenders in Australia after she gave evidence, but the provision of previously unknown information to Malaysian authorities.

19Given her very early plea, and the nature of her assistance, it was argued that this was a case where the combined discount should have exceeded 50%, reflecting that the result of her assistance was that she was at risk in both Australia and Malaysia, 

20It is settled that a combined discount for an early plea and assistance could exceed 50%, but rarely more than 60% (see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 at [11] discussed in R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415 at [68] - [71]). It was accepted that fixing a discount was a discretionary matter, which had to be exercised in accordance with binding principles and that on appeal error had to be established in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. It was the applicant's case that such error was here apparent.

21That was submitted to be revealed by the evidence as to the nature of the assistance which the applicant had rendered, which established that this was one of those exceptional cases where a discount greater than 50% was warranted.

22The Crown's case was that his Honour had correctly identified the applicant's assistance to have been of a very high order, as both parties had submitted to him at the sentencing hearing. That there had been no error in not finding that the assistance rendered had been 'exceptional'. 

The cases advanced below

23In resolving this issue it is pertinent to consider the respective cases advanced at the sentencing hearing. Confidential evidence was led as to the nature of the assistance provided. I have examined that confidential material. It establishes a proper basis for the cases both parties advanced below, that the assistance which the applicant rendered had been of a very high order. Neither party then submitted that it had been exceptional.

24In written submissions below the Crown submitted that combined discounts of more than 40% were exceptional and would not be granted in cases where there was no evidence that the offender would spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. It was accepted that the applicant had given significant assistance, which was identified, with the result that she was in protective custody, which, it was accepted, should be reflected in the discount given.

25In written submissions advanced for the applicant it was submitted that the applicant's assistance warranted a 'high discount', the most helpful part of her assistance having occurred early, almost immediately after her detection.

26This matter was taken up with the parties in oral submissions. His Honour suggested to the applicant's counsel that the assistance given by the applicant had been 'very high and therefore its probably getting to the top of the range'. That was accepted, but his Honour continued:

""It may not, just so that I don't mislead you, but it may not be right at the top of the range but its certainly over and above the usual because she's offered significant - she gave significant assistance. She put herself out to do it, she put herself in danger by doing it and she's offered future assistance.""


27The ratio between the parole and non-parole periods which would be imposed was also addressed, his Honour observing that if the sentence was to be reduced as the result of a significant discount, the non-parole period could not also be reduced significantly. His Honour then observed that ""50% might be a reasonable result', observing:

""The way you do it is you start with a normal sentence, whatever the normal sentence might be. You reduce it by the discount for the plea. You reduce it by the discount for whatever assistance is provided and then you look at the break up of the parole and non-parole period. Because if the factors here, the child and the child in Malaysia and the fact she's got no contacts here you may well reduce the parole period. That's the way I would look at it. But that's what I'm just saying, you can disagree with me. The Crown might disagree with me.""


28The response given for the applicant was 'I don't want to be heard further'. 

29For the Crown it was then submitted that more than a 50% combined discount was available only in exceptional cases, and while the assistance which had been given was at a high level, it was not exceptional. His Honour suggested that the range might be 45-50%. He was reminded of the need to identify a component for future assistance. His Honour observed that it seemed that the assistance already provided had been vital. That was not accepted by the Crown, given the nature of the actual assistance in fact provided and the overseas assistance having been simply the provision of intelligence. After discussion it was accepted that weighing would be given to past, rather than future assistance, given its value.

30In reply such a weighing was accepted for the applicant, it being submitted that the assistance she had provided earlier had been 'vital'. His Honour plainly accepted the consensus which had emerged on the evidence, assigning only 5% of the 50% discount for future assistance.

The appeal has not been made out

31Under s 16A(2)(h) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the degree to which an offender has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or other offences in the past, is a matter to be taken into account on sentencing (see R v Vo [2006] NSWCCA 165 at [36]). Relevant considerations in assessing the extent of a discount for such assistance includes the effectiveness of the assistance given and its value to the authorities (see R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 and R v Barrientos [1999] NSWCCA 1).

32In R v Barrientos, Abadee J reviewed the authorities on such assistance in Commonwealth offences observing at [47]: 

""Thus in the determination of any discount the relevance and importance of the benefits flowing from assistance is important: see also R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. There is no fixed tariff for assistance given. Where there is significant assistance the amount 'customarily given in New South Wales which with few exceptions, appears to range from 20 per cent to 50 per cent': see R v Chu per Spigelman CJ at 6-7. That said, the law does not mandate the identification of a precise discrete quantifiable discount for assistance or that the assistance falls within the range. The matter of that discount or its quantification will depend upon a number of factors and the facts of the particular case under consideration. I do not see the authorities suggesting that once any assistance is found then the allowance for such must reflect a range. The worth of the assistance may take it below the range. Whether it does is a matter of fact to be evaluated in accordance with the proved circumstances of the case."" 


33Under s 21E(1) a sentence may also be reduced because the offender has undertaken to co-operate in future with law enforcement agencies. In that event the Court must state that the sentence is being reduced for that reason, as well as specifying the sentence that would have applied otherwise (see R v Tae [2005] NSWCCA 29 at [19]). 

34This is designed to assist an appellate court in re-sentencing an offender who fails to comply with such an undertaking. Section 21E(2) permits an appeal against sentence if the offender fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with such an undertaking. If such an offender fails to co-operate, having received a reduced sentence on the basis of promised co-operation, on appeal the Court must substitute the sentence or non-parole period that would have been imposed, but for the promised co-operation (see s 21E(3)(a)).

35In the case of a guilty plea for a Commonwealth offence, a court is not required to specify a quantifiable discount (see Lee v R [2012] NSWCCA 123 at [58].) In arriving at any discount care must always be taken to ensure that the resulting sentence is not manifestly inadequate. In R v A [2004] NSWCCA 292 it was thus explained at [25] - [27]:

""25 The availability of a discount for assistance, depending on its worth, in order to foster the interests of law enforcement and to recognise the contrition involved as well as the potential risks to the offender, is well recognised: R v Salameh (1991) 55 A Crim R 384, R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, R v Cartright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and R v Dinic NSWCCA 3 September 1997. It is important, if the purpose for allowing a discount is to be achieved, that the offender standing for sentence be clearly appraised of the fact that a benefit was conferred. That will not be conveyed by a bare statement of the kind that was made in this case that the assistance was judged to have been ""substantial and beneficial"". 

26 The level of the discount has customarily been accepted as falling within the range of 20 to 50% R v Chu NSWCCA 16 October 1998, R v Pang [1999] 105 A Crim R 474 and R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 at para 71. An allowance at the upper end has been reserved for cases where there has been particularly significant assistance, usually involving the offender accepting an obligation to give evidence against other offenders. 

27 Where the factors of a plea and assistance are each available, it does not follow that any resulting discount is to be compounded or accumulated: R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 and R v Hameed [2001] NSWCCA 287. Otherwise there is a risk of the sentence becoming one which is not of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the case. In such cases a combined discount will normally be appropriate: Thompson and Houlton at para 129; El-Hani at paras 65 to 70, and R v Zaluaga-Gomez [2002] NSWCCA 358.""


36As to combined discounts in excess of 50%, in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151, Howie J, with whose additional remarks McClellan CJ at CL agreed, said at [5] that: 

""...discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40 percent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population.""

37Latham J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed, observed at [54]:
""While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender.""

38In this case, the submissions advanced for the first time on appeal that the applicant should have received a combined discount greater than 50%, have no foundation in the evidence, or in the way in which the case was conducted below. The evidence established that the applicant is likely to spend a substantial part of her sentence in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. That, and the assistance which she rendered, made it appropriate that the combined discount for her early plea and assistance exceeded 40%.

39It is not apparent from the evidence that the applicant's assistance could properly be characterised as having been more than assistance 'of a very high order', as the parties submitted below and his Honour accepted. That was properly reflected in the sentence imposed, which was reduced by a combined discount of 50%

40The argument pressed on appeal, that the component for future assistance which his Honour identified should have been more than 5%, must be rejected. Even if it were accepted, that could not properly result in a total discount of more then 50% in the circumstances of this case. 

41To make good the submission that the applicant's assistance ought to have been found to have been either 'extraordinary' or 'exceptional' so as to warrant a combined discount 'well above' 50%, comparisons were drawn with various cases. Those comparisons were not made out. 

42In R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; (2012) 221 A Crim R 63, for example, the assistance given was described to have been (at [135]):

""Turning to the situation of the Respondent, it is unnecessary to particularise the assistance beyond saying that it was extremely valuable, fell into the exceptional category and led to convictions of a number of offenders, one for very substantial drug dealing and some for murder.""

43There was not assistance of that kind given in this case. In Regina v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38, the Crown conceded that the discount given was properly available and did not press its appeal against the conclusion that the circumstances were truly exceptional, warranting a 60% discount, which was accepted by the Court after reviewing of the confidential exhibit (see at [22]). A review of the confidential material in this case does not provide a basis for such a conclusion.

44Other cases referred to, which were decided before Sukkar and SZ are likewise not of assistance to the applicant. They establish that combined discounts of more than 60% have been given in the past, but not that such a discount is warranted in this case. In R v NP [2003] NSWCCA 195, for example, the circumstances of the assistance rendered warranting a combined discount of 60% are not revealed sufficiently for any reliable comparison to be made. In R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 the assistance was accepted to have been vital and resulted on appeal in a combined discount of 52.8%. Here the discount given was 50%. What warranted an additional 2.8% discount in that case, is not apparent and thus not of assistance to the applicant. In R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151 a discount of 60% resulted from assistance which had led to two separate strike forces assembled by police in response to information provided by the applicant, which led to a number of police ""targets"" being arrested and charged. This is not such a case. 

45The comparisons sought to be drawn on appeal do not establish that his Honour's discretion miscarried. The explanation for the applicant's assistance not having been described below as either 'extraordinary' or 'exceptional' is that the evidence did not warrant such descriptions or a combined discount greater than 50% which was submitted below to appropriately reflect the assistance she had provided.

46In the result, in my view, the appeal must be dismissed.

Orders

47I would make the following orders;

1. Leave to file the appeal out of time is allowed.

2. The appeal be dismissed.

		03 February 2014",2013-12-22 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763093,R v Orchard [2013] NSWCCA 342,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 27 September 2010 the appellant appeared for trial in the District Court. He was arraigned on an indictment charging him with one offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMTA) of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, namely an amount which was particularised as not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, namely, 1 kilogram. He pleaded not guilty. The commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was 250 grams. 

2As noted, the particulars to the indictment identified the amount alleged to have been supplied as exceeding a ""large commercial quantity"" of methylamphetamine, namely 1 kilogram. The significance of that particular is that, if established, it rendered the appellant liable to punishment for a maximum term of life imprisonment (s 33(3)). If it were not established, conviction for the offence under s 25(2) rendered him liable to imprisonment for a maximum term of twenty years or a fine of $3,500 or both.

3The appellant's trial proceeded before a judge sitting without a jury in accordance with s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The trial occupied 99 hearing days. On 13 May 2011 the trial judge returned a verdict of guilty. His Honour's reasons were handed down on 20 May 2011 (the 'conviction judgment'). His Honour found the appellant guilty of the charge on the indictment, but was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the amount of methylamphetamine supplied exceeded a large commercial quantity.

4On 12 August 2011 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years and six months, with a minimum term of ten years and five months. His sentence was fixed to commence from 8 May 2008.

5The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. To the extent necessary, the Court has treated the appeal against sentence as both an application for leave to appeal and, if leave were granted, the appeal. The grounds of appeal are:

(1)The trial judge erred in finding that there was independent evidence supporting or confirming the evidence of ""AA"", a witness reasonably supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events. 

(2)The trial judge erred in not instructing himself that, in the circumstances, corroboration of the evidence of ""AA"" was required before it could be acted upon. 

(3)The trial judge erred in not giving himself a Markuleski direction (Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290) to the effect that if he had a reasonable doubt about the evidence of AA in relation to one particular transaction, he might believe it difficult to see how he could accept the evidence of AA in relation to the other transactions. 

(4)The verdict of the trial judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. 

(5)The judgment of the trial judge failed to expose the reasoning adequately, or at all, for the finding of guilt. 

(5A) The conduct and interventions by the trial judge rendered the trial unfair. 

(6)In sentencing the appellant, the judge erred in his approach to the standard non parole applicable to the offence by applying the law in accordance with R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168.

(7)In sentencing the appellant, the judge failed to take into account, or give sufficient weight to, the appellant's mental health issues and other health issues. 

(8)The sentence imposed was too severe. 

6For the reasons that follow the appeal against his conviction and sentence is dismissed. Before addressing the individual grounds of appeal it is necessary to summarise the Crown case and his Honour's findings. It is also necessary to summarise the appellant's case and the manner in which it was conducted, as well as aspects of the surveillance evidence that was tendered at the trial. Unless otherwise indicated, paragraph references are to the conviction judgment. 

The Crown Case and his Honour's Judgment

7From early 2008 until 9 May 2008 the police conducted an extensive surveillance operation into the activities of the appellant on suspicion that he was a significant dealer in methylamphetamine at the retail level in the Newcastle area. This surveillance operation extended to the activities of a number of other persons, including AA, whom the police believed sourced methylamphetamine for the appellant at the appellant's direction and behest for the purpose of a supply. One of the persons from whom AA was believed to have sourced the amphetamine was a Mr Mark Paxton who was based in Balmain, Sydney. 

8The investigation reached its denouement on 9 May 2008 when both the appellant and AA were arrested and various homes were searched. AA was arrested standing alongside a motor vehicle. The occupant of the vehicle was Benjamin Watt (""Watt"") ([254]). At the time of his arrest AA was found in possession of, inter alia, $1,105 in cash and a small resealable bag containing methylamphetamine ([255]). The vehicle was searched and revealed a plastic bag containing 27.9 grams of methylamphetamine which was 57.5% pure (at [255]). All of these items were consistent with the conclusion that AA had just supplied Watt with 27.9 grams of methylamphetamine. 

9AA lived with his partner, BB, at an address in Haig Street, Belmont, for most of the relevant period of the surveillance operation ([14]). A police search of those premises yielded a ""red Vodafone bag"" containing methylamphetamine weighing 413 grams. This was found to be of 58% purity and had been ""marginally cut"" with epsom salts ([259]). The police also found 10.3 grams of a ""brown pasty"" substance containing 10% methylamphetamine in a large plastic sandwich bag. They also discovered 118.4 grams of an ""off white"" crystalline substance which was later analysed to be amphetamine of 18.4% purity in plastic bags which were in turn wrapped in a tea-towel. The tea-towel was found in a safe ([259]). Three other plastic bags containing a total of 140.6 grams of methylamphetamine were found in the safe. Two of the bags contained two ounces each (i.e. approximately 56.7 grams) and one bag contained one ounce (i.e. approximately 24 grams) ([259]).

10The appellant was arrested at a house in Tudor Street, Belmont ([52])]. He was found in possession of various items which were consistent with what he ultimately claimed at trial was his occupation, namely a small scale drug dealer ([256]). A search of the appellant's home in Vista Parade, Belmont yielded similar results ([269]). 

11However, the results of a search of the premises at Tudor Street were more significant. Those premises were occupied by his deceased wife's parents, their daughter and her husband. In a spare room at the house $48,829 in cash was found in a bed. The appellant's children had often used that room when visiting their grandparents ([271]). Also found were records from a term deposit account in the name of the appellant's son which recorded a recent withdrawal of $11,000 ([271]). During the search the appellant's children stated that they had no knowledge of the cash found in the room they used. The appellant's mother-in-law told the police that the appellant had both access to that room and keys to the house. In his evidence at the trial, the appellant claimed that the $48,829 in cash was money he had given to his mother-in-law around a decade previously ([271]). His Honour rejected that evidence ([277]). 

12The Crown case against the appellant was comprised of six transactions in which it was alleged he had financed for AA to obtain methylamphetamine in a total amount of not less than a large commercial quantity on his behalf. With the first five transactions, the appellant was alleged to have received the methylamphetamine from AA, and thus possessed it for the purposes of supply (to retail customers) within the extended definition of supply in s 3 of the DMTA. With the sixth transaction the appellant was alleged to have financed the purchase of methylamphetamine by AA, which he never physically received, as both he and AA were arrested in the interim. With this transaction, his conduct was said to have constituted ""authorising"" AA's possession for the purpose of ""AA's supply"" or ""sending, forwarding [or] delivery"" the drug to the appellant and in this way to have also satisfied the extended definition of supply in s 3 of the DMTA. 

13The six transactions relied on by the Crown, and his Honour's finding in respect of them, were as follows.

14The first transaction was alleged by the Crown to have taken place on or about 5 February 2008. The appellant was said to have arranged for AA to purchase ""ten ounces"" (approximately 283 grams) of crystal methylamphetamine. This was said to have involved AA and BB travelling to the Pelican RSL Club near Lake Macquarie and the appellant travelling separately to the same location. AA gave evidence that the appellant gave him $64,000 in his car. AA said he provided $55,000 to a supplier and retained $9,000. AA said he received the drugs, returned to the appellant's car and handed them to him ([18]). The trial judge accepted that AA went to the Pelican RSL on behalf of and at the direction of the appellant ([407]), but was not prepared to find established, beyond reasonable doubt, any further facts concerning that transaction.

15With the second transaction the Crown alleged that between 23 February 2008 and 28 February 2008 the appellant received ten ounces of methylamphetamine from AA that AA had purchased on his behalf for $70,000 in cash ([19] to [24]). The Crown alleged that AA purchased the drugs in two tranches from a dealer named Powick, one tranche of two ounces on 23 February 2008 at a cost of $15,000 ([21]), and the other tranche of eight ounces on 23 February at a cost of $55,000 ([24]). AA claimed that he handed both tranches to the appellant on the days he received the drugs except that, with the second tranche, AA said he removed seven grams for himself. He also said that the appellant also gave him seven grams as a payment (along with other drugs) ([24]). 

16His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that AA bought methylamphetamine on behalf of the appellant on both of these occasions. However, his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the amount of the drug that was purchased ([419]).

17With the third transaction, the Crown alleged that between 16 and 17 March 2008 the appellant received ten ounces of crystal methylamphetamine and sixteen ounces of amphetamine from AA which AA had purchased on his behalf. The Crown alleged that on 16 March 2008 the appellant gave AA $110,000 in cash and told him to purchase a ""pound"" of speed (i.e. sixteen ounces of amphetamine) and spend the rest on ""ice"" (crystal methamphetamine). AA said he then travelled to Sydney and paid $35,000 for the speed and $75,000 for the methylamphetamine to Paxton. The Crown alleges that AA obtained the drugs from Paxton and then provided them to the appellant the next day ([33-34, 428]). Although his Honour stated that he accepted AA's account ""generally"", his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the ""precise amount paid"" nor the ""precise amount bought"" ([428]). His Honour was also not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ""pound"" of drugs that was purchased contained methylamphetamine ([428]).

18With the fourth transaction, the Crown alleged that the appellant provided AA with $113,000 in cash on 28 March 2008 to enable him to purchase eighteen ounces of crystal methylamphetamine on his behalf ([37]), but that the purchase from the proposed supplier fell through. Instead AA said that on 6 April 2008 he purchased eighteen ounces of the drug from a family friend of BB, Gallagher (also known as ""uncle""), for which he paid $102,000 ([39]). The Crown alleged that AA gave these drugs to the appellant.

19It is important to note what the Crown alleges became of this eighteen ounces. It alleged that the appellant tested them and concluded that they were of poor quality. They were referred to in the trial as ""Uncle's bad ice"" ([39]). The Crown alleges that the appellant complained to AA and AA exchanged five ounces of ""Uncle's bad ice"" for $25,000 on 10 April 2008 ([443]) and swapped a further five ounces of ""Uncle's bad ice"" for eight ounces of what was later described as ""orangey/red/brown ice"" ([39]).

20On 10 April 2008 the appellant was charged with one count of supply methylamphetamine which related to a single instance of a retail level supply (unrelated to the charge on indictment) ([440]). At that time a tracking device was placed on his car by police. On 21 April 2008 one of his retail ""clients"", Tristan Lightfoot, was arrested for possession of methyl-amphetamine after leaving the appellant's premises ([248]). The Crown alleges that from that time the appellant was ""far more vigilant"", especially as he had been arrested only ten days earlier ([252]). This event is of significance in considering the surveillance material summarised below. 

21AA gave evidence that after Lightfoot's arrest the appellant came to his house at Haig Street, Belmont on 21 April 2008. AA said that the appellant handed him a ""rolled up tea-towel"" which contained one bag with approximately one ounce of crystal methylamphetamine, a bag with two ounces of crystal methylamphetamine; and a bag with six to eight ounces of crystal methylamphetamine. According to AA, he was also given a bag containing a small amount of brown methylamphetamine that was the methylamphetamine obtained in exchange for ""Uncle's bad ice"" and a bag containing the remaining four ounces of ""Uncle's bad ice"" ([43]).

22As stated, during the search of AA's premises on 9 May 2008 the police found one bag containing an ""'off white' crystalline substance"" which was 118.4 grams of low purity amphetamine wrapped in a tea-towel ([259]). The Crown case was that the contents of that bag were the remnants of ""Uncle's bad ice"" that the appellant had placed with AA for safe keeping on 21 April 2008 ([446]). His Honour accepted that part of the Crown case ([446] and [491]). 

23Hence with the fourth transaction his Honour accepted that AA purchased methylamphetamine for the appellant on the dates claimed and accepted that the 118.4 grams of low purity ice found at AA's premises on 9 May 2008 was the remnants of ""Uncle's bad ice"" that AA had obtained and given to the appellant on 6 April ([491]). Thus his Honour found that the supply by the appellant of at least that amount of methamphetamine was established beyond reasonable doubt.

24The fifth transaction alleged by the Crown was said to have taken place between 14 and 15 April 2008. According to the Crown, on 14 April 2008 AA and BB travelled to Paxton's premises in Balmain. AA said he ordered eighteen ounces of methylamphetamine on behalf of the appellant ([39]). On 15 April 2008, AA went to the appellant and told him the purchase had been organised ([41]). Later that day he returned and asked the appellant to give him $117,000, plus $1,000 for travel expenses. Having received the money, AA travelled to Balmain and purchased eighteen ounces of crystal methylamphetamine from Paxton. AA said he took half an ounce of the eighteen ounces and replaced it with epsom salts. He said he delivered it to the appellant, who gave him an ounce as payment ([42]). 

25The trial judge analysed the evidence concerning this transaction closely, especially the surveillance evidence and telephone intercepts which related to it ([450ff]). In particular, his Honour considered that the evidence from the tracking device on the appellant's car and the video surveillance strongly supported AA's evidence that the appellant had retrieved cash on 15 April 2008 in order to fund AA's purchase of drugs from Paxton ([451]). His Honour also considered that the surveillance evidence suggested that AA did not have the means to finance the purchase at a cost of $115,000 in his own right ([453]). Nevertheless, his Honour's ultimate finding in relation to the fifth transaction was ([453]):

""On the other hand, while all circumstances point to a substantial buy from Paxton on 15 April the precise amount is not independently proven or supported.""

26The sixth transaction was said by the Crown to involve the acquisition by AA on 9 May 2008 of eighteen ounces of methylamphetamine at the direction and behest of the appellant. As discussed below this transaction had a long genesis. For present purposes it is only necessary to note that, according to the Crown, on the evening of 8 May 2008, AA went to the appellant's home and was given $110,000 in cash to purchase half a kilogram of ""ice"" from Paxton. AA said he travelled to Balmain that night with BB and ""Chad"" Graham, but was unable to arrange the transaction ([46]). He said that he returned early the next day in the company of Graham ([47]). He said that Paxton gave him ten pounds of cannabis ([47]) and then later ""a red Vodafone bag containing a plastic freezer bag containing half a kilogram of crystal methylamphetamine"" ([48]). AA said he returned to Newcastle and took the Vodafone bag containing the crystal methylamphetamine into his bedroom at his house in Haig Street. He weighed up two two-ounce bags of methylamphetamine from the drugs he had just purchased, and two one-ounce bags. He placed an ounce of epsom salts into the freezer bag containing the balance of the half a kilogram of crystal methylamphetamine. He said that he placed the two two-ounce bags and one of the one-ounce bags in a safe in his bedroom. He said he placed the red Vodafone bag which contained the balance of the drugs purchased from Paxton, supplemented by the epsom salts, in a white bucket at the back of his house. He said he then took one of the one-ounce bags to supply to Watt ([50]). 

27On that day AA was arrested for supplying one ounce of methyl-amphetamine to Watt. As has already been stated, the items found at AA's premises included the 118.4 grams of low quality crystal methylamphetamine (i.e. ""Uncle's bad ice"") referable to the fourth transaction, and 10.3 grams of the brown pasty substance which was exchanged for some of ""Uncle's bad ice"". The remaining drugs included 413 grams of crystal methylamphetamine which included the epsom salts contained within the red Vodafone bag, as well as the two lots of two ounces and the one lot of one ounce of methylamphetamine found in the safe, all referable, on the Crown case, to the sixth transaction. As stated, a large amount of cash was found at the home of the appellant's deceased wife's parents in Tudor Street.

28His Honour accepted AA's evidence in respect of the sixth transaction. His Honour found:

""[488] Notwithstanding the many warnings I must give myself about AA, not only relating to his potential unreliability and/or lack of truthfulness arising from the circumstances in which he comes forward to give evidence, but also taking into account his relationship and other matters associated with BB and the fact that he gives evidence about particular events, relating to his personal affairs as well as this relationship with the accused for which there is good reason to doubt his truthfulness and reliability, I accept his truthfulness and reliability in respect of the key matter requiring proof by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt in respect of the last purchase of methylamphetamine. I also accept that he bought methylamphetamines for the accused on other occasions. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused gave him $110,000 on 8 May, for the purchase of the methylamphetamine brought back from Sydney, less the ""5 ounces"" AA kept for himself.

[489] I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that AA was purchasing methylamphetamine, in that he authorized AA to purchase the methylamphetamine on his behalf to deliver it back to him, for him to supply."" (emphasis added)

29These findings identify the quantity of drugs that his Honour found the appellant supplied as part of the sixth transaction as being the amount ""brought back from Sydney"". His Honour clarified his finding as follows:

""491. I have no doubt that AA obtained substantial quantities of methylamphetamine on his behalf before 8/9 May 2008. The reality is that, as was submitted by his counsel, there is absent in relation to the previous supplies clear 'independent' evidence of the quantities of methylamphetamine purchased on his behalf by AA. I can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence that the balance of the 'bad ice' in AA's possession was that provided by 'Uncle'. But in the absence of any independent evidence to support AA's version in the manner consistent with the warnings I adopt, exercising the caution required, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the precise quantity obtained on behalf of the accused by AA beyond that amount found. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there was 'more' than those amounts relevantly 'supplied' by the accused. But the quantities can only be speculated about and not identified with the precision required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that AA purchased methylamphetamine for the accused on each of the other dates claimed by AA. This is not effectively denied by the accused. The precise amounts purchased by AA for the accused, other than those recovered by the police enquiries from 9 May onwards, cannot be determined beyond reasonable doubt. As the accused was dealing in 'ice' through April May, clearly he and AA supplied more methylamphetamine than that found by police. However, the precise quantity cannot be identified. Adding up what is known with precision from what was found by police does not amount to a kilogram or more of the prohibited drug. One cannot fill the 'gap' with speculation as to the quantities obtained by AA and sold by the accused."" (emphasis added)

30Thus, in considering what quantity of methylamphetamine the appellant supplied, his Honour was only prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt he supplied the quantity that they located in the searches that were conducted on 9 May 2008. This included the remnants of ""Uncle's bad ice"" from the fourth transaction (118 grams) and the balance of the ice from the sixth transaction found in the Vodafone bag in the white bucket (413 grams) which included 28 grams of epsom salts. As those amounts exceeded 250 grams, but was less than one kilogram, his Honour found that the appellant was guilty of supplying not less than a commercial quantity but was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the amount supplied exceeded a large commercial quantity. In this regard his Honour's findings concerning the sixth transaction were critical since those findings supported the verdict and without them the appellant was entitled to be acquitted.

31Although it makes no difference to the verdict, in the sentence proceedings, the Crown submitted that the amount his Honour found (or ought to have found) that the appellant supplied was not less than 612 grams of methamphetamine. This was comprised of the 118.4 grams (being the remnants of ""Uncle's bad ice""), 413 grams less 28 grams of epsom salts, the 27.9 grams AA sold to Watt and the 140.6 grams found in the plastic bags in the safe less 59 grams (being the contents of one of the two-ounce bags). The deduction of the 28 grams epsom salts was favourable to the appellant given the admixture provision in s 4 of the DMTA. The inclusion of some of the drugs found in the safe involved a more adverse finding than that set out in the extract from the judgment noted in [29] above. In relation to that, the Crown pointed to evidence from AA that he intended to hold that part of those drugs for the appellant. Nothing turns on this. During the sentencing hearing the appellant's counsel accepted the Crown's approach. In the sentencing judgment his Honour recorded that ""the parties conceded that my findings indicated that the quality of methylamphetamine relevantly recovered on 9 May [2008] comprised approximately 612 to 620 grams"".

The Appellant's Case at Trial

32The trial judge's reasons contained a considered and comprehensive summary of the appellant's case ([61]-[86]). It included the following summary of his evidence ([67]-[85]):

""In 2006 he was renting a property opposite the '16 Footer's Club' at Belmont, living with his children and his daughter [ ]. He was a low level dealer in Indian hemp or cannabis and prescription drugs such as oxycontin and oxycodone however he had no involvement in the supply of 'ice' (methylamphetamine) until early February 2008. He said he met AA in either early 2006 or 2007 and understood AA was a friend of his daughter. He met him at his home opposite the 16 Footer's Club and bought some ice off him then. AA came to the house from the Club several times to sell ice to [his daughter].

He gave evidence about a number of calls intercepted by the police operation. Whilst he conceded from isolated references, it not being practical to go through every call, that many of the calls were related to the sale of prohibited drugs, he said that no calls related to the sale of ice until after 5 February 2008. Some of the calls before then would have related to the sale of hydroponic marijuana that he obtained from a man called Ricky Lovejoy, who lived at Freemans Waterhole. 

He first met AA in 2008 at a shopping centre regularly referred to in the evidence as the 'Citi Centre'. He said AA came to his home and asked him if he was interested in buying 'ice' and he said to AA that he was interested in 'a gram'. He said that AA said to him that he had a deal for him whereby the accused could give him $5,000, AA would 'score the drugs' and AA in repayment would give him back the cash plus an 8-ball, three and a half grams of ice. He said he went with AA and BB, in BB's car, to near the Pelican RSL. AA left the car and came back within about an hour and they returned to Orchard's house. He said he was given $2,000 and an 8-ball. He denied giving AA $64,000 to purchase methylamphetamine.

From there on he obtained methylamphetamine from AA on a regular basis. He would get '8-balls' for financing AA's puchases, AA continued to borrow money from him, no more than $5,000 at any one time. Ultimately, on 9 May, the accused said he was owed $10,000 by AA.

He gave evidence that he did not know the people that AA was associated with although he had heard of Tommy Gallagher. He received approximately 14 or 15 8-balls from AA and three or four 8-balls from Jon Pearman, a friend of his, and several 8-balls from 'Darren', which were all methylamphetamine. 

After receiving the first 8-ball from AA he started using ice regularly and he also sold it, making money out of it. He said, however, that his ice dependency grew over the months and he was ultimately using more than he was selling, although he referred to many occasions when he sold small amounts of ice to various people recorded in the telephone intercept operation as having called him. Initially he started using about a gram a week but, ultimately, he was using about two gram of ice a week maybe more. He drew a distinction between 'ice', which he understood was methylamphetamine, and 'speed' or 'glug speed' which he described as 'amphetamine'. 

Generally, he did not dispute in his evidence that the times that AA said that he delivered methylamphetamine to him occurred. However, he disputed the quantities supplied. He denied ever giving AA the sums of money that AA claimed he received in late February, late March, mid April and early May 2008. He denied every receiving large quantities of 'ice' from 'Uncle' and denied leaving drugs at the home of AA after Tristan Lightfoot had been arrested on 21 April 2008. 

... He gave evidence about the meaning of communications between AA and him and said amongst other things that the series of communications between himself and AA, when AA went missing in late March early April, were largely prompted by the fact that he, the accused, was badly affected by 'ice'. ...

He said of AA that he did not 'particularly' trust him and that after a little while he did not trust him at all. One of the reasons that he was 'concerned' about AA was because AA brought around to his home a machine pistol which later he saw a photograph of in the local newspaper. 

He said that a particular call on 7 May 2008 where he told BB that he needed AA to bring around 'the rest of the flowers' and to bring round 'the red one', was a reference to marijuana with red hairs on it not the reddish brown 'ice', that was subsequently found by police in their search of AA's home on 9-10 May 2008. 

He gave evidence as well about the various messages exchanged on 9 May, indicating that he was not that experienced in sending text messages, but he was not showing any form of 'supervisory' interest, in relation to AA's activities. He said in his evidence that he did not know who AA was dealing with in Sydney. In fact, he knew very little about AA's activities when he said he was 'going south'. 

He was taken to the listening device 'material', being recorded conversations in his motor vehicle between 11 April 2008 and 22 April 2008 concerning dealings he had with various individuals, as well as the recorded conversation between himself and AA of 4 May 2008. Whilst he admitted that a number of these conversations were concerned with selling prohibited drugs, there were no major 'deals'."" 

33It was not suggested that any aspect of this summary of the appellant's evidence was incorrect. Thus the appellant accepted that he used and supplied drugs but claimed that the relationship between himself and AA was, in effect, the opposite of that alleged by the Crown. The Crown contended that AA was acting at the behest of the appellant and was his intermediary in procuring large supplies of ice. Its case accommodated AA selling some drugs on the side whilst asserting that the appellant was the dominant retailer in the area. The appellant contended that AA was the retail supplier and he was one of AA's clients while accepting that he sold drugs on the side.

34His Honour comprehensively rejected the appellant's evidence ([277], [278], [320], [356], [399], [408], [455], [485] to [486]). His Honour explained his reasons for doing so. In large part his Honour considered it was inconsistent with the various forms of surveillance evidence and was in other respects internally inconsistent. Aspects of the surveillance evidence are described below. However his Honour also noted that much of the appellant's evidence was in its ""detail and in [its] presentation"" a ""contrivance"" ([399]). This was in part the result of an assessment that, as the trial judge, his Honour was able to undertake by considering the manner in which the appellant gave his evidence. This was an advantage his Honour enjoyed that this Court did not.

The Conduct of the Defence Case 

35To this point in describing the appellant's ""case"" we have summarised his evidence. However in view of the matters raised on his behalf on the appeal it is necessary to refer to aspects of how his case was conducted. 

36The presentation of the Crown case occupied 81 days of hearing time. In the circumstances explained below, the appellant dismissed his counsel (the ""first counsel"") on the 77th day of the trial. New counsel assumed the conduct of his case until verdict. That counsel appeared on the appeal.

37The 81 days of the Crown case included a significant number of days where evidence was taken on the voir dire and other evidentiary applications were made as well as numerous applications for the trial judge to disqualify himself. None of these rulings were challenged on the appeal. However by far the longest part of the Crown case was the period in which the Crown's principal witness, ""AA"", was cross-examined. AA gave evidence in chief over seven days from 27 October 2010 to 4 November 2010. He was then cross-examined over 23 hearing days from 15 November 2010 to 4 February 2011. The cross-examination was interrupted by a six-week adjournment of the proceedings from mid-December 2010 to February 2011. In large part the cross-examination consisted of the playing of recordings of various telephone calls in open court and then AA being asked various questions. Sometimes the same subject matter would be returned to days later. 

38The theme of the cross-examination was the proposition that AA was a substantial drug dealer in his own right and had contacts with a number of persons other than the appellant who might have financed the various purchases the subject of the six transactions relied upon by the Crown. However, what remained elusive throughout this aspect of the cross-examination was the appellant's response to the specific and incriminating aspects of AA's evidence and the surveillance evidence that implicated him.

39It was not until 9 February 2011, when the first counsel first put a number of affirmative propositions to AA, occupying slightly over one page of transcript, that it was put to AA that in the period January to May 2008 he sold the appellant no more than 80 grams of ""ice"" and the largest single quantity was an ounce. It was also put, that on two or three occasions, AA supplied the appellant with marijuana and also supplied him with ""gas"" (amphetamine). It was put that the appellant never supplied AA with a gun, as AA claimed, and that they did not have a conversation in gaol as AA had claimed. Nothing else was put to contradict AA's evidence. 

40In an ensuing discussion, the Crown queried the extent of the matters that had been expressly put to AA on behalf of the appellant. The trial judge stated he was not going to direct that any aspect of the defence case be put to AA in the absence of knowing what the defence case was. The first counsel indicated that she wished to consider the matter further.

41On the next day, 10 February 2011, she had AA re-called and cross-examined him further. However the only additional matters put to AA were as follows:

""Q. I put to you that you also sold him quantities of marijuana, smaller than a pound at times, what do you say to that?
A. Never, never.

Q. I put to you that Mr Orchard never asked you to go purchase methylamphetamine on his behalf, what do you say about that?
A. Always.

Q. I put to you that you were a drug supplier and Mr Orchard was one of your many customers, what do you say to that?
A. No."" (emphasis added)

42Thus, although the first counsel put some very broad propositions to AA she did not challenge AA about any conversation or meeting that he claimed he had with the appellant other than a particular conversation in gaol. As the summary of the appellant's evidence set out above (at [32]) makes clear, he claimed there were a number of significant disputes between them, one being their respective versions of what occurred during their meeting on the evening of 8 May 2008 (see [75] to [76] below).

43It has been accepted that there is a rule of professional practice, said to be based on the decision in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67, that, subject to various qualifications, a cross-examiner must put to a witness the matters in respect of which it is intended the witness's evidence will be contradicted (R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 686D per Gleeson CJ, with whom McInerney J agreed). The continuing application of this rule to criminal trials has been doubted (MWJ v R [2005] HCA 74; 80 ALJR 329 at [40]), however its application was recently assumed by this Court in Lysle v R [2012] NSWCCA 20 at [40]. A potential consequence of a failure by counsel for the accused to put a matter to a prosecution witness about which the accused later testifies is that it can be a basis for the Crown to contend that that aspect of the accused's evidence is a recent invention (see Birks at 690 to 692 per Gleeson CJ; Llewellyn v R [2011] NSWCCA 66 at [137(c)] per Garling J; and Lysle at [35]; although compare Llewellyn at [138(d)] with Lysle at [41] to [45]). As there may be many reasons why a matter was not put to a witness, a process of reasoning that relies on that fact to allow for a finding adverse to an accused must be approached with caution (Llewellyn at [138(b)] per Garling J and cases cited thereat; and R v Giourtalis [2013] NSWCCA 216 at [45] per Bathurst CJ). If counsel for the accused is confronted with the suggestion that their client has recently invented some detail that was not put to a Crown witness, or that is put to an accused in cross-examination, and if the failure to put it was an oversight or mistake on counsel's part, then a number of responses are available (Birks at 683B). They include re-examining the accused on his or her instructions to counsel (Llewellyn at [58]), calling the instructing solicitor to testify as to the accused's instructions, or counsel returning their brief and giving evidence as to their instructions and acknowledging error on their part (Birks at 683C).

44While that is not this case, and while it may be that in a particular circumstance Browne v Dunn has little or no place in drawing an inference adverse to an accused, a failure to comply with the rule may nevertheless have an effect on an accused's credit. It may also be relevant in circumstances where an allegation of counsel's incompetence is said to give rise to a miscarriage of justice.

45We can conceive of a situation where the matters that were put (or not put) to AA in cross-examination may have raised a potential problem for the appellant if he later gave evidence which contradicted AA's account. However a much larger problem was raised by the positive proposition that was put to AA by the appellant's first counsel that he never asked AA to purchase methylamphetamine on his behalf, since this was directly inconsistent with the evidence that the appellant later gave (and appears to have been inconsistent with what had been put to AA by counsel on the previous day). Thus for example, in his evidence in chief the appellant stated as follows concerning a drug deal he arranged with AA around 5 April 2008:

""Q. Had you made an arrangement for him [AA] to supply you with some drugs?
A. Yes.

Q. What were you getting?
A. We'd be getting 8-balls supposedly, my money back, the 5000, and there had been discussion about how he was going to clear up the other money he owed me. Probably going to be a pound of hydro.""

The reference to ""8-balls"" was to a quantity of ""ice"".

46Similarly, in reference to a meeting between the appellant and AA on the evening of 8 May 2008 just prior to the sixth transaction being completed, the appellant stated:
""Q. What was your understanding, what did you want, what were you going to ask for [from AA]?
A.Well I definitely wanted an 8-ball of ice.""

47A barrister would breach a professional obligation if he or she knowingly asserted a fact to a witness in cross-examination that is directly inconsistent with their instructions. The position the defence is faced with where an accused gives evidence that is wholly inconsistent with a positive assertion that has been put to a Crown witness is potentially more damaging to an accused's case than where the accused's version has not been put to a witness. In that event there is reduced scope for the fact finder to consider the possibility that the discrepancy between what was put to the witness and testified to by the accused was the result of an oversight by counsel, or of the accused, or the result of forgetfulness or lack of attention to detail. It is far more likely to be found to be the consequence of either the client changing their instructions or counsel breaching their ethical obligations.

48For present purposes, it is only necessary to note that, following the completion of the cross-examination of AA, the position confronting the appellant was that if he proposed to give evidence at variance with what was put to AA by his counsel, and if he gave evidence contrary to those parts of AA's evidence that were not challenged, then there was the real potential for the Crown to submit that his evidence was a recent invention designed to meet the Crown case that had by that time gathered in weight and import. If such a suggestion were made, his first counsel would have been placed in a difficult ethical position (see above at [43]). In the events that happened, by the time the appellant gave evidence, she had ceased to appear for him and his evidence was not challenged on that basis. However, the potential for such a challenge to have been made is important in considering the possible reasons for the accused withdrawing his instructions, a matter which is at the heart of ground 5A of the appeal, which will be dealt with in detail later in this judgment. 

The Surveillance Material

49As stated, his Honour considered closely the surveillance material that was tendered concerning the appellant and AA. The critical findings, especially in relation to the sixth transaction, were as follows:

""481 The pattern of intercepted calls on the combined telephone intercepts of the accused's telephone services and the telephone services of AA and BB, confirm a special arrangement between AA and the accused. The relationship is consistent with a process of obtaining money for significant drug purchases, reporting to the accused about the progress of those purchases and delivering back to the accused the results of ""missions"" to purchase significant quantities of methylamphetamine confirmed by the events of 9 May. There is no such consistent pattern of calls from AA to other people of this character.

482 The Crown's submissions regarding the lack of contact between AA and Gallagher between 28 April and 8 May, undercut any reasonable possibility that Gallagher funded the mission to Sydney which resulted in the purchase of the methylamphetamine found by the police after the arrests on 9 May. The telephone call between AA and Gallagher at 7:59 pm on 9 May shows clearly no direct 'interest', by Gallagher in the purchase from Paxton which had already occurred which AA was returning to Belmont. There is no reasonable evidence that any person to whom AA supplied drugs, in the period between 11 April and 9 May, had the capacity and/or did, in fact, finance any particular purchase over that period of time, including Chad Graham.""

50Given that one of the grounds contends that the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence, it is necessary to consider the surveillance material that supports these findings in some detail, at least so far as it concerns the sixth transaction given that the findings His Honour made in respect of that transaction is the basis for the finding of guilt.

51The surveillance material that was tendered at the trial included a large number of discs containing recordings of numerous telephone conversations involving various people involved in, or said by the Crown to be involved in, drug supply or purchase, transcripts of many of those conversations and ""sms"" messages passing between them and others, transcripts of listening device recordings from the appellant's car and various data obtained from tracking devices placed on the vehicles of AA and the appellant. The Crown prepared a summary, which was a (partial) chronological summary of the various telephone conversations and sms messages. 

52The defence also tendered various recordings and messages involving AA in an endeavour to demonstrate that he was the principal in the various transactions and otherwise had access to persons, other than the appellant, who could have been the source of the finance for the various drug purchases. The defence also provided its own summary to the trial judge.

53The following incorporates the calls and messages relied on by both the Crown and the defence.

54In the period from the evening of 7 May 2008 to the middle of 9 May 2008 there was an intense level of communication between AA and Paxton consistent with their attempts to consummate a very sizable purchase of drugs. As noted, the trial judge also considered that there was an absence of any relevant contact between AA and any person other than the appellant who could potentially finance such a purchase. 

55The negotiations between AA and Paxton, for what became the sixth transaction, commenced on or around 27 April 2008. By 4.14pm on 29 April 2008 they had reached the point that Paxton sent AA a text stating ""Hi mate only 1 that good 4 tonight is 120 or 230"" (call 2169). The Crown submitted that this was a reference to a price of $120,000 for half a kilogram of ice or $230,000 for a kilogram. AA responded with a text stating ""[s]orry bro ill have 2 talk 2 mate 1st cos pretty high there, if 110 yes but have 2 c him 1st ..."" (call 2171). The Crown case was that the reference to ""mate"" was to the appellant and the text involved AA holding out for a price of $110,000 for a half a kilogram. 

56Paxton and AA continued to exchange SMS messages on a regular basis over the next few days, one topic of which concerned the price of supply. On 30 April 2008 at 10.47pm AA and Paxton had a conversation which was generally unintelligible but included a discussion about price coded as a discussion about AA visiting Paxton (call 2376). It concludes with AA asking Paxton to send him a ""house number [and] address"". Fifteen minutes later Paxton sent AA a text that read ""Unit 110 its [sic] the nice building inside and out"" (call 2377). The Crown contended that this revealed AA and Paxton agreeing on a price of $110,000. 

57Late in the evening on 30 April 2008, AA telephoned Lightfoot and discussed the latter's arrest (call 2383). Lightfoot explained that he was arrested ""just up the road from ... old mate"". As noted Lightfoot was arrested near the appellant's house.

58Having negotiated the terms of the deal, AA then stalled Paxton. Very early on 1 May 2008, he messaged Paxton stating that his ""other half [i.e. his partner], he is in hospital"" and had a broken leg (call 2389). Later that day AA telephoned the appellant. The appellant said he was at the chemist and ""struggling"" - a reference to the problem with his leg. AA told him ""we need to do something ... we really need to do something but ..."".

59On 2 May 2008 at 1.43pm AA spoke to Chad Graham. AA told Graham that ""[t]he one we have been waiting for - it's here"" but that ""it depends if the cripple can get his part of the deal"". In evidence AA said that the latter statement was a reference to the appellant's ""part of the money"" and he referred to the appellant as ""the cripple"" because he had difficulty moving. At 2.30pm the appellant called AA and told him his ""legs [were] just about right"". At 2.52pm the appellant telephoned AA and asked him to bring ""one of them T-shirts"" (call 331). In evidence AA stated that this was a reference to an ""ounce or bag of ice or gas"". Surveillance photographs show AA attending the appellant's home at 3.08pm and leaving at 3.15pm ([468]).

60During this period AA was continually texting Paxton and indicating that he would be coming to complete the deal shortly. At 3.37pm on 2 May 2007 Paxton messaged AA stating ""so 40 is that right"" in an apparent reference to 40 ounces. At 6.20pm AA called Paxton to explain the delay on his side of the deal. He stated, inter alia: ""I should [have] already left by now, I know. Um he's not going to be here till seven o'clock with the ... rest of the money"". It is noteworthy that from the time this call ended until 8.27pm AA unsuccessfully attempted to call the appellant seven times. At 9.36pm Paxton sent a message to AA asking him to call (call 2683). At 9.38pm AA spoke to another associate, Lee Murnain (also known as Choung). He told Murnain that he had ""dramas"" and that he ""just [had] to sought [sic] something"".

61At 9.43pm on 2 May 2008 Paxton and AA finally spoke to each other. AA blamed the difficulty in consummating the deal on the person who was ""on crutches"", adding that he was ""travelling through the bush you know what I mean"" (call 2686). As stated, the appellant had injured his leg around this time.

62During the afternoon until late in the evening on 2 May 2008 AA spoke to BB on a number of occasions. Allowing for the variety of drug codes in play, none of these calls included any reference to the financing of drug purchases or the pending deal with Paxton. AA also exchanged brief texts with a contact, Dale Thrift, during this period. However Thrift was an unlikely source of funds given that he had texted AA at 12.13pm that day stating ""I need coin bad"". There is nothing in the texts that suggests any attempt by AA to source funds from him or anyone associated with him.

63At 5.47pm on 2 May 2008 another associate, Mark Taylor, spoke to AA (call 2629). Taylor advised AA that he had ""about a thousand bucks of battery for [him]"". In his evidence AA stated that this was a reference to actual batteries obtained from dubious sources and he was seeking to swap them for drugs. AA replied that ""I can't do nothing at the moment cause I'm not home"" but that ""maybe [I can] when I get home or in the morning"". Even if the reference to ""thousand bucks of battery"" was to cash and not batteries, this response is entirely inconsistent with AA seeking to finance any part of the purchase price for the sixth transaction from Taylor. AA needed cash to complete the deal immediately. If Taylor was a source of finance for the deal he would not have put him off until the next day. 

64AA also exchanged text messages with Steven Haiduk (or ""Budge"") on the evening of 2 May 2008. It appears they met shortly afterward and AA provided him a ""shot"" of drugs. We will return to discuss Haiduk. The timing of his meeting with AA appears to have occurred prior to AA's attempts to contact the appellant, suggesting that it was the latter and not anything said during the former as what AA was referring to in his discussion with Choung, and caused him to put off buying the drugs from Paxton. Otherwise it is noteworthy that there were no calls between either AA or BB on the one hand and Gallagher on the other in this period. 

65By the evening of 5 May 2008 AA was clearly agitated about stalling the completion of the sixth transaction. At 6.17pm he telephoned Chad Graham (call 3063). The transcript of that call records the following exchange:

""[AA]: He's a paranoid fuck, fair dinkum.
[Graham]: Yeah. It's a worry isn't it?

[AA]: Ah mate. All for fucking nothing.
[Graham]: Your joking.

[AA]: Nah. All because of that Tristan fuck wit mate.
[Graham]: Yeah, oh yeah yeah. I know what you mean now. Fucking hell.

[AA]: Tell me about it.
[Graham]: So what, ah. How long is he going to keep this fucking shit up for?

[AA]: Ah fucked if I know. He said another few days or a week maybe.
[Graham]: Fuck off.

[AA]: So now I'm just going to have to ring the boys and tell them fucking the truth.
[Graham]: Yeah.

[AA]: That my partner is a paranoid spinner and he is fucking losing the plot. Ah and hopefully in a few days, or a week, we will see you.
[Graham]: Fucking, ah. All the cunt has got to do, is to go and get it.

[AA]: Yep. But he reckons that that's what they are waiting for."" (emphasis added)

66In his evidence in chief AA explained that the person referred to as paranoid was the appellant and that the paranoia arose out of the arrest of Lightfoot, a matter that has been discussed above at [20]. He said that the reference to ""ring the boys and tell the truth"" was a reference to telling Paxton the truth about his difficulty in getting funds from the appellant. He explained that the reference to ""what they are waiting for"" was to the appellant having told him that if he simply went and collected the money for the transaction he would be arrested.

67At 1.10pm on the afternoon of 7 May 2008 the appellant rang AA but the call was unanswered. Four minutes later he sent a text stating ""[n]eed 2 c u"". AA replied: ""On the way back from the bay but will c[ome] straight 2 u"". At 3.15pm the appellant rang AA's phone. BB answered. The appellant told her that: ""I need him to bring around the rest of them flowers now"". He rang back 44 minutes later to see where they were. The appellant told BB to ""tell [AA] its [sic] the red one I want to look at"" (call 3326). Surveillance photos showed AA arriving at the appellant's house at around 4.23pm and leaving shortly afterwards.

68On the evening of 7 May 2013 AA at 6.47pm left a message on Paxton's phone apologising for the delay and stating that his ""partner"" had been ""spinning out"". Paxton rang him back immediately. He told AA that he had ""missed some good times buddy"" but the ""ship is sailing"" i.e. the deal had been in jeopardy but was still on track. In a reference to his ""partner"", AA said ""he has just been wigging out on me like paranoiding out right"". Paxton suggested that AA ""go solo"" but AA stated that he ""[had not] quite got the funds"" and ""that's where [he was] the last couple of days ... by his [i.e. his partner's] side ... trying to show him ... [e]verything is sweet"".

69Not surprisingly the surveillance material reveals a heightened intensity in the communications between AA and Paxton from late in the afternoon of 8 May through to 9 May 2008. What is significant is the juxtaposition of those communications with the contact between AA and the appellant.

70At 9.16am on 8 May 2008 BB and Graham spoke on the telephone (call 1718). BB told Graham that AA had gone to Gallagher's place. At 9.39am Haiduk called AA (call 3384). Haiduk explained that he was attending court on a charge of drive while disqualified. Haiduk said something to the effect that ""he had a go the other morning but it was no good because there were too many people around"" and that ""he has some stuff in boxes"" for AA. AA told Haiduk he was traveling to Maitland, where Gallagher lived. He also said he ""love[d] boxes"". In cross-examination AA stated that he could not recall what the reference to the boxes was or if he ever received them. He understood them to be the reference to the proceeds of some sort of robbery or theft. A detective gave evidence that Haiduk was charged with various offences concerning stolen tool boxes.

71Between 2.43pm and 6.18pm on 8 May 2013 AA spoke to Paxton on the phone four times. In the first conversation AA states that he cannot leave Newcastle ""until tea time"" and then later ""until about five"" (call 3442). In the second call AA nominates ""eighteen or twenty"" ounces as the amount he is seeking. In the next call he confirms that ""he can't get the full"", i.e. he cannot afford a full kilogram. 

72At 6.02pm on 8 May 2013 AA received a call from Haiduk's number (call 3475). In his evidence he agreed that he spoke with another associate nicknamed ""Buns"". AA told the caller that he was ""going on a mission"" to Sydney. The caller asks when they are leaving and AA replied that they would leave when they dropped off BB's daughter they were going. They then discuss meeting at AA's home, although when is not clear. AA received a call from Haiduk (aka ""Budge"") eighteen minutes later, in which the caller tells AA that ""Marky"" cannot come and inquires when another person (""Gnome"") can (call 3480). AA explained that this was a reference to ""Mark Taylor"" coming to his home and not travelling to Sydney with him. 

73At 6.24pm on 8 May 2008 AA telephoned the appellant's phone but the call was answered by the appellant's son. His son told AA that the appellant was at his grandparents' house, i.e. the house on Tudor Street, and gave him the telephone number. At 6.35pm AA rang that number and spoke to the appellant. They arranged to meet at the appellant's home at Vista Parade. A tracking device on the appellant's car records his car being at his grandparents' house from 6.11pm and returning to Vista Parade at 7.44pm ([473]). 

74Between 7.38pm and 7.42pm BB made a number of telephone calls to the appellant. At 7.46pm the appellant rang BB and asked if she had been trying to call. She replied that she had. She said that she had been trying to see if he was home and that ""we'll see you soon"" (i.e. AA and BB).

75In his evidence AA recounted attending the appellant's house on Tudor Street on the evening of 8 May 2008 and receiving $110,000 from the appellant, as well as around $800 to $1,000 in ""travel money"". AA said that Graham was waiting around the corner. He said they then picked up BB. He said that, while Graham drove, he and BB counted the money in the back of the car. BB's evidence was that she went to the house with AA and collected the money.

76It is important to note the appellant's evidence about this meeting. He said that, on the evening of 8 May 2008, AA and BB came to his house and he gave AA $5,000. The appellant had stated that on previous occasions he had given AA $5,000 to purchase ice which he was still owed. However he said this occasion was a ""bit different from other times"". He said that in return he ""definitely wanted an 8-ball of ice"" and ""[to get] the rest of the money back in whatever form, as long as [he] got it back. [AA] told me he was getting ice and pot"". 

77Critically, at 8.47pm AA messaged Paxton telling him ""Sorry bro, running bout hr late but we r on our way. Phone b off til we arrive. C u soon"". Thus, immediately after attending the appellant's house, AA left for Sydney to complete the purchase from Paxton. At 10.17pm they had still not arrived. Paxton messaged AA complaining about his phone being turned off. At 10.18pm AA replied that ""road works"" had delayed them but they were ""only 10 away now. C u in min"". Within seconds they spoke on the phone. AA explained the delay on the road. Paxton explained that his source would not wait. By 10.34pm AA messaged Paxton to the effect that he was at the front of his premises at Balmain.

78At 12.39am on 9 May 2008 AA sent the appellant a text stating: ""Hey mate, we got here n shop was shut so we r staying the nite. We'll have a rest n b home in morn, k?"". 

79According to AA he made contact with Paxton that night. At some point he, Graham and BB went to a casino. They returned to Paxton's house around 3.00am. AA said they were given a sample of the drugs by Paxton. He said BB wanted to go home so they drove back to Newcastle that morning, arriving at around 5.00am ([46]). He said that he and Graham left Newcastle around 8.00am and drove back to Balmain ([46]). He described collecting the drugs from Paxton and his associates. He received ten pounds of marijuana in the morning. Later in the afternoon Paxton met his contact and returned with the red vodaphone bag and told him that ""[t]here were 20 ounces [of methylamphetamine] in there"". AA said that he and Graham packed their car and left. We have described AA's evidence as to what they did with the drugs when they returned to Newcastle above at [26].

80The surveillance material is all consistent with this account. There are a large number of messages between Paxton and AA in the early hours of 9 May 2008. They refer to AA and others being at the casino and them making arrangements for them to meet. They confirm that BB wanted to return to Newcastle and that AA stated they would return in the morning. They also confirm that AA arrived back at the front of Paxton's premises at 10.27am on 9 May 2008. At 3.19pm Paxton telephoned AA and told him they he would be ""half an hour to an hour max"". This was a reference to the delay in delivering the methylamphetamine. 

81The surveillance material tendered by the defence included a message sent by Haiduk to AA at 3.47am on 9 May 2008 asking AA to ""ring me very important"". AA telephoned Haiduk at 5.34am. Haiduk told him that he had ""lost five car loads"" to the ""dogs"". In cross-examination AA agreed that he sounded ""disappointed"" during the call on hearing this. The nature and timing of the call suggest that, while it involved some nefarious enterprise, it was not the enterprise the subject of this appeal. By the time of this call AA had the funds to purchase the drugs and had already travelled to Sydney (before returning because BB wanted to come home). The sale had only been frustrated because of a difficulty on the supply side. 

82At 4.47pm on 9 May 2008 the appellant telephoned AA. At this time AA was still at Paxton's house, but was about to leave with the drugs purchased in the sixth transaction. The call included the following exchange:

""[Appellant]: Hey mate, yeah, listen I won't be home when you get home. [The Appellant then described how he had to take his son to football]
[AA]: ... we're on our way back now.
.......

[Appellant]: Righto ah, I got to take him so he can play football, I won't be home when you get there anyway, but I'll be, not too far away, okay.""

83Between 7.08pm and 7.16pm the appellant and AA exchanged text messages updating the appellant on where AA was on his journey from Balmain to Sydney.

84At 7.59pm on 9 May 2008 AA telephoned Gallagher (i.e. ""Uncle""). It is notable that this is the first telephone call between AA and Gallagher since he commenced negotiating the sixth transaction. In view of the suggestion raised at the trial that Gallagher was a potential source of the funds for the sixth transaction, it is appropriate to set out the relevant part of this conversation:

""[Gallagher]: Would you, did you want to pick up one of them beers for yourself, one of those cases for yourself did ya?

[AA]: Yeah I did yeah.
[Gallagher]: I can organise me mate.

[AA]: Oh yeah yeah.
[Gallagher]: Yeah I can organise him for ya.

[AA]: Mad. That would be good. Um I got them a couple of things for ya too.
[Gallagher]: Oh did ya?

[AA]: Yeah, that tool kit.
[Gallagher]: Nah, I thought you must not have worried, then with it being so long ...

[AA]: ... yeah no, there was a problem with my end, me mate up here, yeah ...
[Gallagher]: ... ah yeah ...

[AA]: Yeah it's all good now. I went and seen him today, yeah but, one of them slabs for me would be alright.
[Gallagher]: Yeah, yeah I don't [have] them now that's all.

[AA]: Yeah right.
[Gallagher]: But it doesn't matter ...

[AA]: ... ah that's not a problem, that's not a problem ...
[Gallagher]: No, I'll still take them, I don't want to fuck you around, I thought that it must not have worked out, you know and then ...

[AA]: Yeah nah, it was just a bit of a delay.
[Gallagher]: Yeah.

[AA]: Bit of a delay. Nah it's sorted. But yeah, there's no dramas, no pressure or nothing, yeah. But I wouldn't mind one of them slabs for me.
[Gallagher]: Yeah, no, we can organise that, I'd just rather talk to you about the other thing when I get back you know.""

85The conversation concludes with AA making arrangements to meet with Watt. He did so around 9.00pm but, as noted, was arrested. AA explained that he ""never got the chance"" to provide the ice he received to the appellant. 

86In cross-examination AA explained that the reference to a ""couple of things for ya too"" in the conversation with Gallagher was to a ""couple of ounces of ice"" and the suggestion by Gallagher that he ""pick up one of them beers for yourself"" was to an ounce of the ""brown"" or ""bad"" ice already noted. AA was not sure if the reference to ""him"" in ""went and seen him today"" was to Paxton or the appellant although until that time he had not seen the appellant. 

87A number of critical points emerge from this material. First it suggests that AA did not have the means to finance the purchase in his own right. The appellant submitted that AA was a ""substantial intermediate level drug dealer"". There is no doubt that he undertook some dealing, but this evidence reveals he could not finance the purchase from Paxton. AA had settled the terms with Paxton at a relatively early point and from then on stalled Paxton. This was not a tactic designed to obtain a better deal. AA did not attempt to renegotiate. His stalling of Paxton was clearly causing him considerable stress which he expressed to Graham and Choung (see [59], [60] and [65] above). Ultimately, on the evening of 7 May 2008, he told Paxton he needed funds from his ""partner"" (see [68] above).

88Second, AA described himself as having a ""partner"" and otherwise consistently alluded to the role of someone else as the financier of the purchase (see [58], [59], [61], [65] and [68] above). His description and references to the partner were clearly a reference to the appellant. It was the appellant who was experiencing the difficulties with his leg. It was the appellant who was concerned for his position after Lightfoot was arrested in possession of drugs after leaving his premises. 

89Third, the juxtaposition of the messages between the appellant and AA on the evening of 8 May 2008, the visit of AA to the appellant's house and then AA's immediate departure to purchase the drugs that night is compelling. On 2 May 2008 AA had told Paxton that he would be departing from Balmain. He then made seven unanswered calls to the appellant. Having been unsuccessful in contacting the appellant, he called off the journey to Sydney to complete the purchase. On the evening of 8 May 2008 he successfully contacted the appellant, visited his home and then immediately left for Sydney.

90As noted, ultimately there was no dispute at the trial that the appellant gave AA money during that visit to purchase drugs. The only real dispute was over the amount of money handed over. The amount suggested by the appellant, $5,000, was an insignificant proportion of a purchase price of $110,000, bearing in mind the latter amount is consistent with the amount of drugs found at AA's premises on the day of his arrest. The proposition that AA stalled the entire deal because he had access to $105,000 but was just waiting on the last $5,000 before immediately driving to Balmain is simply not credible. To the contrary the circumstances overwhelmingly point to AA obtaining the funds from the appellant. 

91Fourth, the events immediately after AA allegedly obtained funds from the appellant also serve to identify him as the financier. AA sent him a message when he arrived in Sydney updating him (""shop was shut""; see [78] above). AA's immediate response on returning to Newcastle with the drugs the next afternoon was to contact the appellant and arrange to meet him later that night (see [82] above).

92Fifth, consistent with the trial judge's observation, the surveillance material confirms the absence of any person with whom AA was in contact, other than the appellant, as a potential source of finance for the sixth transaction.

93It is true that a number of people were in contact with AA throughout the period. Leaving aside BB, AA's communications with them clearly concerned the supply of small amounts of drugs and the parlaying of various stolen items. Exactly who was supplying whom with what is not clear but, as stated, there is no doubt that at some point AA was engaged in the retail supply of drugs. However, with two possible exceptions, none of these exchanges comes close to suggesting that the persons with whom AA was dealing were the financiers of the purchase from Paxton.

94The two possible alternative financiers that were repeatedly hinted at during the trial were Gallagher (or ""Uncle"") and Haiduk. However there are numerous difficulties in regarding either or both of them as full or partial financiers of the sixth transaction in contrast to the appellant.

95It has already been noted, at [65] above, that AA vented to Graham about the conduct of his ""partner"". This was clearly a reference to the appellant and not Gallagher or Haiduk. There was no obvious reason for AA to lay some false trail about his identity at that point.

96Further, there was an absence of any substantial contact with Gallagher at the critical stages of the deal. For example it was clear that AA was hoping to complete the purchase on the evening of 2 May 2008. There was no contact at all with Gallagher around that time. However AA made seven unsuccessful attempts to contact the appellant. Even allowing for the use of coded discussions, the interactions with Gallagher on 8 and 9 May 2008 are qualitatively different to those involving the appellant. The appellant closely monitored AA's journey. Gallagher did not. 

97Similarly, although Haiduk had regular contact with AA during the relevant period, the nature and timing of the contact was significantly different to that between the appellant and AA. The call made by Haiduk in the early hours of 9 May 2008 about the loss of ""five car loads"" suggests a concern about a completely different transaction to the pending purchase from Paxton. We have already referred to the strong coincidence in timing about the visit of AA to the appellant's house on the evening of 8 May 2008 and then his departure for Sydney. There is nothing similar for either Gallagher or Haiduk.

98Finally, neither Gallagher nor Haiduk appears to have exercised the control over AA the appellant exercised. As the occasion noted at [67] above suggests, AA contacted the appellant when the appellant required him. AA reported to the appellant when he arrived in Sydney on the night of 8 May 2008, and then again after the drugs were purchased.

99In his submissions on the appeal the appellant submitted that Owen Keely was a potential source of finance for the sixth transaction. There were some brief conversations and an exchange of sms messages between AA and Keeley in the period 5 to 9 May 2008. None of these conversations or messages appears to have any relevance to the sixth transaction, nor does their timing appear to suggest that Keeley had any role in that deal.

100Overall, a review of the communications supports the assessment of the trial judge in that part of his Honour's judgment extracted at [49] above.

Grounds 1 and 2: Alleged error in finding independent evidence to support AA and alleged failure of the trial judge to instruct himself that corroboration of the evidence of ""AA"" was required

101Ground 1 of the appeal contends that the trial judge erred in finding that there was independent evidence supporting the evidence of AA. Ground 2 contends that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct himself that corroboration of the evidence of AA was required before it could be acted upon. These grounds appear to raise questions of law alone. Leave to raise them is not required (Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5(1)(a)). They can be dealt with together.

102Sub-section 133(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the ""CPA"") required his Honour to include in his judgment the ""principles of law"" that his Honour applied and the ""findings of fact"" upon which his Honour relied. This required not just a bare statement of principles and findings but also a statement of the reasoning process that connected them and justified the findings and the verdict (Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at [28]). Sub-section 133(3) provides that if a warning were required to be given to a jury then his Honour was required to ""take the warning into account"". In this case, that required inclusion of a warning concerning the evidence of AA as one of the principles of law to be applied by his Honour sitting without a jury (Fleming at [32]). It also meant that his Honour had to provide reasons why, despite the warning, a particular verdict was reached (Fleming at [33]). We note that a failure to comply with ss 133(2) and 133(3) amounts to a wrong decision on a question of law for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (Fleming at [27]).

103A review of the conviction judgment reveals that the trial judge was fully aware of his obligations as a judge sitting without a jury and the mandatory requirements in s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Paragraphs 87 to 126 of the conviction judgment are entitled ""Legal Principles to be Applied"". They consist of an extensive discussion of the relevant principles appropriately crafted to the circumstances of this case. In relation to AA and (to a lesser extent) BB his Honour noted that they were both experienced in drug trafficking and were heavily drug dependent (at [112]). His Honour directed himself that he ""would need to scrutinise their evidence with great care to see if there is any evidence independent of both witnesses that supports their version of events"" (at [113]). His Honour also noted that care needed to be exercised ""before relying upon one such witness to support the other's account"" (at [114]), and listed a number of matters concerning AA and BB that warranted caution before using their evidence to ""cross support"" each other (at [115] to [117]). 

104Ultimately his Honour stated (at [121]):

""For the above reasons, and for others more specifically dealt with in the treatment of the evidence of these witnesses, I must scrutinise [AA and BB's] evidence with the greatest care and could only be satisfied of the respective witnesses' truthfulness and reliability, bearing in mind the matters above, where there was evidence independent of them, or 'directly' available from contemporaneously recorded events, such as telephone intercepts, listening device material, surveillance evidence and the like that supports their respective accounts. In so far as the Crown case is particularly reliant upon AA to prove particular transactions, it would be dangerous to convict the accused on his evidence unless it was clearly supported by evidence, other than that of BB."" (emphasis added)

105On the appeal the Crown contended, citing Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109, that this direction was far more favourable to the appellant than his entitlement to the warnings provided for in s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995. It is unnecessary to consider that submission further in circumstances where we are satisfied that the terms of the direction are free of error and in conformity with the warning his Honour was required to take into account under s 133(3) when considering AA and BB's evidence. That his Honour applied the direction is borne out by the approach he adopted in making factual findings concerning the first five transactions relied upon by the Crown in proof of guilt. The appellant's real complaint was the manner in which his Honour accepted that part of AA's evidence concerning the sixth transaction, notwithstanding this direction. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the appellant focused on the sixth transaction because, as we have observed, had his Honour not found that the appellant supplied 413 grams of methylamphetamine in that transaction, he was entitled to an acquittal.

106The appellant's complaint about the findings concerning the sixth transaction is twofold. First, he contended that his Honour either failed to comply with his own direction and did not rely on independent evidence to corroborate or confirm AA's evidence or, if his Honour did rely on evidence within that category, the reasoning process was not properly identified in the judgment. Second, it was contended that the trial judge committed various 'factual errors' which materially affected the matters he did identify as confirmatory or corroborative of AA's evidence.

107In relation to the first matter, the trial judge did not collate in a single paragraph or discrete section of the judgment all the confirmatory evidence he relied upon to support his findings relating to the sixth transaction. However, his Honour's obligation to make patent his reasoning process as required by Fleming did not require him to do so. We are satisfied that the evidence confirmatory of AA's evidence emerges from a consideration of the last part of the judgment in which his Honour made findings concerning all six transactions.

108The starting point is that it was not in issue that, by the time of the sixth transaction, the appellant was retailing methylamphetamine and that AA purchased some of the drug on the appellant's behalf. In particular we have already referred to the competing evidence concerning the visit of AA to the appellant's house on the evening of 8 May 2008. As stated, the real dispute concerned how much money the appellant gave AA on the evening of 8 May 2008 and whether it was for the specific purpose of purchasing a large quantity of methylamphetamine. If the amount were that nominated by AA (i.e. $110,000), or if there were no reasonable possibility to the contrary, then it would inevitably follow that it was for that specific purpose.

109We have already set out the two critical paragraphs in from the conviction judgment in relation to the sixth transaction at [28] and [29] above. As noted in [488] of the conviction judgment, his Honour accepted AA's evidence that the appellant gave him $110,000 on the evening of 8 May 2008 ""[n]otwithstanding the many warnings"" he had given himself about AA's evidence. At [491] of the conviction judgment his Honour found that the amount obtained by AA on behalf of the appellant was at least the amount found by the police at AA's premises during the raid on 9 May 2008.

110Thus one corroborative aspect of the findings in relation to the sixth transaction was the actual amount of drugs found at AA's premises on 9 May 2008. This needs to be considered with two further matters. The first was his Honour's earlier findings noted above at [49] concerning the surveillance evidence and the relationship between AA and the appellant which we have already addressed. They effectively exclude either AA or any person associated with AA (other than the appellant) as having funded the purchase of that amount of methylamphetamine. The second was the evidence of the finding of a large sum at the home of the appellant's parents in law which his Honour found was the appellant's, and which supported the Crown case that the appellant had the means to fund the purchase of the drugs that were found. 

111Further at [473] of the conviction judgment his Honour reasoned as follows:

""Significantly, at 6:24 pm on 8 May AA called the accused's landline and Denny Orchard told AA that his father was at his grandparent's place giving their phone number. AA called and spoke to Jean Bigelow and then spoke to the accused who said he would be half an hour ""As he had to pick his bloke up from football"". The vehicle tracking device records shows that the accused's car was at Tudor Street for fifty one minutes from 6:11 pm, arriving back at Vista Parade at 7:44 pm. The accused rang BB's number trying to contact AA. There were a number of unanswered calls made by BB to AA's mobile phone number and then the accused rang back (call 7.08 to 7.46 pm). Eventually, according to AA, he went to the accused's house, not with BB, and he was taken out into the backyard and the accused grabbed some bags out of the guttering. The accused gave evidence that AA was there with BB, the time he and AA went 'out the back'. The bags were taken inside and there were bundles of notes in $1,000 'lots'. They were not loose but not in bundles of 10 lots of $1,000 each. They were bundled similarly to the cash found at the Bigelows on 9 May by police. AA took the $110,000 back to his home, he claimed in his pockets. [His Honour then described BB's evidence of this meeting and continued ...] AA's inconsistency with BB and the accused I note, but it is not significant, in context. I have closely considered BB's accounts of being present in the car counting the money. Notwithstanding her inconstancies, noting her explanations and notwithstanding her general unreliability on detail, I accept she did count the cash with AA. Her evidence on this matter was adamant, unlike other aspects. Even if I was to reject her, and AA's account on this aspect, the totality of the other evidence establishes the accused as the financier of this trip."" (emphasis added)

112Although it is not clear from this paragraph, it was common ground on the appeal that the emphasised portion of this paragraph was intended by his Honour to be a reference to evidence given by AA about collecting money from the appellant at his house for the sixth transaction. The appellant complains that this erroneously describes the evidence given by AA on that topic, a matter to be addressed shortly. Leaving that aside, this passage reveals that his Honour also drew support for his acceptance of AA's evidence in relation to the sixth transaction from AA's statement that he was paid money from the appellant's stash of funds which was maintained in a similar manner to the stash that his Honour found the appellant maintained at the home of his parents in law in Tudor Street.

113Contrary to the appellant's submissions on this ground of appeal, it is clear that his Honour approached each transaction by considering not just whether there was objective evidence confirmatory or corroborative of AA's evidence generally, but whether there was evidence confirmatory of that part of AA's evidence which was to the effect that the appellant received or procured a particular quantity of methylamphetamine for the purposes of supply. With four of the transactions, his Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any particular quantity was received by the appellant. With two of the transactions his Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that methamphetamines were supplied, but only to the extent of the amount of drug seized on 9 May 2008. With the sixth transaction, the confirmatory material has been identified at [110] to [112] above. We cannot discern any error in his Honour's approach. It was not inconsistent with the direction that his Honour scrutinise the evidence of AA with appropriate care and caution.

114The remaining complaint of the appellant under this ground concerns the emphasised portion of the passage from [473] of the conviction judgment noted above at [111]. This passage is said to erroneously characterise AA's description of the manner in which the appellant stored his stash of funds. AA's evidence was that when he saw the money at the appellant's home most of it was bundled up in thousand dollar lots in groups of ten, but about a third of the money was loose in sandwich bags. AA stated that he and the appellant bundled up most of the remainder. In our view the only error (or potential error) in his Honour's characterisation at [473] is that the reference to the notes being ""not loose but not in bundles of 10 lots of $1000 each"" contains an additional ""not"". However, it is clear as we see it that his Honour intended to state the money was ""not loose but ... in bundles of 10 lots of $1000 each"", this being either a reference to the state of two thirds of the stash prior to AA rendering the appellant assistance, or all of it after he did. The critical point was that his Honour was entitled to draw support for his ultimate, albeit partial, acceptance of AA's evidence in relation to the sixth transaction from the similarity between the state of the stash observed by AA when he collected the funds from the appellant at his house, and the state of the appellant's stash of funds that was located at the home of his parents in law.

115We reject grounds 1 and 2.

Ground 3: Failure to give a Markuleski direction 

116Ground 3 alleges that his Honour erred in failing to direct himself in accordance with R v Markuleski ([2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82) to the effect that, if he had a reasonable doubt about the evidence of AA in relation to one particular transaction, he should have been reluctant to accept the evidence of AA in relation to the other transactions. The appellant's written submissions did not expand upon the bare assertion of error in those terms.

117Markuleski was an appeal against a conviction on an indictment charging multiple counts in circumstances where the appellant was acquitted of all but one count. The Court was required to address an issue which had arisen in a number of cases where different verdicts were returned on an indictment alleging multiple counts, but where the verdicts depended upon the evidence of one complainant. Spigelman CJ discussed the circumstances in which a direction should or might be given to a jury to the effect that if they entertained a doubt about a complainant's evidence in relation to one count, that doubt must be taken into account in assessing the complainant's evidence generally. Thus Spigelman CJ stated at [186] to [191]:

""[186] In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence with respect to any count. 

[187] Some form of direction assisting the jury in this respect should be given, to employ the terminology found in Kilby and Davies 'as a general rule'. Its absence is not necessarily fatal (as it was not in Davies itself). Furthermore, as the joint judgment in Crofts affirmed, the 'general rule' does not apply 'where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness' (at 451). 

[188] It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant's evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant's evidence generally. 

[189] On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count. 

[190] Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant's credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 

[191] The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts.""

118In Hajje v R [2006] NSWCCA 23 at [100] Simpson J observed that the principles for which Markuleski is authority are not confined to cases of inconsistent verdicts, but are capable of general application in that, in an appropriate case, a jury should be directed that where they have a doubt about one aspect of a witness's evidence it ought to be taken into account when assessing that witness's evidence on other matters. Thus in Hajje at [101] her Honour concluded that there is ""no reason why a ... principal Crown witness should be treated any differently in this respect from a person who falls into the category of complainant in a sexual misconduct case"". Importantly, however, her Honour added that in such circumstances a Markuleski direction is not mandated and, even if it were, the failure to give it is not necessarily fatal (Hajje at [101]).

119In our view, it is unnecessary to consider in this case whether a Markuleski direction was required. The trial judge applied a far higher level of scrutiny to AA's evidence than that which was required by a conventional Markuleski direction by giving himself the accomplice warning that has been extracted above at [104]. A direction in accordance with Markuleski would have meant that, if his Honour were to have entertained a reasonable doubt concerning one aspect of AA's evidence, his Honour should have taken that doubt into account in assessing the truthfulness of his evidence generally. It is clear beyond question that his Honour started from the proposition that there was a reason to doubt every aspect of AA's evidence, and that he was only prepared to accept his evidence on critical matters where it was either not in dispute or where it was confirmed or corroborated by other evidence. 

120The Crown submitted that rule 4 applied to this ground, the trial judge having invited submissions from counsel as to the directions by which he should be bound. The appellant's counsel did not submit that a Markuleski direction was required. We accept the Crown's submission. Having regard to the lack of substance in this ground as argued, we would refuse leave to raise it.

Ground 5: Inadequate reasons

121Ground 5 of the appeal contends that the trial judge failed to expose the reasoning that led to a finding of guilt ""adequately or at all"". The appellant's written submissions did not address this ground. The trial judge's reasoning process, in support of the finding of guilt, has in any event been addressed above. Other than the matter addressed and rejected at [107] above, nothing was raised in argument to suggest that his Honour's reasons did not comply with s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act or were otherwise inadequate.

122We reject this ground.

Ground 5A: Conduct of and interventions by the trial judge rendered the trial unfair

123The precise complaint raised by the ground is the following:

""The trial judge excessively intervened in the cross-examination of [AA]. He criticised and disparaged counsel. Counsel was ultimately dismissed and withdrew from the proceedings. The conduct by the judge was such that the appellant lost confidence in his counsel. The conduct of the trial judge was such that the appellant did not appear to receive a fair trial.""

124The written submissions identify what are said to be ""instances"" of the conduct of the trial judge which rendered the trial unfair. Each of those instances is addressed below. The Court was not invited to consider any other exchanges between the trial judge and counsel.

Effect on the trial

125As formulated, this ground of appeal seeks only to invoke the third limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, namely whether ""on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice"". In Lee, Do Young v Regina; Lee, Seong Won v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [34] Basten JA (Hall and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing) summarised the position concerning this ground as follows:

""The words 'on any other ground' have been said not to postulate demonstrable error, but 'simply require that 'something occurred or did not occur' in the trial': TKWJ at [30] (Gaudron J). The internal quotation in that passage comes from the judgment of Doyle CJ in R v Scott (1996) 131 FLR 137 at 152 where, with the agreement of Cox and Matheson JJ, the Chief Justice noted that the third condition was engaged 'where something occurred or did not occur such that the trial became unfair'. Generally, the act or omission will have occurred 'in the trial': TKWJ at [30]. Nevertheless, as Doyle CJ recognised, it is the effect of the act or omission on the trial, rather than the circumstances of its occurrence which is critical. A trial may be rendered unfair by extraneous factors, such as delay in bringing a prosecution - Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 - or the inability of an accused to obtain legal representation: Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; 177 CLR 292."" (emphasis added)

126In circumstances where the event or conduct in question did not of itself constitute a fundamental defect in the trial then, as the emphasised portion of this passage from Lee indicates, it is necessary to consider the effect of the event or conduct on the trial (Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at 622 [24] per Gummow and Hayne JJ, TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46, 212 CLR 124 at [31] and [33] per Gaudron J, [79] per McHugh J, [101] per Gummow J, and [104] per Hayne J, Cesan v R [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 at [112] per Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ).

127Since this was a judge alone trial no question arises as to the possible impact on the jury of the conduct of the trial judge (cf Kho v R [2012] NSWCCA 71 at [45] to [55], and see Cesan v R at [46] per French CJ, [105] per Gummow J, and [119] per Haynes, Crennan and Kiefel JJ). Further, and despite ample opportunity to do so, it was not submitted on behalf of the appellant that the conduct of the trial judge demonstrated actual bias, or gave rise to a reasonable apprehension by a fair minded lay observer that the trial judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the case (Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337). 

128Instead only two ways in which the judge's conduct impacted on the trial process were identified, or at least implied, by this ground of appeal and the appellant's submissions. The first is the dismissal of the first counsel and her withdrawal from the proceedings allegedly because the appellant lost confidence in her. The second was the apprehension on the part of the appellant that his trial was not fair. This latter complaint travels nowhere. A subjective belief on the part of an accused person that they did not receive a fair trial does not amount to a miscarriage of justice. The imputation of such a belief on the part of the hypothetical and reasonable lay observer is a different matter but, as we have emphasised, no allegation of apprehended bias was advanced on the appeal.

129Accepting (without determining) that the first counsel was dismissed because the accused lost confidence in her (and accepting without deciding that a substantial cause for that lack of confidence was the judge's comments during the trial) counsel on the appeal did not seek to explore or outline how that circumstance might have led to a miscarriage of justice. We have already adverted to the possibility that, in other situations, such conduct might give rise to actual bias or an apprehension of bias or otherwise to have so detrimentally impacted upon a jury as to have rendered the trial unfair. However, such possibilities have no application here. It also may be that such conduct could result in a denial of the accused's right to procedural fairness, in that the accused might have been effectively denied the right to have counsel represent their interests, although that would, in part, depend on whether adequate alternative representation were obtained. This consideration also does not arise on the appeal.

130Again, it is unnecessary to explore this further because the contention that the first counsel withdrew because the appellant's lack of confidence in her was engendered by the trial judge's disparagement or criticism of her has not been established on the material before this Court. It was not supported by any affidavit from either the first counsel or the appellant. As further explained below, the material before this Court suggests that the more likely explanation for her dismissal was that it was a tactical decision made by the appellant, conscious of the need to avoid, or at least minimise, the adverse view his Honour might ultimately form from the discrepancy that was about to become apparent between the matters put to AA in cross-examination (and those that were not put), and what the appellant was intending to advance as his case in evidence. 

131The dismissal of the first counsel occurred on the 77th day of the trial. By that time all of the Crown witnesses had been called. On that day his Honour delivered reasons for refusing (another) disqualification application. His Honour then dealt with various objections to parts of the evidence and the tender of exhibits prior to the Crown closing its case. At some point there was a pointed exchange between the trial judge and the first counsel about whether the indictment disclosed latent duplicity.

132Immediately after the resumption following the mid-morning adjournment the first counsel announced that her instructions had been withdrawn but that her solicitor was still instructed. There was then a discussion about whether she required leave to withdraw, in the course of which counsel stated ""I assure your Honour this is not a question of me withdrawing on the basis of any ethical reason, it's simply the fact that my instructions have been withdrawn"".

133The trial judge made an inquiry of the appellant's solicitor. He told his Honour that he had written instructions from his client concerning counsel, a copy of which were handed to his Honour (and marked MFI 92). The document recorded the appellant as having withdrawn his instructions from his counsel and continued:

""The judge has spoken today, and previously to my Counsel like a schoolgirl. It is my belief that the judge does not respect what my counsel says; legally as for other issues in the trial. I hereby instruct [my solicitor] to instruct new Counsel. I believe this will then allow my new counsel a fresh start to complete my trial ie (a) legal arguments; (b) submissions; (c) address and any other issues raised by my new counsel.""

134The Court adjourned for lunch to enable the Crown to consider its position. After the resumption at 2.00pm, the solicitor advised the Court that he had spoken to the Legal Aid Commission, who advised his Honour that:

""Mr Orchard has just signed a document reinstructing [his first counsel], the reason being is that the Commission has given two options that Mr Orchard reinstructs [his first counsel] or he can have a fresh counsel, though no preparation would be paid to that counsel.""

135A further document was produced to the Court recording that the appellant had reinstructed counsel. At this point the first counsel stated that she wished to obtain a ruling from a professional conduct committee before she accepted the brief. His Honour allowed her an adjournment to do so. Later that afternoon she returned to Court and stated:

""Your Honour, I have received advice. Thank you for that time. As your Honour knows, my instructions were withdrawn and I have been asked to re-accept the brief in this matter. However, because of what your Honour has said in the past in relation to my conduct and the fact that there is a real possibility that my conduct may be the subject of criticism by your Honour, there are reasonable grounds to believe that my professional conduct may be attacked in this case and given I no longer hold the brief but rather I am being re-offered the brief, I must refuse it.""

136This statement appears to reflect advice the barrister had received concerning sub-rule 95(f) of the New South Wales Barristers' Rules. This rule obliges a barrister to ""refuse to accept or retain a brief"" in circumstances where ""the barrister has reasonable grounds to believe that the barrister's own personal or professional conduct may be attacked in the case"". While it does not fall to us to review the correctness of the advice, the invocation of sub-rule 95(f) in this case seems curious for two reasons. First, the barrister had previously advised the Court that she was not withdrawing for ""ethical reasons"" (see [132] above). However if sub-rule 95(f) were applicable and prevented her from accepting fresh instructions, it would also have obliged her to return the brief, assuming of course that she was aware of its operation. 

137Second, the assertion that she believed that her professional conduct may be attacked in this case was unparticularised. As we see it, sub-rule 95(f) is not readily able to be invoked simply because it is anticipated that there is or may be tension, even antipathy, between a barrister and a judge. The rule is directed to concerns being raised about the barrister's personal or professional conduct, and seeks to minimise the disruption to proceedings that can occur when the conduct of counsel who is appearing has become (or may become) material to the determination of the proceedings. In some cases it may be difficult, almost impossible, for counsel to continue to appear because, for example, they may become a witness. The course of action suggested by Gleeson CJ in Birks at 683C and noted above at [43], namely counsel returning the brief and giving evidence as to their instructions, is an example of this rule in operation. At this point of the appellant's trial, and as best as we can ascertain, the most likely matter that warranted a belief on counsel's part that her professional conduct would be attacked, are the questions she should have expected would be asked if she continued to appear and elicited evidence from the appellant that, on one view, either directly contradicted the case she had put to AA or, arguably at least, should have been but were not put to AA for his comment.

138Upon being apprised that the first counsel would decline to accept the fresh instructions from the appellant, his Honour adjourned the proceedings to the next day when new counsel appeared. Not surprisingly the second counsel sought an adjournment. The proceedings were adjourned to the following day and then for a further day while new counsel familiarised himself with those aspects of the proceedings that needed to be addressed before the Crown case closed. Argument on those matters resumed on 18 and 21 March 2011 when the Crown case closed. There was then a break of nine days before the appellant's case opened on 30 March 2011. The appellant commenced giving evidence on that day.

139We have already discussed how the appellant's evidence was in significant respects inconsistent with what had been put to AA on his behalf and how the details of his various dealings with AA had not been put to AA for comment. We have also discussed the potential conflict between the appellant and his instructions to counsel that was likely to become obvious had she continued to act for the appellant and adduce evidence from him.

140Ordinarily there is no occasion to inquire into the reasons why counsel may have withdrawn from a trial or, as in this case, declined to (re)accept a brief. However, this ground of appeal invited an inquiry into the impact of the alleged instances of interference by the trial judge on the fairness of the trial, the effect said by the appellant to have caused him to lose confidence in his counsel and ultimately to withdraw his instructions. However, as the records bears out and a matter which was left unexplained, the appellant sought to re-instruct her but she declined to accept for an unparticularised ethical reason. 

141As we have observed, the preponderance of the material relied upon in support of this ground of appeal suggests that the likely reason counsel refused to (re)accept the brief was because the evidence the appellant proposed to give was inconsistent with what had been put on his behalf. In addition there were large parts of his evidence that had not been put to AA at all, with the obvious potential for the Crown Prosecutor to have relied upon those matters to attack the appellant's credibility. Were that to have occurred, the conduct of the first counsel was likely to have been scrutinised, and her ability to continue acting for the appellant being in doubt.

142In any event, in the result the appellant retained alternative counsel who adduced evidence on his behalf and addressed the trial judge in final submissions to ultimate effect given the doubts his Honour entertained as to the sufficiency of critical parts of the Crown case. It follows that this ground of appeal must fail, there being no allegation of apprehended bias on the part of the trial judge, and where no adverse impact on the fairness of the trial has been demonstrated.

143Despite the Court resolving to that view, given the nature of the complaint concerning the trial judge's conduct, the instances of what was said to be the trial judge's misconduct should be addressed.

144The first instance identified by the appellant is said to be an occasion when the trial judge was said to be ""unsympathetic towards the accused regarding his lack of sleep"". This refers to an incident on the 37th day of the trial (26 November 2010) when the trial judge observed that the appellant was unconscious in the dock. His Honour expressed concern for the appellant's health (""is he breathing"") and was advised that the appellant was asleep. His Honour inquired further and was told that the appellant was only returned to his cell at half past one that morning. The appellant explained that another inmate had apparently abused a prison officer and along with the other inmates from his cell he was punished by being returned to his cell late. His Honour stated:

""Well firstly you'd better have a chat to your colleagues about abusing prison officers I guess. I've got no control over disciplinary action at the gaol, but it's undesirable that you be taken back to your cell at 1.30.""

145We are not persuaded that these comments display a lack of ""sympathy"" as alleged. These same comments then formed the basis for an application for the trial judge to disqualify himself because it was said they implied that the judge considered the appellant to be someone with ""considerable power in the prison"". His Honour understandably (and rightly in our view) refused the application. The implication was groundless. 

146The second matter complained of is said to have involved ""trial counsel [taking] issue with the judge over an allegation of inappropriate smiling at the appellant"". The third instance is a related allegation that counsel claimed to be in tears as a result of his Honour's comments. The ""smiling dispute"" began on the 44th day of the trial (8 December 2010). By this time AA was in his 17th day of cross-examination. The trial judge reminded counsel of the need to introduce some element of efficiency into her cross-examination. In the exchange that followed the trial judge took exception to what he described as counsel's habit of responding to questions by ""constantly turn[ing] to [her] client to seek his approval [w]ith a big smile on [her] face, as if [she thought she was] making some point in defiance"". This led to a pantomime style exchange in which counsel denied acting in that way. On 9 December 2010 the first counsel returned to the topic of alleged inappropriate smiling. She denied engaging in conduct of that kind, describing the allegations as ""incredibly offensive and very serious"". 

147The next day of the trial, 10 December 2010, was the last day of the trial in that calendar year. During the course of that day there was a further exchange when the trial judge queried why counsel was returning to a matter concerning the credit of AA on the 19th day of his cross-examination that she had already taken up with AA on the fifth day of his cross-examination. The trial judge insisted that counsel get to the point and continued:

""HIS HONOUR: Because thus far you haven't made a point in relation to the matter. You've got other calls you say you want to play and you smile to yourself. Self-satisfaction obviously in your job, but I'm telling you, you just take time that is far to [sic] long to get to the real issues that you want to address and this is a very good example of it.

[FIRST COUNSEL]: Your Honour I don't know what your Honour is associating with a smile. There have been times here where I have been practically in tears. Your Honour is obviously misrepresenting the facial expressions I am making. I did not just smile in self-satisfaction, I dispute that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Right, well you dispute it. You weren't smiling in self satisfaction. But the point is you must get to the point ...""

148The trial resumed on 1 February 2011. The opening submission of the first counsel was that the trial judge should disqualify himself on the basis of apprehended bias, a matter we reiterate that was not re-agitated before this Court. The submissions concerning that application continued over two days. On the appeal, counsel pointed to one part of the exchange in which the ""smiling matter"" resurfaced. However, we note it was the first counsel who raised it as part of the disqualification application, after which she attempted to link it to another statement made by his Honour as conveying a suggestion by the trial judge of an inappropriate relationship between her and her client. There was nothing in his Honour's comments that warranted that construction. 

149His Honour rejected the application. Ultimately the cross-examination continued to the 54th day of the trial (10 February 2011), being 27 hearing days and almost three months since it commenced.

150The last incident complained of occurred on the 74th day of the trial (10 March 2011) and in part involved a re-agitation of the ""smiling matter"" and otherwise the trial judge expressing his annoyance with counsel generally. It appears to have taken place in the context of an inquiry by the trial judge as to what recordings counsel wanted to play during her cross-examination of a police officer and argument over a motion filed by the accused for the production of further documents by the Crown. The relevant exchange was as follows:

""HIS HONOUR: Yeah it may be but the - we're talking about the Crown case, I'm not talking about what the Crown has proven, I'm not talking about what the evidence has established, do you know the difference between the Crown case as opposed to what is actually established in the evidence?
[FIRST COUNSEL]: Of course I do your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: You do, do you? Well then if you understood that you'd understand precisely what I was saying yesterday.
[FIRST COUNSEL]: Well, your Honour that's another unjustified insult in my respectful opinion.

HIS HONOUR: Well with respect to you, the facts of the matter are you just don't listen to what's said and it's clear to me -
[FIRST COUNSEL]: Well that's your Honour's -

HIS HONOUR: It's clear to me that you don't read what's in the transcript and you can smile to yourself about it but it's just demonstrated time and time and time again.
[FIRST COUNSEL]: And your Honour, with respect, this is my place of work.

HIS HONOUR: Beg your pardon?
[FIRST COUNSEL]: This is my place of work your Honour, your Honour continually -

HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you and I expect you to act professionally and to say things that represent what is in fact the case -
[FIRST COUNSEL]: And your Honour -

HIS HONOUR: - not to make some allegations against me as you did just this morning which don't represent what the transcript reveals -
[FIRST COUNSEL]: Well your Honour I -

HIS HONOUR: - and that's why I've specifically gone to the transcript.
[FIRST COUNSEL]: I should be allowed to come into my place of work without being embarrassed, humiliated and insulted throughout the course of the day with respect.

HIS HONOUR: You're not being embarrassed, humiliated or insulted, you're just being brought to account for the things that you've said on occasions which are untrue and I think I've got an obligation to do that.
[FIRST COUNSEL]: Well respectfully -

HIS HONOUR: And with respect to you, on a number of occasions I've brought to your attention where you have been in error and I have not received one apology in relation to material matters, that's the fact of the matter.
[FIRST COUNSEL]: As the Court pleases.""

151There is no doubt that, by the time of this exchange, relations between counsel and the Bench were extremely strained. However, tension between a Judge and counsel, whatever the cause, does not of itself render the trial unfair. Critically, this being in a trial without a jury the appellant has failed to identify what is said to be the impact of the exchange on the trial's fairness. This Court has no independent function to police judicial manners or enforce standards by which counsel are expected to behave in their exchanges with the presiding judicial officer. A consideration of such matters can only occur as part of the exercise of the Court's function to determine whether there was a miscarriage of justice. It was incumbent on the appellant to establish that the strained relations between his Honour and counsel so undermined the right of the accused to a fair trial that a miscarriage of justice resulted, yet he did not do so. 

152At the risk of repetition, there is no submission that these exchanges demonstrated that the trial judge was biased, or that a reasonable observer might apprehend bias. Neither are we satisfied that these exchanges motivated the appellant to withdraw his instructions. Again, at the risk of repetition, in the result, the appellant was represented by alternative counsel about whom there is no complaint. In a different context, for example of a jury trial, a display of antipathy between a trial judge and counsel for the accused might lead to a miscarriage of justice. Even in that context, some connection between that antipathy and an unfair trial needs to be identified and demonstrated. In this case, the only suggested effects of these exchanges were not established. They do not indicate that the trial was unfair.

Failure to transcribe material

153The appellant's written submissions included a separate complaint under this ground to the effect that the trial was ""unfair and unmanageable as a result of the prosecution not transcribing intercepted telephone calls on telephones used by 'AA' and 'BB'"". This appears to be a reference to the telephone calls between AA, BB and persons other than the appellant or Paxton who it was suggested that AA may have sold drugs to or obtained finance from for the transactions with Paxton. (A further contention that this Court could not properly review the evidence at the trial without listening to each call that was played during the trial was withdrawn.)

154This complaint bears no relationship to the fifth ground of appeal. It also has no substance. Recordings of the calls were made available to the appellant and they were played to AA and BB during their cross-examination. As stated, the defence tendered an exhibit which contained a chronological list of all of the telephone calls (and messages) that it relied on. This exhibit included a summary of what was said that included verbatim extracts. Otherwise there is nothing to suggest that a request was made of the prosecution to transcribe any calls in advance of the trial.

Conclusion on ground 5A

155As formulated, ground 5A of the appeal involves a mixed question of fact and law such that leave is required under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Given the lack of any substance in the ground as argued, leave to appeal is refused.

Ground 4: Verdict of the trial judge unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence

156Ground 4 of the appeal contends that the jury's verdict of guilty was ""unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence"" (Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(1)). In raising this ground the appellant implicitly seeks a grant of leave under s 5(1)(b) as this ground involves questions of fact or questions of mixed law and fact (Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12]). Leave is granted.

157The wording of this ground of appeal substantially derives from a passage in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487. The High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ), at 493, said:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.""

Then, at 494-5, the High Court said:
""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the Court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.""

158The term ""open to the jury"" in the foregoing passage ought not distract this Court from the need to examine whether, as a matter of law, there is evidence to establish each element of the offence, directly or by inference, but whether the jury ought to have experienced a reasonable doubt: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; (2010) 242 CLR 491; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400.

159Unlike trials before a jury, when this Court hears an appeal from a judge sitting alone it has the benefit of the trial judge's reasons. That said, what the Court is concerned with is the evidence before the trial judge rather than the contents of their reasons. Thus in Fleming at [26] the High Court stated: 

""Thirdly, the first limb of s.6(1), which deals with the unsatisfactory quality of 'the verdict of the jury', must now be seen through the prism of s.33(1). The first limb will address attention to the evidence upon which the trial judge acted, or upon which it was open to the trial judge to act, in reaching the finding as to ultimate guilt. Approached on that footing, is that finding 'unreasonable' or one which 'cannot be supported'?"" (emphasis added)

160Three further points should be noted. First, the trial judge's reasons will ordinarily include, or should include, such findings as have been made in relation to the credibility of the witnesses at the trial. These findings will have often been informed by the advantages the trial judge enjoyed in making that assessment by observing the witnesses give their evidence. The role these advantages play in the exercise of this Court's function when considering whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence was explained in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [13] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ (citing M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 494):

""The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M v The Queen [at 494] went on to say: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.'""

161In Lee at [207] Basten JA (Hall and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing) noted that the passage from M v R approved in SKA suggested that ""only in a minority of cases will the jury obtain a significant advantage from seeing and hearing the evidence"". Nevertheless some allowance for the same advantage enjoyed by a judge sitting without a jury is warranted, at least in cases where the reasons of the trial judge reveal that it has been deployed. 

162Secondly, it may be that in a particular case the reasoning of the trial judge is sufficiently persuasive that it provides this Court with assistance in forming a conclusion that the verdict was not unreasonable or unsupported having regard to the evidence. Thus in Fleming at [44] to [46] the High Court did not discern any error of approach by this Court in examining the ""the evidence and the reasoning of the trial judge"" in that case. Nevertheless the task imposed by this ground of appeal requires the Court to undertake its own ""independent assessment of the evidence both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" (Morris v R [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473) and then to consider the evidence presented by the Crown and weigh the conflicting evidence (SKA v R at [24] per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ). 

163Thirdly, in Lee [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [210], Basten JA (Hall and Beech-Jones JJ agreeing) commented on the role of counsel on appeal and stressed the need to identify the particular aspects of the verdict (""the complaints"") that were unsafe and the alleged basis for doubt. In an appeal from a judge alone trial, these comments are even more apposite.

164The appellant's written submissions did not identify his ""complaints"" with any clarity. Instead the submissions simply identified the grounds of the appeal at the outset and then addressed various aspects of the evidence with the occasional criticism of the trial judge's reasons referable to that evidence. There was no attempt to identify any particular matter that warranted the characterisation of the trial judge's verdict as unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence. As best as can be ascertained the matters said by the appellant to warrant that characterisation are those that have already been addressed, namely the absence of material corroborative of AA's evidence, AA's own drug dealing, the alleged lies and inconsistencies in AA's evidence, similar difficulties with BB's evidence, and surveillance material that was said to at least raise a reasonable possibility that persons other than the appellant financed the various drug purchases. Despite the lack of assistance, we have undertaken the task of assessing the sufficiency and quality of all of the evidence independently in order to determine whether doubt exists.

165The starting point in this case is the identification of the ""verdict"" that is said to be unsupportable. The appellant was found guilty of a charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, namely 250 grams. It follows that this ground of appeal will fail if it were open to his Honour to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant supplied at least that amount. It follows that, if it were open to his Honour to have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant financed the purchase of the 413 grams of methylamphetamine that was found at AA's premises on 9 May 2008, then this ground of appeal must fail.

166The evidence concerning that 413 grams included the evidence of AA which directly identified the appellant as the financier of that purchase. The various criticisms of AA's general credibility and the inconsistencies in his versions of events pointed to by the appellant are well enough founded and obvious. Although the inconsistencies between BB's evidence and that of AA in relation to receiving the funds on the evening of 8 May 2008 warrants the exercise of considerable caution before accepting her account as does her generally poor character, BB's evidence provided some support for AA's evidence. Of particular significance, the evidence connecting the appellant to the cash that was found at the house in Tudor Street was, in our view, overwhelming. It supported the conclusion that the appellant had the means to finance the purchase of 413 grams of methylamphetamine. In addition, the manner in which the cash kept at Tudor Street was bundled is consistent with AA's description of the cash he collected from the appellant at his home on the evening of 8 May 2008.

167As we see it, however, the most significant evidence confirming the accuracy and reliability of AA's evidence that the appellant financed the purchase of the 413 grams found at his house on 9 May 2008 was the surveillance evidence that has been set out at length at [54] to [100] above. In our view, that evidence overwhelmingly pointed to the appellant, and excluded AA and others, as the financier of the purchase. Critically, when considered in context, the fact that AA immediately departed for Sydney to complete the purchase from Paxton after meeting the appellant on the evening of 8 May 2008 provides very considerable support for AA's version of the amount of cash he received from appellant to purchase methylamphetamine at that time. For the sake of completeness, we record that a consideration of the surveillance material for the first five transactions does not undermine our assessment of its significance in proof of the sixth transaction. To the contrary, we regard it as consistent with it.

168The appellant denied that he financed the sixth transaction and the trial judge rejected his evidence. His Honour enjoyed an advantage over this Court in making that assessment, an advantage that was deployed (see [34] above) and is of relevance to the disposition of this ground of appeal (see [160] above). Leaving that advantage aside, the appellant's evidence was inconsistent with the surveillance evidence. It was open to a trier of fact, acting reasonably, to reject the appellant's evidence by reference to it. 

169Our assessment of the evidence leads us to conclude that there is no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant and it was open to the trial judge to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt of the charge of which he was convicted.

170This ground is rejected.

Conclusion on conviction appeal

171Leave to raise grounds 3 and 5A is refused. Leave to raise ground 4 is granted, but the ground is rejected. The remaining grounds are rejected and the appeal against the conviction is dismissed.

Sentence appeal

172Mr Orchard relies on three grounds of appeal against sentence, although the written submissions lodged on his behalf only appear to address two of them. Before considering those grounds, it is necessary to briefly summarise the relevant findings of his Honour on sentence. Nevertheless, it is convenient to reiterate that grounds 6, 7 and 8, recited above, are relevant to the appeal on sentence.

Facts and Remarks

173First, as stated there was an agreed basis before his Honour as to the quantity of drugs that the appellant was found to have supplied, namely ""approximately 612 to 620"" grams of methylamphetamine. His Honour also stated that he was satisfied that AA had provided methylamphetamine to the appellant on other occasions, but the precise quantities purchased could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

174Second, his Honour made a number of further findings placing the supply in context. In particular his Honour found that the offence had been committed by the appellant ""as a business run by him to a network of regular clients"" with many of those clients purchasing drugs for the purpose of on-supply to others as well for their own personal use. His Honour described this business as involving the sourcing of methylamphetamine, not only from AA but from other unknown persons. His Honour stated:

""I was required to listen to many hundreds of telephone intercepts and other recordings of private conversations involving the prisoner where the prisoner was clearly directing his drug supply operation with singular purpose and what he believed to be singular cunning. As the case proceeded, sometimes shadowing the events of 2008 in real time, a disturbing picture emerged of a man prepared to use his friends, his children, his parents-in-law and others for his own purposes; a person who clearly was not prepared to brook any interference and quite prepared when his interests were threatened to foreshadow significant violence as I discussed in the judgment. He was locally known as 'Brother' an expression I am quite satisfied that reflected, at least amongst the drug using and other criminal milieu of the Belmont and nearby areas, considerable respect.""

175Third, his Honour addressed the appellant's personal and family circumstances. His Honour noted that at the time he committed the offence the appellant was aged fifty. He was fifty-four at the time of sentencing. His parents were still alive and he had an older brother and young sister. He had four children. His two sons were aged twenty-seven and eighteen respectively at the time of sentencing. One of his sons had a serious mental illness. His two daughters were aged twenty-three and sixteen. Their mother died in May 2007. She had been addicted to heroin. His Honour accepted that the appellant was concerned about the welfare of his children and noted that there was ""much to be concerned about"". His Honour also stated that, knowing their difficulties, he ""continued with his lawless lifestyle"" and had involved his daughter in his ""drug supply activities"".

176The appellant had left school at the age of fifteen. His Honour noted that his criminal history, which we will describe, suggested that he had been committed to a juvenile justice institution some time before his fourteenth birthday. His Honour recorded the appellant telling a psychiatrist that he had used drugs since his teenage years and had become addicted to heroin at the age of seventeen. His Honour accepted that history.

177His Honour noted that at some point the appellant and his deceased wife had opened up a bakery in Cessnock which had two retail outlets and appeared to be successful. Ultimately it failed. The appellant claimed that this was principally due to his wife and sister-in-law taking money from the business to feed their drug habit, although his Honour did not consider it necessary to resolve the truth of that assertion. Since that time the appellant had supported himself by welfare benefits (and presumably the proceeds of drug dealing).

178Fourth, his Honour addressed the appellant's criminal history. His Honour noted that there was an absence of ""significant convictions for drug supply"", but concluded that this did not ""entitle him to any particular leniency"" and that the instances of non-custodial sentences being imposed revealed that the appellant had ""plenty of 'chances'"". A review of that record reveals that from when he was fourteen the appellant has been convicted of various small scale offences of dishonesty, common assaults and possession of offensive weapons, driving offences and possession of prohibited drugs. Prior to this matter, he has only served one previous custodial sentence in 1977 for possession of heroin.

179Fifth, his Honour dealt at some length with various reports that were put before him indicating that the appellant suffered from a mental illness. These reports and his Honour's treatment of them are addressed further below in relation to ground 7. For present purposes it need only be noted that his Honour appeared to accept that he had suffered from a significant psychiatric illness.

180Sixth, his Honour noted that the appellant was arrested on 9 May 2008 and had been in custody since that date. Accordingly, his Honour considered that any sentence should date from that time. His Honour also considered the delay between the time that he was arrested and the time at which he was sentenced. His Honour concluded that it could be taken in to account but only ""to a limited extent"" and that it was ""not a significant issue in the sentencing exercise"". There is no challenge to that aspect of his Honour's reasoning.

181Seventh, his Honour considered questions of parity between the position of the offender and the sentences imposed on AA. AA had pleaded guilty to two charges of supply. The first charge alleged that between 1 February 2008 and 10 May 2008 he supplied not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The second charge alleged that on 9 May 2008 he supplied cannabis. After allowing for a discount for his plea and his offer of assistance, which manifested itself in him giving evidence at the appellant's trial, AA received a head sentence of seven years on the first charge with a non-parole period of four years. On the second charge he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years which was concurrent with the sentence for the first charge.

182His Honour noted a number of differentiating factors between the appellant and AA, including the appellant's dominant role, and the absence of a number of mitigating factors that were relevant to AA, such as remorse, contrition and prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also noted that the conviction of the appellant following a trial gave rise to a need for a ""direct consideration"" of the standard non-parole period in the appellant's case (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act"") Part 4, Division 1A. The appellant does not take any issue with his Honour's consideration of parity between him and AA although he does challenge the manner in which his Honour had regard to the standard non-parole period.

183Eighth, his Honour addressed the relevance of the prescription of a standard non-parole period for this offence of ten years in accordance with Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act. His Honour also stated:

""This brings me to Pt 4 Div 1A of the [Sentencing Act]. This is directly relevant here because the prisoner has been sentenced for an offence carrying a standard non-parole period after trial. I am required to ask myself the question are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period? I am required to have regard to that question, noting the objective seriousness of the offence considered in the light of the facts which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it is committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls within the mid-range of seriousness of an offence of a relevant kind and also the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation which are present in the subject case (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 ...).""

184Consistent with this approach, his Honour concluded that the appellant's offence was ""one of greater seriousness than an offence in the middle range of seriousness"" and that it was ""substantially above the mid-range, although it is not the worst offence committed by the worst offender"". His Honour described it as a ""very serious offence of its type concerned with multiple deliberate and well planned acts by the prisoner, designed to maintain his business of the supply of drugs to others for profit for his own financial need and greed"".

185Ground 6 contends that, in light of the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, this aspect of the sentencing process involved error.

186Ninth, his Honour identified the relevant mitigating and aggravating circumstances having regard to s 21A of the Sentencing Act, while noting that the Court was not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in circumstances where it was an element of the offence (s 21A(2)). His Honour placed no additional weight on the fact that the offence had a planned character or that the appellant's clients were vulnerable considering that they were necessary aspects of the offence of which he was convicted. In relation to mitigating factors, his Honour identified the appellant's age, his relationship with his children, his medical conditions and its effect on him in custody and ""some aspects of [the] delay"" he had experienced.

187Tenth, his Honour noted that there were three offences on a Form 1 that the appellant had asked him to consider, namely two charges of possessing methylamphetamine and one of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, being the cash found on 9 May 2008. His Honour noted the requirement to deal with those offences in accordance with Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. His Honour found that this was ""not a case where matters on a Form 1 may have significant salience in sentencing"".

188Eleventh, his Honour made a finding of ""special circumstances"" for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act because of the appellant's need for ""mental health and drug dependency treatment and counselling"", and for professional assistance to ""adjust to community living after an extended period of custody"".

Ground 6: Error in approach to the standard non parole period

189Ground 6 contends that his Honour erred in sentencing the appellant by applying the standard non-parole period in the manner advanced in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 (and not in accordance with Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120). 

190Muldrock was decided after his Honour sentenced the appellant. Accordingly, at the time of the sentencing hearing his Honour was bound to apply Division 1A in accordance with the decision of this Court in Way. The passage that is extracted above at [183] above reflects the approach propounded in Way. However, in Muldrock the High Court found, inter alia, that the analysis of Division 1A in Way was wrong:

""[25] ... It follows from that acceptance that Way was wrongly decided. As will appear, it was an error to characterise s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms. The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness.

...

[28] Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.

191Thus the appellant contends that his Honour committed the same error that this Court was found in Muldrock to have wrongly sanctioned in Way. The Crown conceded that this error was established, but submitted that this Court should conclude that no lesser sentence was warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3)). The Crown's concession was well founded. We address the balance of its submission below.

Ground 7: Alleged failure to take into account or give sufficient weight to the ""appellant's mental health issues and other health issues""

192Ground 7 contends that his Honour ""failed to take into account, or give sufficient weight to, the appellant's mental health issues and other health issues"". We have already noted briefly his Honour's consideration of the medical evidence concerning the appellant. In fact, his Honour addressed the medical evidence in great detail. His consideration of the material and its relevance to sentencing occupies over seventeen pages of the sentencing judgment. In those circumstances the suggestion that that his Honour failed to take into account these matters is not only entirely without substance, it is a submission that should not have been made.

193The contention that his Honour failed to give ""sufficient weight"" to the appellant's mental health and other medical issues does not of itself raise any matter justifying intervention by this Court (Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37 at [24] per French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ, and at [53] per Gageler J). However, it may be called in aid of an argument that the sentence was too severe (or manifestly inadequate) (Bugmy at [53]). As that contention is raised as part of ground 8 and as it will be necessary to address the Crown's submission that no lesser sentence is warranted we will address it at this point.

194The substance of the complaint is that his Honour erred in some way in his consideration of the evidence concerning the appellant's schizophrenia. Tendered before his Honour was a report from a psychiatrist, Dr White, dated 1 February 1999 which had apparently been prepared in relation to some proceedings concerning either the custody or welfare of his children. Also tendered was a report from a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, dated 1 August 2011, and the appellant's general practitioner, Dr Outridge, dated 4 August 2011. 

195In his report Dr White concluded that:

""I can say with reasonable medical certainty that Mr Orchard suffers from Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia with delusions that he and members of his family suffer from a fungus infection which comes from gum trees but he himself believes that he contracted it by injecting himself with Methadone mixed with water which was infected by aquatic worm which had a member of the Protoza family in its gullet.""

196His Honour noted that Dr White's report was ""careful to isolate the extent of the delusional thinking"" to fungus and worms.

197Mr Watson-Munro's report stated, inter alia:

""I note from the extensive documentation that [the appellant] has been diagnosed with Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia as far back as 1 February 1999 and that he has been essentially a non-compliant patient in terms of recommended treatments since then. My own assessment failed to reveal any signs of psychosis at both times of examination, although appropriate psychometric testing confirms high levels of depression, anxiety and low self esteem.""

198His Honour noted that Mr Watson-Munro stated that the appellant gave a ""reasonable, coherent account of himself"" and denied experiencing ""any delusions of reference or hallucinations in recent times"". 

199Dr Outridge stated that he was the appellant's ""GP and methadone prescriber between 2001 and May 2008"". He stated that the appellant's medical conditions were chronic opioid dependence, chronic amphetamine dependence, chronic psychotic disorder, antisocial personality and hepatitis B and C.

200Ultimately his Honour's finding was expressed in the following passage:

""I accept that there is evidence that the prisoner had suffered from delusions about his serious skin condition and that a psychiatrist in 1999 diagnosed this as a symptom of chronic paranoid schizophrenia. However, as I have said both in that report and in the commentary of Mr Watson-Munro, there is no evidence of other delusional thinking that affects his day to day functioning and his capacity to reason or anything of the like.""

201His Honour then identified the various ways that this evidence was relevant to the sentencing process. Thus his Honour noted that incarceration may be harder for a prisoner with a medical condition. As noted, his Honour later gave some weight to this factor, although his Honour was not satisfied that the appellant could not receive adequate treatment in custody.

202Critically his Honour noted and addressed a submission that relied on R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 and contended that the appellant's mental illness meant that ""lesser weight should be given to general deterrence because the prisoner was at the time of the commission of the offence suffering from a 'mental abnormality' or 'disability'"". His Honour's response is encompassed by the two findings recorded at [196] and [200], namely that medical evidence was that the appellant's delusional thinking was isolated (to fungus and worms) and that otherwise his mental illness did not affect or induce his offending behaviour (other than perhaps give rise to some anxiety). His Honour stated that there was ""absolutely nothing in the many many calls that I listened to ... that suggests that the [appellant's] planning and scheming and drug dealing over three months was delusional, driven by delusion or impacted upon by his mental illness directly"". His Honour concluded that the appellant's conduct was ""methodical"", ""practical"", ""calculat[ed]"" and undertaken with a full appreciation of ""what he was doing"". 

203These findings meant that the position so far as the appellant was concerned was addressed by the observations of Sperling J in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] to [36]. His Honour referred to Hemsley and stated:

""[W]hilst there could be an indirect relationship between his mental illness, as it might be described, and the offending, it could not in any way be categorised as contributing to the commission of the offence 'in a material way'. Clearly the condition does not reduce the prisoner's moral culpability given the various aspects of the matter I have referred to, including the calculated way in which the prisoner committed the relevant offence and the period of time over which it was committed. This is not an offence committed fleetingly, but over many days.

Neither the character of the mental illness nor its relationship with the offending renders the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, or moderates that consideration. And even if it could be argued that it could be moderated in some way, in this case the prisoner's mental illness, if it could explain in part his offending behaviour left untreated as the prisoner allowed it to be, increases the level of 'danger' in the general sense which the prisoner presents to the community. Particularly as one must acknowledge the danger of the use of methylamphetamine presents to the wider community, both users and those who have to deal with them. Of course ironically the prisoner argues he is such a person."" (emphasis added)

204Save for one possible matter, the written submissions of the appellant about this aspect of the sentencing judgment make no attempt to engage with his Honour's findings or reasoning. Instead they merely restate what he contends was the effect of the medical evidence before his Honour and how it should affect the sentencing discretion. The one possible matter of exception is that some of the submissions appear to challenge his Honour's finding(s) about the lack of connection between his mental illness and offending. We will put to one aside that this ground of appeal is not framed as a challenge to any finding of fact on sentence. Otherwise, the submissions did not even attempt to address the principles respecting such a challenge (R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557 at [61] per Wood CJ at CL, Tobias JA and Hidden J agreeing). 

205Thus it was contended that his mental illness meant that he ""became enmeshed in the drug world as a 'user dealer', unable to live an ordinary working life"" and this established a causal connection between his mental illness and the offence. While the material before his Honour suggested that people with schizophrenia are prone to use drugs, this flourish attempts to blur the distinction between those who use drugs and his Honour's findings about what type of dealer the appellant was found to be. He was not the Jean Valjean of the ice trade, driven to that position by fate and circumstance. He was a powerful, calculating and significant dealer who dominated those around him.

206The appellant's written submissions also refer to parts of the surveillance evidence in which AA referred to the appellant as ""paranoid"" and his ""paranoia"" about police surveillance as somehow suggesting a causal connection between his mental illness and offending. Notwithstanding the length of the time that AA occupied the witness box, one matter that was not explored with him was his qualification to make psychiatric assessments of his associates in the drug trade. In any event a drug dealer such as AA who expresses concern about being the subject of police surveillance, especially when they are, is not being ""paranoid"" in the relevant sense, only sensible. The same submission was made to his Honour who described the appellant's beliefs about surveillance as proper concerns derived from his need for ""self preservation and his [own] interests"".

207All of his Honour's findings of fact on this topic were open to him. There is no basis for concluding that his Honour misdirected himself in making them (Merritt at [61]). We reject ground 7. 

Ground 8: Sentence too severe and whether lesser sentence warranted in law

208Ground 8 of the appeal complains that the sentence imposed was ""too severe"", which we take to be an assertion that it was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).

209The appellant's written submissions did not address this ground at all. As noted, the complaint made in ground 7 that his Honour did not attribute sufficient weight to his mental illness is capable of informing this ground. That matter has already been addressed.

210In addressing this ground and its own submission that, irrespective of the error disclosed by ground 6, no lesser sentence in law was warranted, the Crown pointed to the passage from the sentencing judgment extracted above at [174] above.

211The analysis of the relative seriousness of the appellant's offending by reference to the ""middle of the range of objective seriousness"" for offences under s 25(2) of the DMTA is no longer necessary, or perhaps even appropriate, after Muldrock. Nevertheless the findings made by his Honour still warrant the characterisation of this offence as a very serious example of supplying more than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The two guideposts for the offence are the maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment (Muldrock at [27]). The appellant engaged in supplying the drug over a sustained period and did so to facilitate his retail supply business. The manner in which he exercised control over his contacts and utilised his family is exposed by his Honour's findings. Although much was put forward on his behalf during sentencing, his Honour's findings and analysis reveal that the appellant's subjective circumstances were not particularly compelling and there was no basis for giving any lesser weight to either general or specific deterrence. To the contrary, this case was an appropriate case for the full application of both sentencing principles.

212We are not persuaded that the sentence was manifestly excessive. To the contrary, we are satisfied that no lesser sentence was warranted in law (s 6(3)). Accordingly we reject ground 8. 

213We grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal.

214This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider a psychiatrist's report from Dr Richard Furst dated 2 March 2013 tendered on behalf of the appellant on the ""usual basis"".

215Accordingly the orders of the Court are:

(1)Leave to raise ground 4 of the conviction appeal granted.

(2)Leave to raise grounds 3 and 5A of the conviction appeal refused.

(3)The appeal against the appellant's conviction on 12 August 2011 dismissed.

(4)Leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 12 August 2011 granted; and

(5)The appeal against the sentence imposed on 12 August 2011 dismissed.

2763170,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 16,"Ex TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Mr Pullinger of counsel for Michelle Proud has foreshadowed an objection to certain evidence upon which the Crown proposes to rely. The point has not yet arrived when the tender of that material is imminent. However, the Crown is shortly to open the case to the jury and has fairly indicated an intention to rely upon certain paragraphs in the Crown case statement in the course of that opening. A number of these paragraphs draw upon the material to which the foreshadowed objection will be taken. I am asked at this early stage in the proceedings to determine whether the impugned paragraphs in the Crown case statement should be rejected. The application is made under ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.

2The paragraphs that are the subject of concern are as follows:

""49. A day or so later Ms Hull spoke with PROUD, who said, 'I was going to do a grocery shop and was waiting for Wendy to put money into her account' The witness said, 'What a couple of hundred dollars' PROUD said, 'No a couple of thousand'. 

50. A day or two later, PROUD was very distressed and said to Hull, 'Wendy had not paid the money that she owes us and BJ and I are going to bash the shit out of her if she does not pay in the next day or so'.

52. Telephone intercept material revealed that PROUD contacted EVANS numerous times enquiring about the money that was owed. PROUD left voice and text messages for EVANS. These messages include: 'Hey, Wendy, whats going on, its Michelle, I need that money. Today', 'BJ's going to Berry tonight. He's going to drop into Brad's. He's got a job to do. Um, either have the money in the tab account by seven or he'll be around at Brad's house'; and: 'I want my fucking money bitch and this is Michelle. Where is my fucking money? I'll come down and I'll hunt you down. I know where Brad lives so don't fucking stuff me around. I'm nearly kicked out of my fucking house'. 

53. On Saturday 5 November 2011 at 5:53pm EVANS sent a text message to PROUD and SPICER. EVANS wrote in the message, 'Dad put it in at dimond beach rec 495 000 143 478 929 903 $50'. 

61. At 3:34pm PROUD contacted EVANS on her mobile phone. They discussed how the TAB was investigating transactions relating to the account. PROUD said, 'Apparently she's in trouble for TAB account, 'cause large amounts of monies have gone in from Wollongong to here'. EVANS said 'I've just whacked $350 in now'. SPICER can be heard in the background. 'Oh my God - I hope on ... you know ... on the other end, nothing's gone wrong'. EVANS replied 'No, it's all sweet down here'. PROUD said, 'Yeah'. EVANS said, 'Apparently they're just doing their final parts of the investigation now'. At 4:00pm, the $350 was withdrawn from the TAB account by SPICER's sister. 

63. At 9:54pm on 14 December 2011, PROUD and SPICER engaged in a telephone call. SPICER said, 'What's going on with that other putrid dog?' PROUD said, 'Who?' SPICER said, 'Wendy'. PROUD said, 'I don't know; I'll have to try calling her'. SPICER said, 'I have'. PROUD said, 'Have ya? I called her last week and left a message'. SPICER said, 'She still owes me 600 fuckin' dollars. (pause) ...[something about working] ... [hope] she's locked up. If I knew where that cunt's house was exactly, I'd go around there'.""

3The burden of Mr Pullinger's objections is that the paragraphs concerned convey an impression, which Ms Proud denies, that she is demanding money as payment in return for her involvement in organising or participating in the events that led up to or caused the death of the deceased. His concern is that there is little or no evidence of any other sort that implicates Ms Proud in the death of the deceased so that her arguably vociferous demands for money could, in the particular factual context of this case, be unfairly misconstrued by the jury as evidence of her guilt.

4Mr Pullinger contends that there is no evidence that Ms Proud was consciously aware, in advance of the death of the deceased, that others had planned to set fire to her house, or had arranged to acquire the paraphernalia, including petrol, a cigarette lighter, a bucket and fire starters, to assist them in their plan. He is concerned that the evidence in question, if admitted, may potentially and inappropriately lead a jury retrospectively to reason that her latter-day conversations about money that came to light after the death of the deceased are connected with an assumed, but not proved, involvement with that event. He reasons that there will be prejudice to Ms Proud in the circumstances that is relevantly unfair if, or as, her involvement in the death of the deceased cannot otherwise be clearly established or reasonably inferred.

5Sections 135 and 137 of the Act are as follows:

""135 General discretion to exclude evidence 

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 

(b) be misleading or confusing, or 

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time. 

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

6As I have indicated, this trial is at an early stage. The Crown has not opened its case to the jury and quite obviously no evidence has been called. To that extent there is some uncertainty about precisely what evidence will be ultimately tendered and admitted. Correspondingly, the context within which to determine this application is to a like extent somewhat uncertain.

7Doing the best I can it seems to me that other material, that for present purposes I am prepared to accept will be likely to become evidence in the proceedings, arguably implicates Ms Proud in the events that led to the death of the deceased, quite apart from the material to which objection is taken. It is unnecessary for present purposes to elaborate upon that material or to express a view about its probative value. I am satisfied, however, that the material to which Ms Proud takes objection is not the only material that is likely to become evidence in the case against her. In that sense the material objected to does not sit alone as potential evidence that the jury could unfairly misunderstand or misconstrue to the relevant prejudice of Ms Proud. As presently advised it appears to me to be evidence that a jury might ordinarily be expected to receive and assess in the context of the trial as a whole. It does not amount to material that is bereft of context so that an irremediable unfairness infects it from the start. I accept that the material is potentially inimical, and therefore prejudicial, to Ms Proud's interests in these proceedings, but not unfairly so. I am not presently satisfied that the probative value of the evidence flagged in the paragraphs in the Crown case statement to which objection is taken is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Ms Proud.

8I am therefore not prepared to restrict or to constrain the Crown in opening to the jury upon the paragraphs of the Crown case statement referred to earlier in these reasons. I make no comment upon the question of whether or not at some later point in the trial Ms Proud may have available to her a viable application to oppose the tender of some or any of the evidence upon which the paragraphs in question are based.

2763187,Michael v R [2014] NSWCCA 2,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
The applicant was charged with one count of doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice, contrary to s319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was tried before her Honour Judge Payne and a jury in the District Court at Parramatta. The trial commenced on 21 August 2012 and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on 29 August 2012. On 21 March 2013 Judge Payne sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months, with a balance of term of 1 year.

2The applicant seeks leave to appeal against conviction on a single ground:

Ground 1 - The verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

3The applicant commenced serving his sentence on 21 March 2013. On 26 June 2013 he was granted bail by Slattery J and continues on bail. He has served 3 months and 6 days of the sentence imposed by Judge Payne. The applicant has also appealed against sentence.

The Crown case

4The Crown case was that during the investigation of Mr Salim for two offences, arising out of an incident on 27 August 2010, the Police wanted to question Mr Phillips about the incident as his car was involved. Mr Phillips spoke to the applicant on a few occasions. He told the applicant that he was driving his car at the time of the alleged incident.

5The Crown alleged that the applicant told Mr Phillips to tell the Police that he could not remember who was driving the car on 27 August 2010 and that many people drove the car. The ""course of justice"" was particularised as the prosecution of Mr Salim for the offences that allegedly occurred on 27 August 2010. The Crown case was that the applicant knew this statement to be false and that the advice was given for the purpose of perverting the course of justice, namely the prosecution of Mr Salim. The charges against Mr Salim were subsequently withdrawn due to the exculpatory nature of the statement made by Mr Phillips.

The defence case

6The defence case was that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt because of the inconsistencies in the evidence called on behalf of the Crown. It was submitted that there was no evidence from which to infer an intention by the applicant to defeat or obstruct the prosecution of Mr Salim. The defence submitted that the Crown case did not ""make sense"" because the police already knew who was driving the car and who the passengers were.

7The defence submitted that the only meetings that the applicant had with Mr Phillips were in the presence of the barrister, John Parnell. The defence submitted that there was confusion in the minds of both Mr Phillips and his mother, Dale Phillips, so that they had misconstrued what had happened as they were so concerned about the possible consequences for Mr Phillips, particularly as to why he had not come forward.

Evidence at trial

8The Crown called three witnesses in support of its case: Detective Senior Constable Whale, Mr Phillips and his mother, Dale Phillips. Detective Whale of Quakers Hill Police Station was the officer in charge of the investigation. He said that on 28 August 2010 he arrested and charged Mr Marwan Salim with ""take and detain for advantage"" and with ""demand property with menaces"" in relation to an incident that occurred the previous day. The alleged victim was Mr Robert Rad who described being conveyed in a vehicle which was later identified as belonging to Mr Daniel Phillips. Detective Whale spoke to the applicant (whom he believed to be Mr Salim's solicitor) on the telephone after Mr Salim was arrested. Mr Salim was later granted bail and the investigation continued.

9Detective Whale spoke to Mr Phillips on 17 January 2011 and arranged for him to attend the Quakers Hill Police Station on 19 January. On 19 January 2011 Mr Phillips attended the Quakers Hill Police Station, accompanied by a number of people including a person called ""John"". John advised Detective Whale that Mr Phillips did not wish to speak to him. Mr Phillips and his companions then left the police station.

10Detective Whale's next contact with Mr Phillips was by telephone, possibly a week later. Detective Whale asked Mr Phillips to attend the police station to answer questions in relation to the ownership and who was driving his motor vehicle on 27 August 2010. Detective Whale advised Mr Phillips that he was required by law to answer these questions. Arrangements were made for Mr Phillips to attend the police station on 28 January.

11On that date Detective Whale received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as the applicant. He advised Detective Whale that he and his client would not be able to come to see him that day because he [the applicant] was double booked. Detective Whale was advised that Mr Phillips would attend the police station on 31 January.

12On 31 January 2011 Mr Phillips attended the police station with his mother and spoke to Detective Whale. Detective Whale's evidence was:

""Q. What was the topic of conversation?
A. I told him again that I was going to ask him questions that he would be required to answer about his motor vehicle and I gave him what is called a form of demand that I read to him and when I'd ask the question ""Who is the owner of your motor car?"" he looked at his hand on which he had the words either ""no comment"" or ""I don't wish to comment"" or something similar to that written on his hand. I could see that he appeared to be extremely nervous and I attempted to calm him down and following that we had a longer conversation about matters that relate to this."" (21.8.12 - T.10.18)

13Other evidence given by Detective Whale concerning this meeting was as follows:

""Q. Well what did you observe that made you be of the view that he was nervous? 
A. He was sweating profusely, his voice was very shaky and at some point he was on the verge of tears and I could tell that he just didn't know what to say to me."" (T21.8.12 - T.11.1)

""Q. Can you tell us what the effect of that conversation was?
A. Yes. I cautioned him that if this time he failed to tell me who was the owner of the motor vehicle and then who was driving the motor vehicle at a particular time of day that he would be committing an offence for which I could take legal action."" (21.8.12 - T.11.46)

""Q. Who did he say was driving the motor vehicle?
A. He said he was driving the motor car.

Q. Do you recall who he said the passengers were?
A. Yes, Marwan Salim, Robert Rad and his daughter.

Q. Whose daughter was that?
A. Sorry, Mr Phillips's daughter.

Q. Was there any further exchange between you and Mr Phillips after that?
A. Yes.

Q. What was that?
A. Mr Phillips went on to tell me that he'd just come from seeking legal advice. He told me that he was told to say certain things. He also told me that he had further evidence that he could get hold of in the form of documents that would show that he was innocent of any crime in relation to the Marwan Salim matter and that he had a witness who would provide evidence in the form of a statement, again in relation to the Marwan Salim matter."" (21.8.12 - T.12.11)

14Detective Whale made arrangements for Mr Phillips to obtain those documents and return to the police station on 10 February. On 10 February Mr Phillips attended the police station accompanied by his mother and a Mr Kewin. Detective Whale said:

""A. On that occasion I informed Mr Phillips that I intended to interview him as a suspect not in custody. He was taken to an interview room and he was formally electronically interviewed after speaking to the custody manager. Following that interview a statement was obtained from Dale Phillips, his mother."" (21.8.12 - T.12.42)

Mr Phillips was not legally represented on this occasion.

15Mr Phillips provided Detective Whale with a two page typed document which became Exhibit A in the proceedings. The contents of that document were:

""At approximately 2pm while I was babysitting my daughters at there house I had a knock at the door from the neighbour Marwan Salem who asked me how he would go about receiving some money and a car for collateral on some money that a man owed him for work that this man did not/ could not complete on his shop because the man was arriving with both these items. I then said ""all I know is that if he is signing over money and the car, the only legal way I know would be to right it down and have both parties sign the document and date it. That's usually binding in a court of law"". Marwan then asked could you please write it out as I am not good with this stuff please. I replied ""ok"". I then got pen and paper and began to write it out for him leaving out the mans name for him to fill in when he arrived. At around 2:15pm the man arrived in a black Honda CRV who parked out the front of Marwans residents who then came over where Marwan was sitting out the front of my daughter's house.

They then proceeded to talk as I went inside. I came back out as they were signing and finalising what they were going to do, they asked for the date upon signing and I said the 27th. While I was standing there hearing that the man hadnt brought the money like he apparently said he was going to, he only bought the car. Marwan said I don't want your car, I need my money, my shop has a deadline and you know this, what good is the car to me? And they continued to talk as I went back inside to my daughter and a friend of mine who was in the house visiting. As I went outside for the second time Marwan then indicated that the man was willing to sign another car over because he did not have the money and if it wasnt too much trouble if I could drive himself and this man over to this mans house as asked by this man, which I then said yes, but youll have to give me 15mins because I have my daughter, they both said no problem.

I got myself and my daughter ready, went out the front and got in my car, as they were getting on the car, I asked Marwan if he could please sit in the back with my daughter as I don't know this man and I dont like strangers near my daughter, she knows you Marwan and it will be easier, so the man then sat in the front passenger seat as I requested. He said no problem. We then drove along Hume highway onto Camden Valley way passing the m7 and going to the service station meters from the m7 to get fuel for my car, after getting fuel we then left the service station in the opposite direction heading back to the m7 where we entered at the Camden valley way entrance at around 3:28pm where he directed me to get off ""I think"" it was Norwest avenue exit on the m7. 
He then verbally told me left right left right until we came to a stop at the front his house on the opposite side of the road. He got out of the car by himself and went inside we waited around 15mins until either the man called Marwan on the mobile or Marwan called the man. The man then invited Marwan in as he was looking for the paper work, while I stayed in the car with my daughter. I waited around a few minutes before they come out together. Marwan then said wait 1 minute we just got to go around the corner. Not knowing what they were doing the man directed Marwan around the corner into a colder sack, where after a minute they both came back in the man's car with the man driving.

He then pulled into his own drive way by reversing in where he then asked Marwan if he could please take some tools out cause he has jobs he has to finish and if he cant finish them he cant get the money. Marwan replied of course you can I dont want your tools or your cars I just want my money, but your telling me you dont have it and to take your cars. Marwan then asked if I could just give them a hand lifting some tools out and putting them beside this mans house where he directed. As we were doing this the mans neighbour (an Asian lady) came out and was standing a meter or 2 away from the car, I said hello to this lady and so did Marwan and she replied hello. We finished unloading and Marwan and I got back into my car with my daughter, Marwan was then sitting in the front passenger seat. The man then began to drive his car down the street and directed us to follow so we did.

He led us down to a shell petrol station a couple of streets away from his house, we pulled in to a parking spot and waited for him to get fuel, after he fuelled up he then led us down through Quakers hill until we got back on to the m7 at around 4:45pm. Followed him down the m7 where he was driving in front of my car, Marwan rang his mobile whilst on the m7 telling him to slow down and not to speed as we got a kid in the car. Getting close to Camden valley way exit, I think Marwan rang him again telling him to get off at the Camden valley way exit and not take the exit before that one, its easier to get off at Camden valley way.

Exiting the m7 we headed home along the Hume highway until we got back to my daughters house. Upon arriving at my daughters house Marwan and the man still discussed some information, I went inside with my daughter. Marwan then came back over and asked me for another favour that if I would give this man a lift to Casula station, I replied yes. The man then realised he had left a tool that he needed and took it out of the van and brought in with him. We then got into my car again with Marwan in the back with my daughter and the man in the front passenger seat. I drove him to Casula station where there is a set of stairs at the top which leads you to Casula station.

He then got out and walked down the stairs, I then drove back to my daughter's house where I dropped Marwan off, he said thank you and I went inside with my daughter.""

16Mr Kewin also provided a statement to the police in relation to the Salim matter.

17The evidence of Detective Whale continued:

""Q. What other information was provided to you by Mr Phillips on that day?
A. Mr Phillips informed me in the late stages of that interview that he had received legal advice from Mr Michael that related to our interview when he came in I think it was January to answer questions in relation to the driving of his vehicle.

Q. You've given us two dates in January, one was 19 January, the other was 28 January?
A. Yeah, 28 January. He informed me that whilst he and his mother were present with Mr Michael, Mr Michael told him to tell untruths, told him that lots of people drive his car and that he couldn't remember perhaps who was driving the vehicle on any given day and time and he told me that Mr Michael suggested to his mother that she may have been driving the car at the particular time. He also informed me that he had provided the document that I referred to before, the typewritten two-page document to Mr Michael. (21.8.2012, T.13.40 - 14.4)

...

Q. You told us that Mr Phillips told you that the accused had told him to go and provide you, the police, with or to say to you, the police, that he couldn't remember who was driving his car on that day; did he tell you when the accused told him that or when he had that discussion with the accused that is when Mr Phillips had that discussion with the accused?
A. That morning.

HER HONOUR: Q. Well what do you mean by ""that morning"" that would then be the morning of what, the morning of?
A. 10 February your Honour. (21.8.12 - T.14.38)

...

Q. Were the charges against Marwan Salim eventually withdrawn?
A. Yes.

Q. And why was that or what led to that?
A. Based on the evidence supplied by Mr Phillips, the distinct lack of evidence on the telephone intercept material, the evidence of Mr Kewin and the documentary evidence that was provided that I provided to the DPP who were running the Marwan Salim case at that time and then I was advised by them that the matter will be withdrawn."" (21.8.12 - T.15.26)

18Under cross-examination Detective Whale said that when Mr Phillips was asked to attend the police station on 19 January 2011, he was under investigation as a possible co-offender with Mr Salim. It was for that reason that his mobile telephone calls had been lawfully intercepted. It was for that reason he was interviewed as a suspect not in custody.

19Detective Whale said that he had made two statements in relation to the proceedings against the applicant. He said that when Mr Phillips attended the police station on 31 January 2011 he made some notes in his duty book about what Mr Phillips told him in relation to Mr Salim's matter, but he did not make any notes about what he told him in relation to the applicant. He agreed that in his statement of 19 October 2011 he made no mention of Mr Phillips attending at the police station on 31 January and what he had said on that occasion. Detective Whale accepted that his evidence concerning what was said by Mr Phillips on 31 January 2011 was based solely on his memory.

20In relation to when Mr Phillips consulted his lawyers, Detective Whale said:

""Q. 10 February, mum was there as well?
A. Yes.

Q. And they'd come from seeing the lawyers then as well?
A. I don't recall.

Q. Didn't you tell us that yesterday?
A. I think it was on the 10th that they had come directly from their lawyers.

Q. But not on the 31st?
A. No, no I think it was on the 10th that they'd come from their lawyers.

Q. Would it be fair to say that there's some confusion in your mind about distinguishing those two different appointments with Mr Philips?
A. No.

Q. You're not perhaps getting the details of one confused with another?
A. Well you indicated previously that they'd come from their lawyers on the 31st. If I am confused I'm confused about what they may have done prior to coming to see me. I do believe however that they came from their lawyers on the 10th. I wasn't with them prior to that."" (22.8.12 - T.67.24 - 68.3)

21On the same issue Detective Whale said:

""Q. And you can't be certain that anything was said about Mr Michael on 31 January 2011 can you?
A. Yes.

Q. And is it the case detective that you're relying solely on your own memory for that?
A. Yes.

Q. And you'd agree with me that there are absolutely no contemporaneous notes at all, any mention of Mr Michael on 31 January 2011?
A. I didn't make any notes of that meeting with Mr Phillips."" (22.8.12 - T.80.19)

22Mr Phillips gave evidence for the Crown. His evidence was as follows:

""Q. Did you have any concerns yourself when you found out that Mr Salim had been charged?
A. Yes I did.

Q. Why was that?
A. Once I found out what the actual charge was and exactly what happened, what the police had actually said in their statement, I actually was there on the day and knew the truth to the statement, so I'd actually wanted to physically put my truth to that story to the police so that way they knew the exact whereabouts and times of where we were and what happened that day.

Q. Did you talk to anybody about wanting to put your truth in the story to the police?
A. Yes.

Q. Who did you talk to?
A. Fabian Michaels.

...

Q. At some point did you meet Mr Michael?
A. Yes.

Q. And how did that come about?
A. Well, I spoke to Marwan, Marwan organised a meeting and then we met in Fabian's office.

Q. And where was Fabian's office?
A. In the city.

Q. Do you remember whereabouts in the city?
A. Not the exact address, no.

Q. Do you remember when it was that you met in that office?
A. No I can't recall exactly the date, but it was only a couple of weeks after the actual date of the offence.

Q. And who was present at that meeting?
A. Marwan Salim, myself and Fabian Michaels.

Q. Do you recall what was discussed at that meeting?
A. Yes. I basically went in there as a character reference, I dictated everything down on a piece of paper of all the true events of what I thought and I presented them as a character reference for Marwan Salim to Fabian Michaels to present to the courts or police station.

Q. Did you say you presented that?
A. Yeah well I actually sat there, I gave a verbal, I gave them a verbal thereabouts of it all, I had a time line sort of already written down and sort of dictated, and basically yeah, I gave him all the run downs that day of what I thought as a character reference, what I could remember. (22.8.12 - T.95.45 - 97.3)

...

Q. Do you remember anything that you said to Mr Fabian Michael on that day?
A. Yes, I told him who was driving the car, I told him the exact story on how I seen it, I told him that my daughter was in the car, I told him that basically that we were innocent, that this was not correct, that this did not happen, there was no extortion, there was no violence, there was no nothing, it was just a straight up favour for a neighbour. I had my one year old daughter in the car and basically just told him the story on how it went down.

Q. Did Mr Fabian Michael say anything to you about that?
A. He basically told me that it was irrelevant at the moment, that he really didn't need to know the information and that until it all went through the court sort of thing basically, it was all like never gave me a straight answer, everything was sort of always, you know, just always felt like I never got an answer out of it, you know what I mean, it was always like if you say this, just always made excuses up, if you know what I mean. I didn't get an actual physical proper answer out of him, as in like if you go and do this, this is what will happen, it was always but, but, but, but, but."" (22.8.12 - T.97.36)

23Mr Phillips said that Mr Salim introduced the applicant to him as a solicitor. He said that no advice was given to him at that time by the applicant, except that he should go home and dictate everything onto a piece of paper and just time line it all.

24The next time Mr Phillips came in contact with the applicant was at a kebab shop, some time later. The persons present were Mr Phillips, his mother, Mr Salim and the applicant. Mr Phillips' evidence concerning this meeting was:

""Q. Do you recall what was discussed at that meeting?
A. Yes. By this time I was actually - I think I was actually being asked to come and see Detective Whale at this time. That's why we went up to see Fabian Michael for some legal advice. At the time, I'd asked my mum to come in and sort of see what was going on, because I just didn't feel that I was getting the right help, if you know what I mean. So I got my mum to come up to listen and see what was going on just to see that I was - making sure that everything was all right and have a second opinion on, if you know what I mean. When we arrived up there, I didn't really ask much questions at all; I didn't really talk to Fabian too much, I let my mum discuss a few things, because my mum is a bit more knowledgeable at this sort of stuff. I'm not too knowledgeable in the Court systems. From then on there, my mum just continued on trying to get an answer out of him, like, ""What are you doing to my son?"" ""Are you doing as much for my son as you are for Marwan? It just seems like you're telling my son to say no and this sort of stuff, so what are you going to do?"" So at the end of the day, it was really a conversation between them. I just stood back and just - I didn't really answer or talk to Fabian really at all. It was really Mum and Fabian who had the talk.

Q. Just go back a step, you said that one of the reasons for you meeting with, or going to this meeting was that you weren't really getting - you didn't feel like you were getting the right help. What did you mean by that?
A. Well I - when I'd spoken to Fabian I put through that the person in question, which is Marwan Salim, is innocent, I've got time lines, M7 documented times that I'd actually taken the car onto there which actually had the time of entry, time of exit, I had - I wanted to tell him that I knew where I was at the time that I was on CCTV camera at the Shell Service Station at Norwest, also at Camden Valley Way. (22.8.12 - T.100.15)

...

Q. Sorry, so you - continue, you said you didn't feel like you were getting the right help?
A. Yes, and so the first time when I spoke to Fabian I put through that the man was innocent and the vibe that I got was it didn't matter if he was innocent, doesn't matter about anything else, you know, it was basically irrelevant, just have to wait, it all got brought up later on, you know what I mean, it wasn't good information for him. Do you know what I mean, it just didn't seem like he was going to take that solid evidence and present it to anybody, just seemed like it got put on the backburner.

Q. What did you understand that he meant when he said that it didn't matter about innocence?
A. Well to me it just seemed like it didn't matter at this time, it meant more in future date after the arrest had been made or if, you know, the courts came up and you have to present it in court, that's when he would use that evidence. Right now he actually told me he doesn't need to read over it, doesn't need to do anything, you know what I mean, that sort of stuff, he just told me he doesn't need any of that, ""Go home, dictate it and I'll tell you when I need it"".

Q. And you told us that you went home and you dictated it?
A. Mm-hmm.

Q. Did you have that document with you at this meeting at the kebab shop?
A. Tell you the truth I can't recall if I did or not. No I can't recall. It's too long ago, I can't recall I'm sorry.

Q. Was there any discussion about what was in that document at this meeting at the kebab shop?
A. Yes.

...

Q. Do you remember any specific conversation that you had with Mr Michael about what was in the document that you've prepared?
A. On the night, like I said at the kebab shop I didn't really speak to him too much at that night there, yeah I didn't really - my mum said more than what I did. I didn't really, yeah, speak too much up there, I brought my mum up to be my solicitor because to grill and find out what was going on before I ended up doing time for something that I had nothing to do with.

Q. Can you remember any specific questions that your mother asked Mr Michael?
A. Yeah, one of the statements that he made - she made was that ""I don't feel that you're doing as much as what you are for Marwan Salim"". It seems like - actually the exact words were, ""It seems like you're using my son as your scapegoat"", that's the exact words that came out of her mouth.

Q. What if anything did Mr Michael say in response to that?
A. Well he just laughed it off as, you know that would never happen, ""We'd never do that to your son"". If I remember correctly he was like ""We would never lock up someone for their own ... or whatnot, we're here to like find out the innocence and whatnot of the whatsaname"", but it just didn't seem like he wanted to listen to my side of the story or take it down, like I had more time lines than anyone else, I had all the documents, it was my car, I knew all the knowledge and everything and it just didn't seem like anyone wanted to take any notice."" (22.8.12 - T.101.3 - 102.16)

25Mr Phillips remembered receiving a phone call from Detective Whale. Detective Whale told him that he wanted to speak to him to discuss what happened with Mr Salim and answer some questions. As a result, Mr Phillips arranged to meet Detective Whale at the Quakers Hill Police Station a couple of days after the phone call. Mr Phillips said that the telephone conversation with Detective Whale occurred after the meeting with the applicant at the kebab shop.

26Mr Phillips said that when he went to the Quakers Hill Police Station on 19 January 2011 he was accompanied by the applicant and a person called John. He met John for the first time at the Blacktown train station when he picked up both him and the applicant to drive them to the police station. Mr Phillips' evidence as to what happened when they arrived at the police station was:

""Q. And what happened when you arrived at Quakers Hill Police Station?
A. Well, we got to Quakers Hill Police Station and we pulled around the corner, I was told to pull up at Quakers Hill train station so that John and Fabian could have a brief read over my statement and my paperwork that I had. We sat there, it was give or take 20 minutes. They read over my statement and basically walked in and told me to say nothing. After walking in and saying nothing Detective Whale then told me to go, he doesn't need me there.

Q. Who told you to walk in and say nothing.
A. Fabian."" (22.8.12 - T.105.29)

It was common ground that the statement to which Mr Phillips referred was Exhibit A.

27His evidence continued:

""Q. When was the first time you showed that to Mr Michael?
A. The first time I show that to Mr Michaels was I think in the car with John.

Q. When you say ""in the car with John"", are you talking about this time that you were on your way to --
A. In the car out the front of Quakers Hill train station on the way to see Detective Whale at Quakers Hill Police Station.

Q. Did you see whether or not Fabian Michael or John read that document when you handed it to them?
A. Yeah, they both quickly gave it a read over and had a little discussion between themselves and came up with my answer to tell the Detective.

Q. When you say ""had a little discussion between themselves"", do you recall what they said?
A. No, they were - it was yeah, out of my league, I didn't know what they were talking about, they were talking about laws and different things and stuff like that, different things they could use in the statement. I wasn't paying too much attention at that stuff there. I was just telling the truth on the day, I was very, very, very, very stressed out, yeah. I basically had to go to the doctor's all through that month because my stress levels were way up there so. (22.8.12 - T.106.13)

...

Q. This was in the car that you showed them the document, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. Was the document returned to you?
A. Yes.

Q. And did you then keep that document?
A. I can't recall, I can't recall that, sorry, I can't remember that back what I did with that, if I gave them and then got another copy or if I - I just can't remember back that far, I'm sorry. I can't remember what I did with that.

Q. Do you recall whether or not you made more than one copy?
A. Yes, yes, there's more than one copy.

Q. What did you do with the copies?
A. One of them, my Mum's got one, I had one, and I had one for just floating around purposes for in case, you know, anyone wanted one, so I'm assumed, I'm pretty sure I might've gave them on that day, I just don't want to say if it's incorrect or whatnot, but yeah, I just can't remember when I actually gave them a copy.""(22.8.12 - T.107.40 - 108.9)

28Mr Phillips' evidence as to how he came to be accompanied by the applicant and John on 19 January 2011 was:

""Q. How did it come about that you met with those two men at Blacktown?
A. I received a phone call off Detective Whale stating that he wanted to speak to me in regards to the matter. I then panicked. I don't have any solicitors or any - anything like that, so I spoke to Marwan and Marwan got on the phone and basically told him that we needed to come and see him at now and it's gone further, Detective Whale now wants to charge Daniel in relation to the offence.

...

Q. Just start again, how did it happen? Just start again? 
A. I got a phone call off Detective Whale and he told me that I was going to be - he had to ask some questions and may be charged in relations of what happened on that day. I then ran across the road to Marwan Salim, panicking, asking him to ring his solicitor because now I need legal representation for myself.

...

Q. Do you remember the conversation that you had with Fabian?
A. Yeah he just told me not to panic sort of thing and that's all I really remember was basically he told me not to panic, it's all right, ""The worse thing they can do to you is charge you.""

Q. Was there some arrangement then made to meet with Mr Fabian Michael at Blacktown Railway Station?
A. Yes that's correct.

Q. And who instigated that? Was it you that asked for Mr Michael to be present or did he say to you that he would come along and represent you or what was the - how did it go?
A. From my recollection I think - I can't really remember to tell you the truth. I'm trying to remember.

Q. Were you charged any money for this--
A. Yeah, I paid $500 on the day, I walked in for two minutes and paid Fabian $500."" (22.8.12 - T.111.17)

...

Q. So who advised you to bring the $500?
A. Fabian. I've never spoken to anyone else in regards to this case apart from Fabian.

Q. What did he say the $500 was for?
A. For turning up to speak to the police.

Q. For who turning up?
A. For them turning up for Fabian and John turning up. Because I didn't know what John's role was, all I know is every time Fabian wanted to do something he'd discuss it with John."" (22.8.12 - T.112.6)

29Mr Phillips said that some time later Detective Whale telephoned him and told him that he had more questions for him. They agreed on a date when Mr Phillips would attend the police station. Mr Phillips contacted Mr Salim, who then contacted the applicant on his behalf. Mr Phillips said that he cancelled the first date because he wanted to speak to the applicant first. He said:

""A. I spoke to Detective Whale telling him that I couldn't make it on that day and he said, ""Look that's fine, there's no rush as long as you come in and see me within the week that's fine"", so I did."" (22.8.12 - T.112.41)

30Mr Phillips thought that he only met Detective Whale on two occasions. He said that he did not make a note of the number of times that he spoke to Detective Whale. In relation to the second time that he saw Detective Whale Mr Phillips said:

""Q. When you went to see Detective Whale on the second time, did you - sorry, do you remember what the date of that was?
A. It was the day that I made the statement, I can't remember the date, but it was the day that I made the statement.

Q. Just the day that you made the recorded interview with Detective Whale?
A. That's correct.

Q. Had you seen or met with Fabian Michael again before going and seeing Detective Whale, that is in between the time that you went, the first time you went into the police station and the second time?
A. Yes, I met with him in the city for a brief meeting.

Q. Do you recall where that was?
A. Beside his office in the city."" (22.8.12 - T.113.24)

31Mr Phillips identified the day when he signed the statement as 10 February 2011. His recollection was that he signed the statement after he had participated in the electronic interview at the police station. He was then asked questions about meeting the applicant before going to the police station on that day. His evidence was:

""Q. Just go back, you said that you met, on the same day you said that you met Mr Michael in the city beside his office, whereabouts was it beside his office?
A. There's a little alleyway beside his office where there's some café shops, like little takeaway café shop, and we just sat in there at a little table and chairs with an umbrella. He took our mobile phones off us and put them behind the café shop's counter and we sat down and had a briefing.

...

Q. Are you able to say with reference to any streets or buildings or anything like that in the city where this meeting took place?
A. Yeah, something Tower, I think it's called, I don't know the name of it or whatnot, I've only been there twice in my whole entire life so - like I said again, them times I was under a lot of stress, so didn't pay attention to my surroundings, I was only there for one reason, and one reason only, and was to clear my name and get out of there safely.

Q. Who was present at that meeting?
A. My mother and Fabian Michaels. (22.8.12 - T.114.21)

...

Q. I'll just go back a step: can you remember the words of the exact conversation that you had with Mr Michael leading up to organising that meeting?
A. Yeah. I spoke with - I spoke to him and he told me that he couldn't come out and see us and we'd have to go in and see him in the city. So I spoke - I rang my mother and told her about the situation and she said, ""Let's go in and get it done asap"", so we just went straight in there. The conversation was just brief on the phone; it wasn't anything about any information. It was just basically we were going to me up at --

Q. Was there any conversation about what it was the police were going to ask you?
A. Yes. 

Q. I'm talking about on the telephone?
A. No, not on the telephone. At the - at the kiosk or the café there was, but not on the telephone. 

Q. Can you remember what conversation you had with Mr Michael using - as best you can - referring to the exact conversation if you can to the words that were said?
A. On the mobile phone or at --

Q. At the meeting?
A. At the café? 

Q. Yes?
A. We were taken around to the side to the café, sat down at a table and the conversation basically started off as in, ""I've spoken to John, we've come up with an answer for you to say. That answer is this answer,"" and he came up with, ""I don't know who was driving the car on the day"" that ""Heaps of people drive my car: friends, family, mother, father et cetera. Now I can either come down there and say this for you or you can either go down there and say it and save yourself $500."" 

Q. When he said ""answer to say"", what did you understand that he was--
A. My understanding--

Q. -- answer to what?
A. My understanding is that he - Fabian and Detective Whale had already had a conversation about the two questions that I was supposed to answer. Fabian rang me back and told me that he had spoken to Detective Whale and that he wanted to ask me two questions. They were specific questions. He told me, but I can't recall that he told me the exact questions, so I went to the city to speak to Fabian and to have that meeting to get an answer for both those questions, that they'd already organised on the phone previous to me.

Q. You've told us Fabian Michael has told you the answer to the question, your answer to the question should be - one question is that you don't know who was driving your car on that day, did you say anything to him in respect to that answer when he suggested that to you?
A. Yes. Yeah, I did. I told him that I didn't want to like bring my family into it or friends and that. I'm an innocent - I told him I was innocent that basically that all this didn't happen, I don't want to bring my friends and family into it too. 

Q. Your evidence so far has been that you knew who was driving the car on that day. Is that correct? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. Well did you say that to Mr Michael?
A. Yes. 

...

Q. What did you say to Mr Michael when he said to you that you should answer the question who was driving your car by responding you don't know who was driving your car. What if anything did you say to Fabian Michael?
A. So what did I say to him after he told me that I should tell the police that - my response, I was shocked. I didn't want to bring my family and friends and everybody who was close and dear to me into this rigmarole because I was already in it as an innocent person, I didn't want to bring anyone else into it. So that was definitely against my - what I was going to do.

Q. Do you remember what your answer was to --
A. I couldn't tell you.

Q. Do you recall whether or not you did answer the question?
A. Yeah. I told him around the same - the lines that I didn't want to implement my friends and family. That was what I told him basically, but I can't remember the exact words that were said. No.

Q. Did you have the two page document that we've been referring to, exhibit A? Did you have that with you on that day?
A. No, I'm pretty sure that Fabian would already have a copy of that. I think my mother emailed him a copy just as a reassurance that he had it, he got it.

Q. Was there any discussion about the contents of that document at this meeting at the café?
A. No, there was no - there was no response to my statement at all, there was never one. Like, my statement never ever came into our conversation it was always what could be said to not say my statement.

Q. Sorry, could you just - I might need you to explain that a bit.
A. Every time I said my statement my statement was irrelevant. I needed to basically like have a different answer for that. So if I said this is what I said they were saying ""You can't say that, you need to say this.""

Q. Well, was that - any conversation similar to that take place at this meeting at the café in the city?
A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall exactly what the conversation was?
A. Yes, he said to me that if I said the wrong word that the police would twist it around and I could be locked up or charged for saying the wrong thing.

...

Q. You've said that you didn't want to implement your family, what do you mean by the word --
A. I meant incriminate when I did that statement. I'm not - I don't use those big words. I hardly ever use those words but, yeah, that's what I meant by that was incriminate.

Q. Incriminate.
A. It says implement on the statement but, yeah, it was incriminate, which means bringing my family and friends into a criminal action that they had nothing to do with.

Q. Do you remember what, if anything, was said to you when you told Fabian Michael that you didn't want to incriminate, or words to that effect, your family?
A. He basically just gave me the answer to say to Detective Whales after that which was basically to say I didn't know who was driving the car and he went along to say, you know, like something about dates, either police were saying - I'm not too - I can't really recall it too much, sorry, to tell you the truth. I'm just - I'm trying to remember it all, it was too long ago.

...

Q. You were motioning to your hand there, what was that in reference to?
A. Fabian got me to write down my statement on my hand, to show Detective Whale and the way he had writ it on my hand I could not say it because them words do not physically come out of my mouth. The words that he - the sentence that he writ down it was coming out like wrong.

Q. What was --
A. He got it writ down on my hand that I could practise it all the way to the police station in the car.

Q. What were the words, can you remember?
A. Somewhere to the content of, ""I don't know who was driving the car on this day"", or something like that.

Q. Did you understand the words?
A. I understood them but they just didn't seem like they were coming out of my mouth fluently.

HER HONOUR: Q. Who wrote it on your hand?
A. I physically writ it on my hand but he told me, ""Write it on your hand. Write this on your hand, that way you can practise it on the way to the police station"". And Detective Whale seen it because I showed him because I was there because after I'd said that.

Q. Your earlier evidence was that you had handed a document to 
Fabian Michael stating that you were the driver of the car and who were the passengers in the car and you told us that there was some discussion about that document between Fabian and John in your presence. Did the content of that document or the fact that you did know who was the driver of the car come up in this conversation at the café in the city?
A. No, Fabian already knew that I was the driver, he knew my daughter was in the car, he knew everything about that already so that conversation."" (22.8.12 - T.115.20 - 119.7)

32The above evidence at T.115.47, T.118.12 and T.118.35 comprised the evidence of Mr Phillips in chief as to the offence. That evidence was given against a background of Mr Phillips having told the applicant on a number of previous occasions that he was the driver of the car at the relevant time.

33Mr Phillips went on to say:

""Q. At the time that you were having that conversation with Mr Michael in the coffee shop and he was telling you to say that you didn't know who the driver of your car was, you knew at that point that that wasn't the truth, is that correct?
A. That's correct.

Q. And was the fact that you knew that that wasn't true ever raised with Mr Michael at that time?
A. Not at that time no.

Q. Why didn't you raise it with him at that time?
A. Because I'd already raised it to him previously and I was only there to get answers for the questions that Fabian organised with Detective Whale, so the meeting was just about the two questions that the detective was going to ask, not about anything else, nothing more, nothing less.

Q. After you left the meeting at the café what did you do?
A. Made my way to the Quakers Hill Police Station."" (22.8.12 - T.119.36 - T.120.2)

34Mr Phillips said that the applicant told him to hand over his mobile phone and all recording devices to the waitress at the cafe because the police could tap phones. Mr Phillips did not question the applicant about that, but he and his mother handed over their mobile phones to the waitress. He said that he had $500 on him at the time to pay for someone to come with him to the police station, but because he had written something on his hand he was prepared to go to the police station and save himself the $500. Mr Phillips said that when he went to the police station he was accompanied by his mother.

35Mr Phillips' evidence was that he was so nervous by the time he got to the police station, that he could not remember what to say and as a result, Detective Whale said that he would have to charge him. Mr Phillips' evidence was:

""A. I couldn't talk. I lose it. I just - my mum was sitting there. I couldn't talk to him. I broke down in front of him. I just said to him, ""Mate. No, no, no, no, no"" and then I said ""Just, no, just stop"" and then basically I said ""Look, mate, I've been told to say this. I've been trying to tell the truth, I've been trying to get my statement on record."" Basically from then on there he just said to me, ""Look, have a chat with me, tell me a briefing of it, of your side of it. I'll turn the microphone off, we'll have a man to man discussion, tell me what you think. So I told him exactly what I thought and my recollections of that day and he told me to put it on as a statement. Would I put that on and I said ""No problem at all"". So we began to put it on the statement and on file.

Q. When you say put it on a statement are you referring to the electronic?
A. Yes. Yes, put my statement onto an electronic device. Yes. I already had my statement handwritten out already and just passed it on to Detective Whales after I'd already gave him a little bit of a briefing.

Q. Did you have any other documents with you?
A. Yes, I had my M7 timelines. I also had some writing on a bit of paper of the exact time that I pulled into the two service stations before and after. Yeah, just the timelines of entering the M7 and exiting the M7."" (22.8.12 - T.122.19)

36Mr Phillips said that he had Mr Kewin with him on that day. When asked what he told Detective Whale that the applicant had said, Mr Phillips' evidence was:

""Q. Can you remember exactly what it was that you told the detective that Fabian Michael had told you to say?
A. I can't really remember the exact words, but it was just along the lines of, ""Didn't know who was driving my car,"" yeah and just basically about that - it had come down to basically who was driving my car, because the two questions that were asked were around my car, it was all around my car: where was my car, did I know where my car was at this time, or something like that. It was all questions towards my car."" (22.8.12 - T.125.15)

37During cross-examination Mr Phillips said that he may have visited the police station on three occasions:

""Q. Why do you say that, Mr Phillips?
A. Because after sitting down and recapping after yesterday, I'm - I'm missing a little part of my story which basically is when we arrived at a police station, so I think I might be getting them mixed up, I'm not too sure, but at the end of the day it's two or three times. 

Q. Mr Phillips, are you making this up as you go along?
A. No, because it should be on record when I went into the police station."" (23.8.12 - T.156.47)

Mr Phillips' recollection was that his mother accompanied him to the police station on one occasion only.

38When cross-examined about 31 January 2011 Mr Phillips said:

""Q. Do you remember that on 31 January you went into the police station and spoke to Detective Whale, remember doing that?
A. On what day, sorry?

Q. 31 January 2011?
A. I'm not too sure if I did or not.

Q. A little bit longer than a week before your interview?
A. Yeah probably.

Q. Probably or you remember it?
A. I don't know the dates, I really can't remember to tell you the truth.

Q. Didn't you go in to see the detective a little more than a week before your interview where you told him everything?
A. I can't remember, I can't remember back that far.

Q. You can't remember?
A. No.

Q. No memory at all--
A. I thought it, I thought it was the same day, I thought it was the same day to tell you the truth. It was that long ago I can't remember, I cannot remember the days that I went in on, on to see a police officer or what-not and I got knocked back and told another date.

Q. Well don't you remember that you said to the detective, ""I can go away and get some evidence.""?
A. Actually I do remember that, mm-hmm.

Q. See what I want to suggest to you is that on 31 January you had already told Detective Whale what had happened between Mr Rad and Marwan?
A. I gave him brief, brief discussion --

Q. No, I want to suggest to you you had told him what had happened?
A. No.

Q. You had told him your role?
A. Briefly.

Q. You had told him that it was your motor vehicle that was involved?
A. Briefly.

Q. You had told him that you were the driver?
A. Briefly yes.

Q. So you had no need to go and consult with Mr Michael on 10 February and find out how to answer any questions did you?
A. Why - yes I did. (23.8.12 - T.186.9)

...

Q. Well what I'm suggesting to you is that you told the detective your version of what had happened and that's why you had to go and get the evidence to back it up?
A. Mm-hmm.

Q. Is that right?
A. Pretty much yeah.

Q. Well it's right isn't it?
A. Pretty much yeah.

Q. Well what's not right?
A. But I can't recall - I don't know because I can't remember that day, I --

Q. Well why are you agreeing with it if you can't remember it?
A. Because if you're saying it, it must be true then.

Q. What I'm suggesting to you, Mr Phillips, is that on 10 February you didn't need to go and speak with Mr Michael to get legal advice because you had already answered the questions of Detective Whale?
A. No.

Q. You hadn't answered the questions?
A. No I hadn't answered his questions, no.

Q. So you'd given him a version but he still had more questions, is that right?
A. I - well at the end of it he didn't - I didn't answer the questions that he asked, I just told my story.

Q. So why did you need to go and see Mr Michael?
A. For some legal representation in case something went wrong."" (23.8.12 - T.188.10)

39Mr Phillips was cross-examined as to his recollection concerning conversations with the applicant:

""Q. I suggest to you that your memory in relation to the events as they concerned Mr Michael is not very clear?
A. Mm-hmm. 

Q. Do you agree with that?
A. In some parts. 

Q. This is one of those parts?
A. Not really. 

Q. You can't be certain that particular words were used in particular situations, can you?
A. No, but I can remember introducing Fabian to my mother as my solicitor. 

Q. You said that?
A. Mm-hmm. 

Q. Where was that?
A. The kebab shop, 12.30."" (23.8.12 - T.191.1)

40Mr Phillips was definite that he had introduced his mother to the applicant. He was definite that there had been a meeting at the kebab shop. He denied that the only meeting in the city involved his mother, John, the applicant and himself. He denied that the only meeting that took place with the applicant in the city was in an office. Mr Phillips said that the only time that he ever met John was when he picked him up at the Blacktown train station and took him to the police station. Mr Phillips denied that his mother had ever met John. Mr Phillips said that his mother had emailed a copy of Exhibit A to the applicant.

41Mr Phillips was cross-examined as to what the applicant said to him:

""Q. Mr Phillips it's your evidence, is it not, that you were told to say certain things?
A. Correct.

Q. And at the time that you were told to say those certain things you were given a reason for saying them?
A. That's correct.

Q. And the reason was that your words would be twisted otherwise?
A. That's correct.

Q. You were also told that you might get arrested, is that right?
A. Not by Fabian but by the police officer but I can't recall if Fabian and that said that either so that was my answer.

...

Q. Did you tell us yesterday Mr Michael - your Honour it's page 112 of the transcript at lines 16 to 17 - ""Every time Fabian wanted to do something he'd discuss it with John"". Is it the case that every time you spoke with Mr Michael and you asked him for some advice he would speak to John before telling you what to do?
A. No, he didn't do it that night at the kebab shop.

Q. He told you that he was going to speak to John about it, did he?
A. No.

Q. So every time he wanted to do something he'd discuss it with John?
A. Well once he found out something that he thought was all right he'd speak to John about it.

Q. You were never told you've got to go in to the police station and tell this lie to help Marwan out, were you?
A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Marwan was never given to you as the reason for going to the police and saying that you didn't know who was driving your car, is that right?
A. No.

Q. It's not right?
A. Mm hmm, it's not right.

Q. It's not right?
A. No.

Q. Okay, so Marwan was given as the reason is that right?
A. No, no sorry I've got it round the wrong way, sorry about that.

Q. So you're agreeing with me --
A. Mm hmm yep, sorry it's a little bit confusing I know.

Q. It's a little bit confusing?
A. I know, sorry.

Q. You're agreeing with me that no one ever said you've got to do this for Marwan?
A. No it wasn't for Marwan.

Q. The reason you understood you were going in there was to protect yourself, is that right?
A. At the end of the day and also be a witness for Marwan.

Q. Mr Phillips, I want to suggest to you that at no stage did anyone tell you that you have to go in there and lie?
A. That's incorrect."" (23.8.12 - T.194.39; T.195.30 - T.196.26)

42In re-examination Mr Phillips gave the following evidence:

""Q. You were asked some questions about whether or not you were uncertain about the days and dates that you had contact with Detective Whale and your answer was you're not certain about the days and dates but you're certain about what you said, what did you mean by that?
A. Well I'd been playing the actual events around in my head since the time it happened so every time I thought of something I was making sure that I had it down on the computer and just basically yeah put my statement down on the computer, so I sort of knew, I knew the events of that day better than I knew the timelines and like you know what I mean, I knew what happened, who was there and how, how it happened but I couldn't tell you the times, the date of that day or what the weather was."" (23.8.12 - T.201.40)

43Dale Phillips, Mr Phillips' mother, gave evidence in the Crown case. She said that some time after August 2010, he told her that he had received a phone call from the police and was in trouble. She said that Mr Phillips had borrowed $300 from her and $200 from Mr Salim to pay for a solicitor and a QC who accompanied him to the police station. When she asked Mr Phillips what had happened at the police station he said ""I don't know"".

44Some time after he had been to the police station, Mrs Phillips became aware that an appointment had been made for Mr Phillips to meet the applicant at a kebab shop on a Friday night. Mrs Phillips was concerned about the situation so she decided to accompany him to the meeting.

45Mrs Phillips said the meeting took place in late January 2011.

46Mrs Phillips said that the meeting took place at night in a kebab shop, which she believed was owned by Mr Salim. She said that Mr Salim, the applicant and Mr Phillips attended the meeting. Mrs Phillips asked some questions of the applicant, in particular what Mr Phillips was charged with and why he could not just go and tell his story to the police. She said that the applicant responded to the effect that Mr Phillips could get himself into trouble if what he said had a double meaning, but otherwise she did not have a clear recollection of what was said by the applicant, except that he did not directly answer the questions which she put to him.

47Mrs Phillips said that Mr Phillips asked a number of questions of the applicant, but that no satisfactory answers were given. When Mrs Phillips asked whether her son should go and get another solicitor, the applicant said ""Oh, you can go and get another solicitor if you want, that's up to you"" (23.8.12 - T.215.42).

48In relation to the charges, Mrs Phillips remembered the applicant saying something about kidnapping and extortion and taking somebody against their will and that it was very serious and that ""the boys could go to gaol for ten years or more"". In relation to whether any specific advice was given by the applicant at that meeting, Mrs Phillips said:

""Q. What did he say to him?
A. Basically not to turn up unassisted like without any legal help and that to not do anything, do not go and talk to the police, wait till you got representation and then you can go and then we can set the terms on what they can ask you. Daniel just kept saying to him, ""But why can't I just turn up and tell him what I know."" And they said you can but if they read it this way or that way then you've got yourself in trouble you've said the wrong thing."" (23.8.12 - T.216.19)

49Mrs Phillips gave evidence about another meeting with the applicant:

""Q. Did you see Fabian Michael any other time after that?
A. Once before we went to the police station.

Q. When was that?
A. On the day that Daniel turned up to the police station to make the statement - no, he made a statement two days later. We had to go and be questioned by Detective Whale and before we went there it was either going to be maybe one of them will come with us and that will cost us another $500 or we can go down and spend - have a meeting with them first and they can run us through what to say, what to do and what's going to happen when we get to the police station. So we went to the city and we had a meeting, which we thought we were having a meeting with this John and ended up having a meeting with Fabian in an alleyway and that's when he told us what to do and what to say and when we left there we went to Quakers Hill."" (23.8.12 - T.219.11)

50Mrs Phillips said the only people present at that meeting were the applicant, Mr Phillips and herself. The location was in an alleyway in the city between two buildings where there were cafeterias. She thought it was at ""Worlds Square"".

51Mrs Phillips gave evidence as to what occurred at the meeting:

""Q. What was discussed at that meeting?
A. What was discussed at that meeting was there'd been - Fabian told us that they've had discussions with the police and everything and they're only allowed to ask Daniel one, a couple of questions right, they're going to ask you your name, your address, is it your car and he said once you've answered them you don't have to answer anything else and if they ask you anything else this is what you have to say and he rehearsed him on what to say.

Q. He what him, sorry?
A. He rehearsed him on what to say.

Q. When you say rehearsed him what took place?
A. He said that ""I want you to sit back and go hmm"", what was that again, like you didn't hear him. He said to give yourself time to think and then he said he had to say, I can't remember the exact words, but he had to say ""I'm sorry I do not recall who was driving my car on that day"" and Daniel said ""Well I just got to tell them I don't know"" and he said ""No you can't say I don't know because if you say you don't know you're not satisfying the question, you must satisfy them with an answer to the question"", this is all of a - I didn't quite understand it all.

Q. Was that the only thing you can recall that he was told to say that he can't remember who was driving the car on the day?
A. No, no he wanted us to say that we all drove Daniel's car and we borrowed his car all the time and any one of us could've been driving his car that day.

Q. When you say ""He wanted us to say""?
A. Sorry, myself, he said friends, his father, sister, myself. He said ""You've driven his car before"" and I said ""I have"" and he said ""Lately"" and I said ""No"" and he said ""Yes you have"" so I said ""Okay"".

HER HONOUR: Q. What did you say when he said --
A. I said okay, I just left it at that, okay I said to him and he said we could get statements, we should get statements off other family members to say that they drive the car constantly and anyone who drives your car get statements off them to say that they drive your car and don't know what day it was.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Was it discussed what was the reason for getting these statements or what was to be done with them?
A. Because that way they can't say that you were driving your car."" (23.8.12 - T.221.39 - T.222.32)

52Mrs Phillips said that the applicant took their mobile phones and gave them to a person who was working in the cafe. Mrs Phillips went on to say:

""Q. During this meeting what was Daniel doing?
A. Sweating, sweating bullets, trying to concentrate on what Fabian was telling him to say.

Q. Was he able to concentrate - from your observation was he able to concentrate on what he was being told?
A. No, Daniel couldn't get it at all. It was like a sentence that Daniel wouldn't normally talk like, you know, and it wasn't coming natural to him saying it and he just kept getting it wrong, kept getting it wrong so Fabian would sit back and act like he was the person asking the question and Daniel was to answer it and every time he answered he said ""No stop, we'll go back again"" and he kept asking the question and getting Daniel to answer the question.

Q. Was anything else done to help Daniel remember what to say?
A. Yeah, he wrote it on Daniel's hand.

Q. Who wrote it on Daniel's hand?
A. Daniel wrote it on Daniel's hand. He told him he could though."" (23.8.12 - T.223.1)

53Mrs Phillips gave evidence that during this meeting Mr Phillips told the applicant on a number of occasions that he was the person who was driving the car and asked him to look at the Etags and told him to have a look at the CCTV which would show that he was driving the car. She said that before Mr Phillips went to the police, she had not made a written statement. Mrs Phillips said that after her son had had the meeting with the applicant and John at the police station, she emailed Exhibit A to the applicant. Mrs Phillips could not recall how she obtained the applicant's email address but was able to repeat it when giving her evidence.

54Mrs Phillips' evidence continued:

""Q. You just told us a moment ago that you knew that Fabian knew what he was telling to say wasn't true. Did Fabian say why he wanted Daniel to say that to the police?
A. Because if he said the wrong thing, he'd be charged and he could be charged and it's a very serious matter and he could be looking at gaol time, ten or fifteen years so he had to be very careful what he said."" (24.8.12 - T.234.5)

55In relation to how many times Mr Phillips went to the police station, Mrs Phillips said:

""Q. How many times are you aware of that Daniel went to the police station?
A. He met Fabian and John there once, then we went. I went with him once and then we went back a couple days later and he made a statement. (24.8.12 - T.234.48) 

...

Q. The first time you went to the police station with Daniel, do you recall how long you were at the police station for?
A. Not very long. The first - the first meeting I had with Detective Whale was after we went to Sydney and we had a meeting with Fabian in the city and that's when he had to go and say these things to Detective Whale. They had him so confused that when we walked in the door I was surprised, because Detective Whale said to me ""you come in too"", so I went in and sat with him as well.

...

Q. Just describe how he looked without --
A. Daniel. Daniel was a mess; Daniel was sweating; he was confused, he was at tears; he had tears in his eyes. And then when the detective asked him the first question, Daniel repeated what he was supposed to repeat, but he wasn't supposed to repeat it at that time.

Q. What was the first question that he was asked?
A. ""Is your name Daniel Phillips?""

Q. Do you recall what his answer was?
A. Daniel said, ""I don't recall,"" and completely muddled up. He'd rehearsed it that much that he answered the wrong answer. 

...

Q. You were just pointing at your hand then. What were you--
A. Because that's what Daniel had to repeat, that was written on his hand. I'd also written it on a piece of paper and had it on the dashboard for him, because the pen wouldn't work properly on Daniel's hand because his hand was sweating so much.

...

Q. What did he say to Detective Whale?
A. When Daniel mucked up what he was supposed to say and didn't say the right answer to the right question, he just put his head in his hands, he didn't know what to do, and Detective Whale just pushed the book aside that he had in front of him in folders and he pushed it aside and he said, ""Look, mate, what's going on?"" And Daniel said, ""What do I do, Mum?"" I said, ""Just tell him, tell him everything."" So then Daniel just started telling him and just never stopped.

...

Q. What was mentioned about Fabian to the police at that time?
A. Well, he asked naturally why Daniel wouldn't come in. Detective Whale had asked Daniel, rang Daniel a couple of times and asked him and come in and talk to him about it. So then we went on to say because we were told - he was told he couldn't and we told him the story, you know, that he shouldn't turn up because he could be arrested and he was looking at serious charges and Detective Whale said, ""Look, mate, all I ever wanted you to do was come and have a chat with me about it,"" you know. And then Daniel just went on to tell the whole story about everything that's happened right up to that point and the meeting that we'd had just prior to that, you know, right up to that point."" (24.8.12 - T.235.13 - T.237.10)

56Mrs Phillips said that she only ever had two meetings with the applicant. One was at the kebab shop and the other meeting was in the city in the alleyway. She provided the police with a statement on the second occasion that she went to the police station. Under cross-examination she confirmed that at the second meeting with the applicant Mr Phillips wrote the response to a question on the palm of his left hand.

57In cross-examination Mrs Phillips said:

""Q. Wasn't that the day that you made your statement?
A. No, the day we left Sydney to go to Quakers Hill for them to ask Daniel these questions, that's when Daniel got it wrong telling the detective everything that happened on that day, and he said to him, ""Well look relax now and do me a favour, go - just relax"", because he could see Daniel was very stressed, ""Just relax"", and he said, ""Have you got anybody else that was a witness on the day of the events when they -- Daniel gave these blokes a lift"". He said, ""Yeah, Chris."". He said, ""Can you bring Chris back with you?"" we said, ""Yes"". We booked in, I think it was a couple of days later, I think it might have been a Friday night, 5 o'clock or something, and we brought Chris, Daniel's friend, back with him and all three of us made a statement."" (24.8.12 - T.256.45)

58Mrs Phillips denied that she had only met the applicant on one occasion and that the meeting in the kebab shop did not take place. She denied that the only time she met the applicant was when he was accompanied by John. She denied that when she met with the applicant it was in an office in the city. Her answers on this issue were unqualified:

""Q. I want to suggest to you that the meeting that you had in the city, John was present and he was the one who was doing all the talking?
A. No, I've never met John.

Q. I want to suggest to you that it was John who told you about the law and that Daniel had to answer certain questions?
A. Never. I never spoke to John. I was questioning who this John was. I never met him. Never spoke to him.

Q. I want to suggest to you that you did get an opportunity to ask John questions about why Daniel had to answer this?
A. No, I never met him."" (24.8.12 - T.263.27)

59When further cross-examined on this issue, Mrs Phillips said:

""Q. There was never any occasion where you heard Mr Michael - Fabian say to Daniel that he had to tell a lie. You never heard him say anything like that?
A. He never said the word ""lie"".

HER HONOUR: Q. What did you say sorry?
A. He never said the word ""lie"" he just - when Daniel would say something he'd say ""You can't say that. You have to say it this way"" and he'd correct Daniel and told Daniel ""You can't say it that way"". He said when Daniel said when he was telling him to repeat this line over and over and over again and then he'd ask the question. He was acting like he was the detective asking Daniel a question and at one time Daniel said ""I don't know"". He said ""No, you can't say you don't know. You have to say I don't recall"". He said ""Because if you say you don't know, you're refusing to answer the question"". And it was, all this was new to me. I couldn't understand any of this."" (24.8.12 - T.265.1)

60The applicant did not give evidence. The only oral evidence in the defence case was from John Parnell, who had been a magistrate for 18 years and a barrister for 24 years. Mr Parnell had known the applicant for about 6 years. He had first met him when the applicant was working as a law clerk for a solicitor and for about 3 years, the applicant had done some clerking work for Mr Parnell, as well as directing clients to him. The applicant was studying law.

61Mr Parnell gave evidence that he was approached by the applicant to accompany Mr Phillips to the Quakers Hill Police Station where it was expected that Mr Phillips would be interviewed and arrested. Mr Parnell said that before accompanying Mr Phillips to the police station, he had not met him, knew nothing about the anticipated charges and did not even know Mr Phillips' name. He said that having met Mr Phillips, he did not provide any advice to him, did not in any way discuss charges likely to be laid nor the factual background to the anticipated charges. Mr Parnell said that when they arrived at the police station, he did not speak to the investigating officer but allowed the investigating officer to speak with Mr Phillips where he [Mr Parnell] could not hear what they were saying. No further conversation took place at the police station before they left.

62Mr Parnell said he was paid $300 by Mr Phillips for attending the Quakers Hill Police Station. He did not issue a receipt for this amount. He could not remember how the fee had been agreed. When Mr Phillips returned him and the applicant to the car-park, no arrangements were made for a further meeting. 

63Mr Parnell said that he met Mr Phillips again some weeks after the attendance at the police station. He met him at the applicant's office at World Square. Mr Phillips was accompanied by his mother. Mr Parnell could not remember the purpose of the meeting. He could, however, remember what occurred at the meeting.

64Mr Parnell said (24.8.12, T.281.45) that Mr Phillips asked what his obligations were as the owner of a vehicle if the police wanted to know if he was driving it at a particular time. Mr Parnell explained his obligations under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) and the penalties if he gave false information. Mr Parnell provided him with a photocopy of some sections of LEPRA. Mr Parnell said that he told Mr Phillips ""these are your obligations, tell the truth"". Mr Parnell said that Mr Phillips and his mother left some minutes later. At the time they left he had the understanding that they were going to attend the Quakers Hill Police Station later that afternoon. Mr Parnell denied that Mr Phillips ever produced a statement and that the applicant gave any legal advice during the meeting. Mr Parnell denied that either he or the applicant had asked Mr Phillips to write anything on his hand at that meeting.

65Mr Parnell said that he had appeared for Mr Salim at a couple of adjournments of the proceedings brought against him. There was no mention of Mr Salim in his dealings with Mr Phillips. He was aware that there might have been some connection between them but he could not remember what that connection was. Mr Parnell said that there was no suggestion at any of the meetings with Mr Phillips that he had to act in a particular way so as to protect Mr Salim.

66Mr Parnell was cross-examined by the Crown (27.8.12 - T.293 - T.342). The effect of the cross-examination was that Mr Parnell's description of what had occurred leading up to the attendance by him, Mr Phillips and the applicant at the Quakers Hill Police Station was unbelievable. He was cross-examined to similar effect concerning the second meeting with Mr Phillips.

67The flavour of the cross-examination can be seen from the following:

""Q. ... If you had a client that was going to the police station by an appointment or had been arrested and taken to the police station, it would be normal for a solicitor or a barrister to give some preliminary legal advice to that client. For example in respect to their right to silence or things such as that, do you agree with that?
A. Well depends what you're asked to do.

Q. If you were asked to represent somebody who had been arrested or had an appointment to appear at the police station then that is the type of advice you would be giving that client is that right?
A. If it was sought from you.

Q. Well if somebody retained you that was about to be arrested, or had an appointment at the police station what sort of advice would you be giving them?
A. Well depends what they say to me, you know what the you know.

Q. Well you'd have to get some information off him first wouldn't you about what they were going there for?
A. Yes, yeah. 

Q. What type of matter it was?
A. Well he'd be told that why they were going there.

Q. And who would you expect would tell you that?
A. The client.

Q. Or some other person that was representing them, a solicitor for example?
A. Oh if there was a solicitor yeah, you'd get a short briefing about it from a solicitor.

...

Q. But the relationship generally between the barrister and the solicitor or the clerk is that the - if there is a solicitor and a clerk involved that they would perhaps provide you with some brief information or some information about what the matter is and they would obtain instructions from the client, would you agree with that?
A. Well normally if you're told why, you know, why you're required.

...

Q. You'd be told what type of matter the client was going to be questioned about or charged with, do you agree with that?
A. Generally yeah, yeah.

...


Q. In any event if you're going to the police station to talk about - talk to the police or represent somebody in respect to a particular offence you'd want to know what that offence was, do you agree with that?
A. Look, you act on the request for somebody.

Q. Well if somebody says to you look I want you to come down to the police station and represent me because I'm going to be charged with an offence, you'd want to know what the offence he was going to be charged or he or she was going to be charged with was wouldn't you?
A. If they put it that way yes.

Q. You'd really want to have that information before you went down to the police station wouldn't you?
A. Sometimes I suppose yeah. I mean you can't speak generally about these matters. Every case is an individual case.

Q. Well if a solicitor or somebody rings you up or a clerk or somebody rings you up and says can you come down to the - can you come and meet a client he's going to the police station to be questioned by the police you'd asked wouldn't you what was the charge; it would be the first thing you'd ask?
A. I might yeah, might not.

Q. Are you suggesting that you may not be interested in the charge?
A. It's not a question of me being interested, it's a question of what you're asked to do.

Q. So sir are you suggesting that if somebody rings you up and says look can you come down to the police station I'm going to be charged with something you what, just turn up at the police station and see how it goes, you wouldn't ask?
A. If somebody said I'm going to be charged with something I'd probably ask what it was."" (28.8.12 - T.298.9 - T.301.6)

68Mr Parnell said that there must have been some discussion in the car with Mr Phillips but he could not remember what that was. He remembered that there was some talk about Mr Phillips' employment history but he could not remember much more. He did not recollect any discussion about the reason why Mr Phillips was going to the police station. He did not recollect what, if anything, the applicant told him about why they were going to the police station. Mr Parnell did remember:

""A. Mr Michael contacted me, he said he had - there was a man wanted - was going to - had been requested to go to Quakers Hill Police Station and he expected to be arrested when he got there. He wanted somebody to be present at his interview."" (27.8.12 - T.305.44)

69Mr Parnell said that he could not remember whether the applicant or Mr Phillips provided him with more information about the charge. He did remember that he was not asked to give Mr Phillips any advice as to his rights. In relation to his role at the police station, Mr Parnell said:

""Q. What did you understand your role was going to be at the police station?
A. Be present at any interview that took place.

Q. But for what purpose?
A. Because I'd been requested to be there.

Q. To protect his rights?
A. Nobody said anything about that, no. There's a limit to what you can do when you're present at an interview and you can't hinder the investigation.

Q. No but you can give your client advice as to what his rights are, for example, do you agree with that?
A. If it's requested.

Q. Before you walked into the police station, did you know what the charge was that he was being investigated for?
A. No.

Q. So are you saying that you would go to a police station with a client without knowing what the charge was and without advising him about what his rights were as far as speaking to the police were?
A. Well you might, yeah.

Q. You just present him to the police and just hand him over?
A. Yeah, I act on - I act on requests.

Q. So you, for example, wouldn't think it prudent or necessary to advise a client that, for example, he has a right to silence as far as talking to the police are concerned?
A. Well he mightn't want me to know certain things, the client.

Q. That's not what I'm asking you sir, I'm not asking you whether he wants you to know certain things, I'm asking you whether you would think it be prudent --
A. Well in those circumstances, I wouldn't volunteer anything.

Q. Sir, you'd be just content just to walk into the interview room, sit down with the client and then just find out what it's all about, on the run, so to speak or as it unfolds?
A. Oh yes, yeah, you don't always find out of course what it's about in interviews these days."" (27.8.12 - T.306.36 - T.307.26)

70In further cross-examination Mr Parnell said that he did not remember giving Mr Phillips any advice about his right to silence. He said that at no time did he find out why the police were investigating Mr Phillips. Mr Parnell said:

""Q. Would you agree with this that it's pretty hard to give, almost impossible to give a client legal advice without knowing first of all something about the matter that they - the charge that they're facing?
A. Well it depends what they ask you."" (27.8.12 - T.309)

71Mr Parnell agreed that although he did not know anything about why the police wanted to speak to Mr Phillips, he did advise Mr Phillips to make a statement. He denied that he had ever been shown a statement by Mr Phillips.

72Mr Parnell could not remember what section or sections of LEPRA he photocopied for Mr Phillips. He thought it might have been s14. He agreed that he did not explain the interrelation between s201 and s14 of LEPRA, i.e., the various steps that police had to take before they could rely upon s14. Mr Parnell was not able to say why he did not give such an explanation (27.8.12 - T.337 - 338). He agreed that at no time did he ask Mr Phillips what the serious indictable offence was that the police were investigating which allowed them to activate these powers under LEPRA.

73When it was put to Mr Parnell that the second meeting with Mr Phillips did not take place, he said that it had. Mr Parnell gave evidence that the applicant was a person of good character.

Submissions

74The applicant's primary submission was that the evidence of Mr Phillips was so unreliable that the conviction could not be upheld. 

75The applicant submitted that Mr Phillips' version of events was inherently improbable. The applicant's argument proceeded as follows: Mr Phillips said that he and the applicant had met on four occasions (once with Mr Salim, at the kebab shop, at the police station and outside his office in the city). In relation to the first meeting and the meeting in the kebab shop, Mr Phillips' evidence was that he explained what had happened when he was driving the car on 27 August 2010 in terms which exculpated Mr Salim and himself. Despite this, Mr Phillips said that the applicant told him that this was irrelevant and that he did not need to be told about it. The applicant submitted that if this evidence of Mr Phillips was correct, then he would have known that Mr Phillips' version of events was exculpatory and there was no reason for him to advise that Mr Phillips make a different response when questioned by the police.

76The applicant submitted that the same submission was available in relation to Mr Phillips' evidence concerning the visit to the police station on 19 January 2011. He submitted that the evidence of Mr Phillips concerning that occasion was further weakened by the fact that it was inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Parnell. The applicant submitted that if he and Mr Parnell had been shown a copy of Mr Phillips' statement, as Mr Phillips alleged, it would have been clear to them that the statement was exculpatory of Mr Salim even if it involved some exposure for Mr Phillips. The applicant submitted that if he had in fact been shown the statement, there would have been no reason for him to advise Mr Phillips to say something else to the police when questioned.

77In relation to the fourth meeting in the city, the applicant submitted that the circumstances and date of this meeting were unclear and disputed. Mr Parnell said the meeting took place in the applicant's office, whereas Mr and Mrs Phillips said that it took place in an alleyway next to the city office and that Mr Parnell was not present. Mr Parnell's evidence as to what was said at the meeting differed markedly from that of Mr Phillips and Mrs Phillips, particularly in relation to the words attributed to the applicant which formed the basis of the offence.

78The applicant submitted that whatever might be said about Mr Parnell's evidence, it was highly unlikely that he would be completely mistaken firstly, as to having this meeting with Mr and Mrs Phillips and secondly as to where the meeting took place and finally, as to what was said. The applicant submitted that when one looked at the evidence of Mr Phillips as to what he (the applicant) was alleged to have said, the incongruity of the evidence was clear. Mr Phillips' evidence was:

""We were taken around to the side of the cafe, sat down at a table and the conversation basically started off as in ""I've spoken to John, we've come up with an answer for you to say. That answer is this answer"" and he comes up with ""I don't know what was driving the car on the day"" that ""heaps of people drive my car: friends, family, mother, father etc. Now I can either come down there and say this for you or you can either go down there and say it and save yourself $500."" (22.8.12 - T.115.45 - T.116.4) (emphasis added)

The applicant submitted that according to Mr Phillips at this point in time he (the applicant) knew that Mr Phillips was driving the car on that day. The applicant submitted that it was surprising that there was no discussion about the statement which according to Mr Phillips had been provided to him. Mrs Phillips' evidence was that Mr Phillips told the applicant on that occasion that it was him driving the car ""many times"". The applicant submitted that there would have been no need for Mr Phillips to stress this matter to him in that conversation if, as Mr Phillips asserted, he already knew that fact.

79The applicant submitted that Mr Phillips' evidence concerning the statement was contradictory and contradicted. Mr Phillips was not able to say whether and when the statement was shown to the applicant. Mr Phillips was unable to say that he had provided a copy of the statement to the applicant. Mrs Phillips' evidence was that she thought that she had emailed a copy of the statement to the applicant, but could not recall the date nor could she recall how she had obtained the applicant's email address. The applicant noted that the email was never tendered nor produced during the trial.

80The applicant referred to Mr Phillips' contradictory evidence concerning when this alleged meeting with him in the city took place when Mr Phillips supposedly wrote something on his left hand. The applicant submitted it was not just a question of whether Mr Phillips had confused the meeting with Detective Whale of 31 January with another meeting of 10 February. The applicant noted that according to Mr Phillips' evidence, the crucial meeting was that at which he made a notation on his hands and went to the police station. Mr Phillips' final position was that this had occurred on 10 February. The applicant submitted that this was a fundamental problem in relation to the acceptance of the evidence of both Mr Phillips and Mrs Phillips on this issue.

81The applicant submitted that apart from the unreliability of the evidence of Mr Phillips and Mrs Phillips, there was little evidence from which the jury could infer that he had the requisite intention, i.e., that his intention in telling Mr Phillips to provide incorrect information to the police was to obstruct the prosecution of Mr Salim. The applicant submitted that there was a substantial body of evidence that Mr Phillips was concerned about himself and that even if Mr Phillips' evidence that he (the applicant) had told him to say something to the police in order to mislead them was accepted there was an equally plausible explanation, i.e., that he gave that advice in order to protect Mr Phillips. The applicant submitted that if that alternative explanation was open to the jury to accept, the elements of the offence had not been made out.

82The applicant submitted that all of the evidence of Mrs Phillips supported the alternative explanation, i.e., that if he (the applicant) had given advice to Mr Phillips so as to mislead the police, it was in order to assist Mr Phillips to ensure that he did not get arrested. 

83The applicant submitted that there were further difficulties with the evidence concerning the attendance by Mr Phillips at the Quakers Hill Police Station on 31 January and 10 February 2011. The evidence of Detective Whale as to what was written on Mr Phillips' left hand was different to the evidence of Mr and Mrs Phillips. The recollection of Detective Whale was that Mr Phillips had told him on 31 January that he had come to the police station after receiving legal advice and on 10 February 2011 Detective Whale's understanding was that Mr Phillips had met with his lawyers earlier that morning. Detective Whale later said that he thought it was on 10 February not 31 January 2011 that Mr Phillips had come directly from his lawyers. 

84The applicant noted that in the final address to the jury, the Crown confined its case to the meeting of 31 January 2011 and submitted that it was at that meeting in the city that he had provided the advice to Mr Phillips upon which the offence was based. The applicant submitted that in view of the evidence of Detective Whale there must be real doubt as to whether such a conversation, if it in fact happened, occurred on 31 January 2011. The applicant submitted that it was highly unlikely that Mr Phillips would have been confused on 10 February about whether he had had the meeting with his lawyers earlier that day or 10 or 11 days earlier. This was particularly so when Detective Whale had made no record of the allegations made by Mr Phillips on 31 January 2011, either in the COPS system, or in any other written notes. 

85The applicant submitted that this was not a case to be resolved by issues of credit based on demeanour. He submitted that this Court had no real disadvantage because it did not see the evidence of the witnesses. This was because of the inherent weakness and inconsistencies in the evidence, coupled with the absence of a firm foundation from which to draw the inference of an intention to pervert the course of justice in relation to the prosecution of Mr Salim.

86The applicant summed up his position on the appeal as follows:

(i) The jury could not be satisfied that the applicant was told the true version of events.

(ii) If the applicant was told the true version of events, it was exculpatory. If the applicant was told the true version of events then so too were Mr Salim and Mr Parnell.

(iii) If the applicant was told the true version, it is very unlikely that he would have discouraged Mr Phillips from communicating it to the police, particularly if he (the applicant) was acting in the interests of Mr Salim.

(iv) Mr Parnell's evidence made unlikely the account of the provision of the statement in a motor vehicle on 19 January. It also made unlikely the evidence given by Mr and Mrs Phillips of the meeting of 31 January.

(v) There was an absence of adequate evidence to support the necessary inference that the advice given to Mr Phillips was in the interests of Mr Salim, as opposed to Mr Phillips himself.

(vi) The jury could not be satisfied that the applicant told Mr Phillips to tell a false story to the police and that he did so on 31 January 2011.

(vii) There was a real doubt that any such meeting occurred on 31 January 2011. There was no room for confusion by Mr Phillips about the timing of the critical meeting. This was because of the contemporaneity of the assertions of Detective Whale about it.

Consideration

87The law in relation to the applicant's sole ground of appeal is well settled. The Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s6(1) provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal:

""... shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence ...""

88In M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493 the plurality in the High Court (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ) stated that the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence was:

""7 Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict ... , the question which the
court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 

89Earlier in M, at 492, their Honours said:

""6 ... In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. ... Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand""."" (citations omitted).

90Their Honours added at 494:

""9 ... In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred."" 

91M was approved in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. Their Honours observed that for the purposes of s 6(1) the starting point was that the jury had the primary function in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was integral to that proposition that the jury had seen and heard the witnesses.

92In applying this test, the Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence process as to its sufficiency and its quality. In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) re-affirmed that the test to be applied in determining whether the verdict was unreasonable was that stated in M and MFA.

93In Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559 at [113], Hayne J (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing) said:

""113 It is clear that the evidence that was adduced at the trial did not all point to the appellant's guilt on this first count. But the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard. In the present case, the critical question for the jury was what assessment they made of the whole of the evidence ... That evidence did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt."" (citation omitted)

94Recently the High Court (Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) in BCM v The Queen [2013] HCA 48 said:

""31 The principles to be applied in determining a ground which challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction are well established. They are collected in SKA v The Queen. Prominent in the majority's discussion in SKA of the application of those principles is the requirement that the appellate court's reasons disclose its assessment of the capacity of the evidence to support the verdict. In this case, the obligation was not discharged by observing that the jury was entitled to accept E's evidence and act upon it.""

95Rather than remitting the matter to the relevant Court of Criminal Appeal, their Honours reviewed the evidence at trial and expressed their conclusion as follows:

""47 None of the criticisms of E's evidence discloses inconsistencies of a kind that lead, on a review of the whole of the evidence, to a conclusion that it was not open to the jury to convict. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.""

96An important consideration in the present case is that when deciding upon the whole of the evidence whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty, the Court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or the consideration that the jury had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. The following was said by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA in relation to the determination by an appellate court as to the reasonableness of a jury verdict:

""59 ... involves a function to be performed within a legal system that accords special respect and legitimacy to jury verdicts deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of the accused in serious criminal trials.""

97The applicant has pointed to various inconsistencies and discrepancies in the Crown case. In this regard, the remarks of McHugh J in M at 534 are apposite:

""63 It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness's general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.""

98As was said by Rothman J in Col v R [2013] NSWCCA 302 (in the course of agreeing with Latham J):

""76 I have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. Many cases depend on the jury accepting one version of events and rejecting another; sometimes from one witness. There was a proper basis on which the jury could reject the innocent explanation, and a proper basis for accepting, to the requisite standard, that version, which established guilt.

77 The circumstance that one version in evidence ""is accepted and another ... rejected, of itself, and without independent evidence or some other factor affecting that assessment, cannot be a basis upon which a jury verdict is necessarily rendered unreasonable"": Brendon Singh v R [2011] NSWCCA 100 at [132]. In this case, I agree with the jury's assessment. At the very least, the ""jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving ... [any] ... doubt"" that might otherwise be experienced (M v The Queen, at 494-495). ...""

99These observations concerning the importance of an appellate court recognising the function of the jury and their advantage in assessing witnesses in certain cases are of particular importance here. There can be no doubt that the jury had a considerable advantage over this Court in evaluating the reliability of Mr Phillips, his mother and Detective Whale.

100For the applicant to have been convicted the jury must have rejected the evidence of Mr Parnell. That was a conclusion that was well open to them. Mr Parnell's evidence as to what happened leading up to his attendance at the Quakers Hill Police Station on 19 January 2011 was incredible. It is difficult to accept that a barrister of his experience would have made no inquiries and proffered no advice concerning Mr Phillips' attendance. Most surprising is his willingness to allow Mr Phillips to be spoken to by the investigating police officer out of his hearing. Since he was already acting for Mr Salim, his lack of interest in the connection between Mr Salim and Mr Phillips is not only surprising but strains credulity.

101Similar comments can be made about his evidence concerning the second meeting with Mr Phillips. Not only is that meeting (or at least his attendance at it) disputed by Mr and Mrs Phillips, but his evidence as to what occurred also strains credulity. It is difficult to understand why he would provide a printout of part of LEPRA without knowing what charges Mr Phillips might be facing and without making any inquiries on that issue. It is also surprising that he would not have pointed out, at least in outline, the requirements which investigating police had to meet before being able to rely upon s 14 LEPRA.

102Not only was it open to the jury to reject the evidence of Mr Parnell, it would have verged on the unreasonable for them not to have done so. It follows that the evidence in the Crown case has to be evaluated without taking into account the contrary evidence of Mr Parnell.

103If the evidence of Mr Phillips was the only evidence in the Crown case, the criticisms levelled by the applicant would have considerable force. It is clear that Mr Phillips' recollection as to dates and detail is poor. If his was the only evidence as to the conversation with the applicant on 31 January 2011 upon which the offence is based, there might well be a question mark as to whether it was open to the jury to convict. However, his evidence as to the events of that day is corroborated to a significant degree by his mother and to a lesser degree by Detective Whale. There is also an internal consistency in the evidence of Mr Phillips i.e., his desire to tell what happened (and his evidence as to that has never altered) which was initially met by a lack of interest on the part of the applicant and later advice not to provide that version of events to the police.

104Mr Phillips gave evidence as to a first meeting with the applicant in the presence of Mr Salim. There is no evidence to the effect that this meeting did not take place. Mr Salim was not called, nor did the applicant give evidence to that effect. At trial the challenge to Mr Phillips' evidence about the first meeting was that he had not told the police about it. While there was no evidence in terms that he told his mother about the meeting, it is clear from her evidence that she was aware that he had met the applicant before he attended the police station on 19 January. The principal attack on his evidence is not one which was made at trial but on the appeal, i.e., the inherent improbability of him having told the applicant what had happened in the same or similar terms as that set out in his statement.

105In relation to the meeting with the applicant at the kebab shop, this is confirmed by Mrs Phillips. Mrs Phillips was cross-examined as to an inconsistency between the time given by Mr Phillips for the meeting and that given by her. Apart from the inherent improbability submission, this is the major challenge to his evidence concerning that meeting. Her evidence is also supportive of Mr Phillips having prepared the statement which became Exhibit A. There was no evidence to the effect that the meeting at the kebab shop did not take place.

106Nothing much turns on the police station visit on 19 January 2011. Its importance is that to which I have already referred, i.e., the extent to which it places doubt on the evidence of Mr Parnell. The same attack is made on Mr Phillips' evidence in relation to that attendance, as is made with respect to the first two meetings with the applicant. In relation to the attendance at the police station, however, there is confirmatory evidence from Detective Whale. Although his evidence is restricted to what happened at the police station, it is consistent with the evidence of Mr Phillips.

107The meeting with the applicant on 31 January is fundamental to the Crown case. The applicant submits that because of Mr Phillips' confusion as to the dates on which he attended the police station, and the evidence of Detective Whale as to Mr Phillips saying he had sought legal advice before attending the police station on 10 February, there is considerable doubt as to whether any such meeting took place on 31 January.

108There is no evidence, other than that of Mr Parnell, that a meeting between the applicant and Mr Phillips as described by Mr Phillips did not take place on 31 January. There is a substantial body of evidence to the effect that it did. The evidence of Mrs Phillips fully corroborates that such a meeting took place. The evidence of Detective Whale is consistent with such a meeting. Detective Whale's observation of writing on Mr Phillips' left hand is an important corroborative detail. There is also the evidence given by Detective Whale concerning the meeting on 31 January [at [13] hereof] where he said:

""A. Mr Phillips went on to tell me that he'd just come from seeking legal advice. He told me that he was told to say certain things. He also told me that he had further evidence that he could get hold of in the form of documents that would show that he was innocent of any crime in relation to the Marwan Salim matter and that he had a witness who would provide evidence in the form of a statement, again in relation to the Marwan Salim matter."" (21.8.12 - T.12.11)

109There was no issue that Mr Phillips attended the police station on 31 January and 10 February. It is equally clear that Mr Phillips in his evidence was confused as to dates and elided the two visits into one. Detective Whale's evidence as to what he was told on 31 January and as to what happened, was corroborated by the events of 10 February. Not only did Mr Phillips tell him that he had a statement and a witness but on 10 February Mr Phillips provided a statement and Mr Kewin to Detective Whale. This is despite the fact that Detective Whale in part of his evidence is confused as to what he was told by Mr Phillips on 10 February.

110I have already adverted to the importance of the evidence as to the writing on Mr Phillips' hand. That was taken up in cross-examination of Detective Whale:

""Q. Now Detective I think I may have already suggested this to you before lunch but I just want to make it very clear. Is there some confusion in your mind about what was said on 31 January 2011 compared to 10 February 2011?
A. There is something, having thought about when we were talking about the writing on the hand. The writing on the hand was the day he went and saw and sought legal advice. 

Q. And which day is that?
A. That would be 31st as opposed to the 10th."" (22.8.12 - T.83.40)

111The applicant submitted that Detective Whale's evidence concerning the writing on Mr Phillips' hand was unreliable because his description of what was written on the left hand was different to that given by Mrs Phillips and Mr Phillips. There is little substance in that submission. Detective Whale never said that he read what was on the hand. The importance of his evidence was that something was written on the hand and it was by reference to that unusual fact that he was able to identify 31 January as the relevant date. In any event, his impression as to the effect of what was written on the hand is generally consistent with the evidence of Mr Phillips and his mother.

112Mrs Phillips' evidence as to what happened at the police station on 31 January fits neatly with the evidence of Detective Whale. It is also consistent with her evidence as to what happened earlier that day at the meeting with the applicant. It is the evidence of Mrs Phillips as to this meeting with the applicant which is particularly persuasive. That evidence has been set out in the reasons.

113Having fully reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that although there were inconsistencies in the Crown case, they were not of a kind that would lead to a conclusion that it was not open to the jury to find that the words attributed to the applicant by Mr Phillips and Mrs Phillips were said by the applicant on 31 January 2011 when he met with them.

114I have not, at this stage, said anything about the applicant's submission that there was an absence of evidence to support the necessary inference that the advice given to Mr Phillips was in the interests of Mr Salim, as distinct from Mr Phillips himself.

115The Crown was not required to prove that the words said were in the interests of Mr Salim, merely that they were intended to pervert the course of justice, being the prosecution of Mr Salim. There can be no doubt and there does not appear to be an issue, that if the applicant did tell Mr Phillips to lie to the police about his knowledge of who was driving the car on 27 August 2010, it had the capacity to obstruct or hinder the police investigation into Mr Salim.

116In any event, the overall context in which the words were said established that proposition. The applicant and Mr Parnell were acting for Mr Salim. One of Mrs Phillips' criticisms of the applicant was that he appeared to only be interested in Mr Salim and not to have any interest in the position of Mr Phillips. When Detective Whale first contacted Mr Phillips, he told him that it was ""to do with the crime of Marwan Salim"" (22.8.10 - T.103.25, T.110.20). Mr Phillips first contacted the applicant through Mr Salim. Even after the first visit to the police station, Mr Phillips did not have the applicant's telephone number and when he needed to contact him he did so through Mr Salim (22.8.12 - T.112.25).

117In that regard, it does not assist the applicant to argue that if he did give the impugned advice to Mr Phillips, it was more in Mr Phillips' interests than Mr Salim's. This is because the applicant acted for Mr Salim and he told Mr Phillips to lie to police who were investigating the kidnapping charges against Mr Salim. Such misleading information, if communicated to the police, had the capacity to obstruct the investigation and possible prosecution of Mr Salim, a matter about which the applicant would have been well aware.

118I am satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the inference that the applicant told Mr Phillips to lie in order to obstruct the course of justice, namely the investigation and possible prosecution of Mr Salim. 

119It follows that it was open to the jury, on the whole of the evidence, to reach that conclusion.

120It follows from the above analysis that none of the criticisms of the evidence of Mr Phillips, Mrs Phillips and Detective Whale demonstrates inconsistencies of a kind that lead, on a review of the whole of the evidence, to a conclusion that it was not open to the jury to convict. That is the conclusion which I have reached having fully reviewed the evidence.

121The order which I propose is that in relation to the conviction appeal, leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

Application for Leave to Appeal against Sentence

122On 29 August 2012 following a six day trial, the applicant was found guilty of one count of doing an act with the intention of perverting the course of justice, contrary to s319 Crimes Act 1900. The offence has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. There was no standard non-parole period.

123Proceedings on sentence commenced 19 December 2012 and concluded on 21 March 2013. On that date, Payne DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 months and a balance of term of 12 months.

124The applicant remained on bail from the time of his conviction on 29 August 2012 until he was sentenced on 21 March 2013. On 26 June 2013 the applicant was granted bail by Slattery J and was released on that day. He has served 3 months and 6 days of the sentence imposed by Payne DCJ.

125The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal in relation to sentence.

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant's conduct had the potential to either defeat or thwart the prosecution of Salim.

Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extra curial punishment suffered by the applicant.

Ground 3 - Her Honour erred in finding that the offence was a serious example of an offence against s319 Crimes Act 1900.

Ground 4 - Her Honour erred in concluding that a sentence of fulltime imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence.

Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Sentence Proceedings

126The sentencing judge identified the lie which the applicant advised Mr Phillips to tell the police as ""Mr Phillips did not know who was driving the car at a time when Mr Marwan Salim was alleged to have been in the car and involved in an offence of detain for advantage"". Her Honour went on to say:

""The effect of Mr Phillips not being able to identify the driver (and consequentially the passengers) of his vehicle on the relevant day would be to weaken the case against Marwan Salim."" (ROS 2.5)

Her Honour was not prepared to find that the applicant had held himself out to be a solicitor, but did find that he:

""... held himself out as the legal representative of Marwan Salim, and also held himself out as a person who could provide legal advice to Daniel Phillips as a legal clerk or paralegal. ... To that extent he was working within the criminal justice system"". (ROS 2.7)

127Her Honour found the following twelve facts established:

(i) On 27 August 2010 the alleged offence involving Mr Marwan Salim occurred.

(ii) On 28 August 2010 Marwan Salim was charged with detain for advantage. The alleged victim was Robert Rad. Detective Whale spoke to the applicant by telephone who identified himself as Salim's representative.

(iii) About September 2010 Salim and Mr Phillips met with the applicant in his city office. On that occasion, Mr Phillips told the applicant that he was driving his car and that Salim was with him at the time of the offence.

(iv) In September 2010 Mr Phillips was identified by police as a suspect in the detain for advantage of Mr Rad. Police commenced lawfully intercepting his telephone conversations.

(v) On 17 January 2011 Detective Whale contacted Mr Phillips and asked him to attend the Quakers Hill Police Station.

(vi) On 19 January 2011 Mr Phillips met Mr Parnell and the applicant at the Blacktown Railway Station. Mr Phillips gave the applicant some money ($300 or $500). Mr Phillips then drove them to the Quakers Hill Railway Station where he handed the applicant a statement which he had prepared. The applicant and Mr Parnell both read the statement. All three then attended the Quakers Hill Police Station. They met with Detective Whale at the front desk where it was indicated that Mr Phillips would not be participating in an interview.

(vii) In January 2011 Detective Whale spoke to Mr Phillips by telephone and arranged for him to attend the police station on 28 January 2011 to provide information as to who was driving his car on 27 August 2010.

(viii) In January 2011 Mr Phillips, his mother and Mr Salim met with the applicant at a kebab shop in Casula late in the evening. Mr Phillips and his mother discussed the matter with the applicant.

(ix) On 28 January 2011 the applicant contacted Detective Whale and advised him that he and his client were unable to attend that day and arrangements were made for Mr Phillips to attend the police station on 31 January 2011.

(x) On 31 January 2011 Mr Phillips and his mother met with the applicant at a cafe in an ""alleyway"" underneath World Square in Sydney. The applicant advised Mr Phillips to tell the police that he could not recall who was driving his car on the day and to say that other people, including his father, mother, sister and friends, drove his car from time to time. The applicant coached and rehearsed Mr Phillips in what he was to say to the police. The applicant advised Mr Phillips to write what he needed to say on his hand so he would remember it. Subsequently, Mr Phillips and his mother met with Detective Whale at the Quakers Hill Police Station. Mr Phillips was unable to recall what it was he was meant to tell the police and told Detective Whale that he had wanted to come to the police and tell the truth but that the applicant had counselled and advised him not to.

(xi) On 10 February 2011 Mr Phillips and his mother attended Quakers Hill Police Station and provided statements.

(xii) On 13 October 2011 the applicant was charged in relation to this matter.

128The sentencing judge assessed the objective gravity of the offence. She found that there was a degree of premeditation on the part of the applicant. She noted that offences of this kind struck at the very heart of the justice system and that accordingly it was necessary for the courts to give a clear message by way of deterrence to others who might contemplate committing such an offence. She noted that denunciation was a significant feature of the sentencing exercise. She had regard to the high maximum penalty as being a guidepost and as recognising the importance of protecting the integrity of the criminal justice system. 

129It was in that context that her Honour said:

""I accept the following taken from the Crown's submissions:
In this case, the conduct of the prisoner had the potential to either defeat or thwart the prosecution of Marwan Salim. It is not relevant to sentencing, nor does it affect the gravity of the offence, that the prosecution of Marwan Salim was eventually discontinued. The gravamen of the offence is the intention that the course of justice be perverted and the undermining of confidence in the criminal justice system. Similarly, the fact that an attempt to pervert the course of justice did not succeed, or was never likely to succeed, is of lesser significance than in attempts to commit other types of offences."" (ROS 5.7 - 6.1)

130Her Honour accepted that the fact that the applicant may not have stood to directly benefit financially from his actions was not of significance. She found that the fact that the applicant was acting as a legal representative elevated the gravity of the offence. On that issue, her Honour relied on R v Pangallo [1991] 56 A Crim R 441 where Lee CJ at CL said at 443 - 444:

""The police are in constant contact with members of the legal profession, both barristers and solicitors, and the opportunities for bribery are great and those circumstances of themselves mean that the element of deterrence is always a matter which must be kept very much to the forefront of the mind of a sentencing judge when a solicitor appears before him on a charge such as the present one. Solicitors, as part of the legal profession, are expected to conduct themselves towards their clients with honesty and that high standard of honesty is also expected of them in their dealings with the police, the courts and indeed also with other public authorities.""

Her Honour noted her previous finding that he was not acting as a solicitor but was acting within the criminal justice system.

131Despite the fact that unlike a barrister or solicitor, the applicant as a law clerk had not taken an oath or an affirmation as to his integrity, her Honour noted that the applicant still worked within the administration of justice sphere and that is where the seriousness of the offence lay. Her Honour noted that the advice given by him to Mr Phillips assumed that he had the relevant knowledge to give the advice. Her Honour's conclusion as to the seriousness of the offence was:

""In my view, even though the prisoner was not admitted to practice, the offence, given all of the circumstances as noted in (i) to (xii) above, make this a serious example of an offence contrary to s319. As I have already said, he was clearly working within the criminal justice system. In my view, this elevates the gravity of the offence. What he did involved significant criminal culpability. I say this despite there being no threats and no coercion, a feature relied upon by defence counsel."" (ROS 8.2)

132The applicant had a strong subjective case. He was born in 1984, was 26 at the time of the offence and 28 at the time of sentence. He had no criminal record. He was the second oldest of six children born in Australia to Lebanese parents.

133The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and character evidence was given by Mr Coleman, a semi-retired barrister, a friend Mr Marin and his older brother, Laurence. Mr Parnell had given character evidence at the trial. There was also available to the sentencing judge a pre-sentence report dated 11 October 2012 and a psychological report of Mr Probets. 

134The psychological report and the evidence from the applicant and his brother made it clear that the applicant came from a difficult family background. His father's family had been very antagonistic towards his mother and this antagonism was taken out on the children including the applicant. The antagonism included physical assaults. This was exacerbated by the fact that during the applicant's childhood up to 40 people were living in a two-storey house at Moorebank. 

135Those early years involved a shortage of food for the children. Living conditions were extremely harsh. His parents' marriage broke up and his mother struggled to raise the children. As a result the applicant was required to work outside of school hours to assist in the support of the family. At school the applicant had experienced difficulties because of a stutter which he had developed. Despite these hardships, the applicant had a close relationship with his mother and siblings. He was estranged from his father.

136While the hearing of this charge was pending, the applicant married in November 2011. Initially he kept the fact of the charge from his wife to protect her. At the time of sentence his wife was very supportive of him. Her Honour noted that the character witnesses spoke very highly of the applicant, as did his older brother.

137In relation to the applicant's studies, her Honour found:

""He was, despite his circumstances, able to complete the Higher School Certificate in 2002. He has no university qualifications. Despite this, he has a considerable HECS debt. He was proceeding with the requirements of the Legal Practitioners Admission Board. His evidence was, and the pre-sentence report noted, he had expected to finish his last semester of study, one subject (two examinations), and the College of Law at the end of 2012 and be admitted. This did not happen, he said, because of the injury to his finger and his bail conditions. ... He will, as a result of the conviction, be unable to pursue further a career in the law. The psychological report notes at p 2 of 11, para [1]:

""He stated he has been employed for the past seven years as a law clerk including for about five years for a barrister named John Parnell.""

It seems from the evidence given by the prisoner his legal studies extended over a period of in the order of eight or nine years. Even though he had still not, as at late 2012, completed all requirements.""

138Her Honour found that he was a person of good character and that he was unlikely to require supervision on release. The psychologist's report indicated that he did not require psychological treatment. Her Honour found reasonably good prospects for rehabilitation.

139A matter which was raised before her Honour was an injury which the applicant had suffered to his right, little finger. This was relevant in two respects. Time was needed for the finger to recover which was unlikely to occur if he were sent to prison and his time in custody would be more difficult because of his inability to properly use his right hand and if necessary, defend himself while in prison. There was evidence before her Honour as to the medical assistance available for the applicant in prison. Her Honour found that in addition to his finger his conditions of custody would be more onerous because of the effect which he knew it would have upon his wife and mother.

140Her Honour concluded her remarks as follows:

""The Court in every case must bear in mind the maximum penalty prescribed and the particular facts and circumstances, both objective and subjective, of the case, and the requirement for general deterrence. Weighing those considerations, in my view, nothing other than a full-time custodial sentence is appropriate in this case.""

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in finding that the applicant's conduct had the potential to either defeat or thwart the prosecution of Salim.

141This ground of appeal challenges the finding by her Honour which is set out at [129] hereof. The applicant submitted that given the nature of the evidence which Mr Phillips was able to give concerning the incident on 27 August 2010, it was simply not open to her Honour to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the interference with the police investigation intended by the applicant would have the effect of potentially defeating or thwarting the prosecution case against Mr Salim.

142This was because there was nothing that Mr Phillips had to say about the events on that day that could have assisted the prosecution case, (so far as we understand it), against Mr Salim. The opposite situation actually existed in that Mr Phillips' account was likely to exculpate Mr Salim. On that basis, the applicant submitted that it was an error for her Honour to conclude as she did that the applicant's conduct had the potential to either defeat or thwart the prosecution of Salim.

143The respondent submitted that in effect this submission sought to traverse the correctness of the jury's verdict and was misconceived. I do not agree. I have concluded that there is substance in the complaint made by the applicant that her Honour was not entitled to make such a finding beyond reasonable doubt. The more important question, however, is what effect, if any, that incorrect finding had on sentence.

144What is clear is that if Mr Phillips had lied to the police as advised by the applicant, that false information had the potential to obstruct the investigation into the activities of Mr Salim. Moreover, the applicant intended that it should do so. That is the nub of the offence. As her Honour pointed out in the same paragraph which contains the disputed finding of fact, ""The gravamen of the offence is the intention that the course of justice be perverted and the undermining of confidence in the criminal justice system"". As her Honour also noted, it mattered not that the prosecution of Mr Salim was eventually discontinued (R v Marinellis [2001] NSWCCA 328 at [38] ff.)

145While I agree that it was not open to her Honour to make the impugned finding of fact the error led nowhere. It was an incidental finding made by her Honour when she adopted the Crown submissions on that issue. It did not affect the other matters which her Honour properly took into account as relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.

146As Latham J said in Baxter v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing):

""83 An error is a ""material error"" if it has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, regardless of whether it can be demonstrated that the error has in fact influenced the sentencing outcome. It is an error in the House v The King sense because the sentencing judge has taken into account an erroneous or irrelevant consideration. However, the error must be more than ""trivial or immaterial"".""

147Not only did the error not in fact influence the sentencing outcome, its capacity to do so was minimal. It can be correctly characterised as being no more than ""trivial or immaterial"". As can be seen from the review of her Honour's reasons, the precise content of the advice was immaterial. What was important was its potential effect on the criminal justice system and the applicant's intent in providing the advice.

148Accordingly, although the error identified in the ground of appeal has been made out, it was not a ""material error"" and did not in fact or potentially affect the sentence imposed.

Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in not properly taking into account the extra curial punishment suffered by the applicant.

149The applicant submitted that the loss of his legal career was a substantial punishment. This was particularly so when he had been studying for 8-9 years and was very close to being admitted as a legal practitioner. He submitted that the loss was all the greater because of the background of disadvantage which he had to overcome. The loss was significant because he was a young person just about to start on a legal career which he could reasonably anticipate was going to last for many years into the future.

150The applicant submitted that although her Honour had referred to this fact, there was no suggestion in her remarks on sentence that this feature of the case was taken into account as a matter in mitigation of sentence. The applicant submitted that had this matter been properly taken into account with other mitigating factors, it should have had a significant effect on the sentence imposed.

151I am not persuaded that her Honour did fail to take this matter into account as a matter in mitigation of sentence. Her Honour's references to this subject are set out at [137] hereof. It is clear that her Honour regarded this as a matter of importance otherwise she would not have dealt with it in such detail. Her Honour's remarks on this subject came under the heading ""Defence Submissions and Subjective Matters"" which included matters of mitigation. All the applicant's mitigating considerations were set out under that heading. 

152A similar complaint was made in a similar case of Oudomvilay v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 275 where Hidden J (with whom Giles JA and Grove J agreed) said:

""18 Mr Corish submitted that her Honour had failed to take into account as a mitigating factor the fact that the applicant had been struck off the roll of solicitors. Her Honour referred to that matter when summarising the subjective case, noting that she had ""lost her right, indeed privilege, to be a solicitor"". Her Honour did not mention the matter again and Mr Corish argued that, from the fact that it was not specifically referred to as a mitigating factor, it should be inferred that it was not taken into account as such. He submitted that it should have been, as it amounted to a form of extra curial punishment. He referred to R v Daetz & Anor (2003) 139 A Crim R 398, particularly per James J at [61]-[63].

19 Before outlining the applicant's subjective case, her Honour had set out the applicable mitigating factors under s21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These included her plea of guilty and her prior good character, and her Honour's finding that she had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. Extra curial punishment is not one of the mitigating factors set out in subs (3). No doubt, that is why her Honour referred a little later to the applicant's loss of her career as a solicitor. It was in the context of her Honour's assessment of the deleterious effects upon the applicant of the offences, including her loss of standing in her community and the compromise of her relationship with members of her extended family.

20 It was appropriate for her Honour to have regard to all those matters in mitigation of sentence and, clearly, it was for that purpose that she referred to them. ...""

153It should be noted that in the sentence proceedings the applicant made no submissions as to extra curial punishment. In the absence of any specific submission it would have been appropriate for her Honour to deal with this circumstance of mitigation concisely. In fact her Honour, given the overall brevity of her remarks on sentence, devoted considerable space to this consideration.

154I have concluded that her Honour did take this matter into account and treated it as an important consideration. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 3 - Her Honour erred in finding that the offence was a serious example of an offence against s319 Crimes Act 1900.

Ground 4 - Her Honour erred in concluding that a sentence of fulltime imprisonment was the only appropriate sentence.

Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly excessive.

155Since these grounds of appeal raise essentially the same issue, they can conveniently be dealt with together.

156The applicant submitted that it was not open to her Honour to find that ""this is a serious example of an offence contrary to s 319"". In oral submissions the applicant submitted that a better characterisation of what occurred was ""a completely misguided and misconceived piece of bad fumbling by a legal clerk who shouldn't have been doing any of these things at all"" (Appeal Transcript 8.46).

157The applicant submitted that there were a number of aspects of this case which reduced its seriousness. The applicant submitted that he was a legal clerk at the time, lacking both knowledge and practical experience. He submitted that this was evident from him being in contact with Mr Phillips at all, given that he had a role in the representation of Mr Salim. The applicant submitted that another indicia of his lack of practical experience was his failure to recognise that Mr Phillips' version of events exculpated rather than incriminated Mr Salim. 

158The applicant submitted that these surrounding circumstances are important when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. In that regard, the applicant referred to Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; 200 A Crim R 1 where Basten JA considered that the offence of making a statement with intent to pervert the course of justice in that instance was made more serious because it occurred after the offender had perjured himself in the Local Court and that by reason of his career in legal practice as a judge and lawyer, he must have fully appreciated the seriousness of the offence.

159The applicant submitted that by reference to such more serious cases it could be seen that this was a comparatively minor example of such an offence. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, a sentence short of fulltime imprisonment was appropriate and her Honour should have so found. The applicant submitted that there were good reasons to conclude that the objective seriousness of the offence was towards the lower end of the range. This was particularly so when account was taken of the applicant's subjective case. The applicant submitted that imprisonment was a sentence of last resort and that her Honour should have considered all other possible alternatives before imposing a custodial sentence.

160The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence was a discretionary exercise by her Honour. Such an evaluation is classically within the role of the sentencing judge. This Court has said on a number of occasions that it would be slow to set aside the determination of objective seriousness made by a primary judge (R v Mulato [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] per Spigelman CJ; Marracos v R [2008] NSWCCA 267 at [18] per Hislop J; R v Mercael [2010] NSWCCA 36 at [85] per James J).

161Her Honour's finding that the offence was a serious example of an offence contrary to s 319 was based upon her Honour's twelve factual findings, none of which were challenged by the applicant. Her Honour noted (correctly) that the gravity of the offence was increased by reason of the applicant being a person acting within the criminal justice system, albeit that he was a law clerk not a qualified practitioner. In that regard, however, it should not be ignored that the evidence was that he had considerable practical experience of somewhere between 6 and 7 years.

162As her Honour appreciated, the maximum sentence for an offence contrary to s319 of the Crimes Act was an important guidepost. Here the maximum penalty is 14 years. The sentence actually imposed was 2 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months. It is clear from the sentence itself that her Honour was conscious of the very matters to which the applicant refers, including his strong subjective case and took them into account. This is why the sentence ultimately imposed can be appropriately characterised as modest. Given the seriousness of any offence contrary to s 319 Crimes Act, it is not without significance that the head sentence was less than 20 percent of the maximum sentence and the non-parole period was 55 percent of the head sentence. The length of the head sentence suggests that her Honour did in fact treat the offence as one that fell towards the lower end of the range. 

163The submission that her Honour erred in failing to consider alternatives to fulltime custody should be rejected. Her Honour held that weighing the objective facts with the applicant's subjective case, bearing in mind the maximum penalty and the need for general deterrence, nothing other than a fulltime custodial sentence was warranted. In doing so, her Honour noted that denunciation and deterrence were entitled to greater weight for this kind of offence (Nguyen v R [2004] NSWCCA 332; 149 A Crim R 343 at [43]).

164Her Honour's findings in relation to a custodial penalty were consistent with the statement of principle of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Studdert J agreed) in Marinellis at [42] to the effect that the appropriate sentence for an offence contrary to s 319 would normally involve a period of fulltime custody.

165A similar ground of appeal was considered and rejected in Hardie v Regina; Phillipsen v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 6 where RS Hulme J (with whom Basten JA and Schmidt J agreed), after referring to the judgment of Howie J in Zamagias v R [2002] NSWCCA 17, said:

""16 It may be accepted that Howie J's remarks accurately and logically reflect the various steps and the order of them as flow from the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, it does not follow that a judge must expressly follow this order and refer to all of the steps in circumstances where the ultimate result is, in the judge's view, clear. Howie J made this clear at [30] of his remarks in the case just referred to. Basten JA made a similar point when, in Amado v R (2011) NSWCCA 197 at 5, his Honour observed:- 


""It was unrealistic to suppose that the Court actually reaches its conclusion by proceeding mechanically from step one to step three.""

17 Certainly, in many cases the risk of error may increase if a judge does not expressly advert to some or all of the possibilities or steps referred to in Howie J's remarks. But there are many cases where a sentence of full-time imprisonment is so obviously demanded that the procedure envisaged by Howie J can properly be foregone.""

166Her Honour's conclusion that nothing other than a fulltime custodial sentence was warranted was supported by her Honour's findings as to objective gravity and the need for deterrence and denunciation. Accordingly, it was not necessary for her Honour to advert to each of the alternatives to fulltime custody. The applicant has failed to demonstrate error and ground 4 should be dismissed.

167To succeed on ground 5, the applicant must satisfy the Court that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the well recognised sense that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371, Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9]. It is not sufficient that this Court might be of the view that, had it been sentencing the applicant, it might have exercised its discretion differently to that of the sentencing judge. Intervention is warranted only where error is demonstrated in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505. Such error has not been demonstrated.

168Ground 5 should be dismissed.

169As already indicated, the applicant was sentenced on 21 March 2013 and granted bail on 26 June 2013, having served 3 months and 6 days of the sentence imposed by her Honour. Since the appeal has been dismissed, the applicant's bail should be revoked and he should be returned to custody to serve the balance of the sentence imposed on 21 March 2013. Allowing for the time already served, the applicant's non-parole period of imprisonment will expire on 30 January 2015 and the balance of his term on 29 January 2016.

170The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Leave to appeal against conviction and sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

(2) The applicant's bail be revoked forthwith.

(3) The applicant be returned to custody on 5 February 2014 so that his non-parole period of imprisonment will expire on 30 January 2015 and the balance of his term will expire on 29 January 2016.

171BLANCH J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL and the orders proposed. 

172PRICE J: Having myself assessed the whole of the evidence, I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offence contrary to 
s 319 of the Crimes Act. I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders that are proposed. I also agree that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

2763203,R v Sopronick [2014] NSWDC 12,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Judges have to sentence offenders for their involvement in a wide variety of illegal drugs. Not all of those drugs are equal in the harm that they cause to the users of them, but rarely is there ever evidence put before a judge which would enable an informed decision to be made as to whether one particular drug causes more harm than another. In any case, authority in New South Wales suggests that Parliament has decided how serious various drugs are by attributing particular quantities to them in appropriate legislation.

2In this case the offender is to be sentenced for attempting to possess more than seven kilograms of a drug known Gamma-butyrolactone, more commonly known as GBL, in circumstances where the commercial quantity of that drug is one kilogram. Attempting to possess the commercial quantity exposes the offender to life imprisonment. So looking only at the quantity which the offender attempted to possess and the definition of the commercial quantity of that drug the offender's criminality was of high order.

3But there is another factor, which it is agreed between the Crown and Mr Bowe who appears for the accused, that I need to take into account. I was asked to take into account that the street value of the drugs which the offender attempted to possess was between $32,850 and $43,800. To put that into context a street value of seven kilograms of cocaine or heroin would have been in the millions. So in assessing the offender's criminality I will take into account a number of factors, including that there was seven times the commercial quantity involved, and that the street value of the drugs was in comparison to many other narcotic substances relatively low.

4The offender knew a man who has not been named in court and to whom we have referred as Mr X. The offender, who is gay, was a very close friend of Mr X. He enjoyed his company and regarded him as a good looking, successful, caring and honest man. Mr X was a user of GHB, a drug treated identically to GBL, the relevant drug in this case. In that regard Mr X was doing something which is quite common in a gay community using GHB for recreational purposes. The offender too was a user of that drug. So when Mr X asked the offender to take delivery of a package, for no financial award to the offender, he agreed, despite suspecting, to what must have been a level approaching certainty, that the package contained drugs.

5So it was that on 3 January 2013 Customs were able to intercept a package containing approximately 7.3 litres of GBL addressed to a Benjamin Slater at the offender's address. Testing revealed that there were drugs contained within the package and these were replaced with an inert substance. That explains why the charge that Mr Sopronick faces is one of attempt. 

6The package was given to a police officer who, pretending to be a UPS courier driver, tried to deliver the package. No one was home the first time the driver went, so a delivery slip was left with a telephone number for the consignee to ring. Shortly afterwards someone who identified himself as ""Ben"" rang the driver. This was the offender contacting the driver, who returned to the premises and gave the package to the offender. There was a listening device within the package and what could be heard thereafter was the package being opened and moved. After that the offender went out to dinner. When he came back police knocked on the door. Fearing detection the offender threw the consignment out the window. Police entered the premises and arrested the accused and seized the damaged packages from the street.

7It is the offender's case that he was acting for his friend, not for any payment, and that his role was simply to receive the package and hand it over to either Mr X or someone nominated by him. Police obviously intervened before that could occur. There is no evidence to suggest what the offender said was inaccurate. I will accept that he has demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that his role was limited to that which I have described. 

8It is important to remember that this was not an isolated incident. The offender faces no charges in relation to any prior importations, but admitted in evidence that he had done something similar a few times before. Of course he is not to be sentenced for offences with which he has not been charged, but in those circumstances he is not entitled to say that this was the only time that he had acted this way. A leniency that he would otherwise be entitled to is denied him.

9The offender gave evidence as to his life. It is clear that he is incredibly hard working and industrious, and before his arrest was in an occupation that he enjoyed. He was entitled to be proud of his success in achieving that position through the hard work that he had put in, including studying. He accepts that he only has himself to blame for the position he now finds himself in, in gaol with a prospect of him remaining there for some time to come.

10The offender has one prior conviction for drug possession but gave evidence that he had been using drugs well beyond that. It seems to me that drug use was so common in the circles in which the offender mixed that he had a distorted view as to the seriousness of drug use and drug possession. Since going into custody no drugs have been detected in his system, apart from a dirty urine analysis as to which was done very soon after he entered into custody and which probably resulted from drug consumption before his arrest.

11I accept that the offender is remorseful for what he has done. Perhaps the best evidence of that comes from something that I will speak about with some circumspection. He has spoken to police in an effort to assist them. The value of that assistance was not high, but it appears that the offender has done what he could. That is of relevance of course to any discount for assistance, but also assists in the demonstration of remorse. 

12The offender entered a plea of guilty to this matter at what was a fairly late stage and so in order to reflect his willingness to facilitate the course of justice and also to reflect his assistance I will impose a sentence upon him which is about 15% less than it would otherwise have been.

13This is a case where the offender was, in effect, taken advantage of. Mr X needed some way of getting GBL into the country in a way that reduced the risk that he would be detected as a drug importer. It was he who took advantage of Mr Sopronick's friendship with him. Mr Sopronick was foolish in the extreme to do what was asked of him because, as he well knew at the time, what he was doing was involving himself in something that was almost certainly a serious criminal offence. 

14The Crown handed up a schedule of what it said were comparative cases. It revealed a wide disparity in sentences imposed in various courts across the country for offences related to GBL or GHB. I have to say that I do not recall any other offence where there is such a variation in sentencing. This of course has made my job harder. The comparative cases have been of little assistance. I have approached this matter taking into account the maximum penalty, the quantity involved, the offender's role, the value of the drugs and the offender's subjective circumstances in deciding the appropriate sentence.

15I have also had to make a decision as to the non-parole period. Under Commonwealth law it use to be the case that there was what was described as a ""norm"" that the non-parole period would usually be 60 to 66% of the head sentence. The High Court has relatively recently held that there is no such norm. There is a tendency on the part of the judicial officers, despite that decision, to continue to do something similar to what they had been doing before.

16 I prefer to consider what was happening before what was said to be the norm was introduced, and before in State law statutory ratios were introduced. In those days the non-parole period was often in the order of 40% of the head sentence. I consider that current sentencing for Commonwealth offences would often see a non-parole period of that proportion imposed, and so it will be in this case. The non-parole period reflects the minimum period that I consider the offender should spend in custody given all the circumstances of this case.

17The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 22/01/13 and a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period will expire on 21/01/15 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

18Mr Sopronick, do you understand what I have just done. You must spend at least two years in custody but it is backdated to when you were arrested. So you must remain in custody until 21 January next year. You are eligible to be released on parole after that. Whether you will be released or not is not a matter for me, it is up to the Parole authorities. If you are released you will be serving a sentence, although you will be in the community, until 21/01/18. So while you are on parole there is always a risk that if you do something wrong you will go back into custody to serve out the remainder of your sentence. Do you understand that?

19OFFENDER: Yes. your Honour.

		17 March 2014",2014-02-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763210,M O v REGINA [2014] NSWCCA 11,"Judgment
1RS HULME AJ:  On 8 November 2013 Lakatos DCJ sentenced the offender and a co-offender JB in respect of an offence of, on 10 January 2013 detaining SW without her consent with the intent of committing a serious indictable offence, namely, actual bodily harm in company in circumstances of special aggravation, namely, them being in company with (each other) and PM, and at the time actual bodily harm was occasioned to SW.
2The offence is one arising under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 and rendered the applicant liable to imprisonment for 25 years.
3At the time, the applicant was aged fifteen and eight months and JB was something under a year older and SW seems to have been aged 19.
4The sentence imposed on the applicant was imprisonment for 18 months commencing on 8 November 2013, including a non-parole period of 9 months.  The sentence imposed on JB was imprisonment for 2 years including a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 1 June 2013.  His Honour observed that this date was when JB went into custody for other matters and ""there is a large element of leniency involved in making those entirely concurrent"". 
5The grounds of appeal are:
(1)His honour failed to take into account the fact of the applicant having a five month old baby when sentenced
(2)The sentence is manifestly excessive
(3)There is a marked disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed on her co-offender JB, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance of the part of the applicant.
6The circumstances of the offence are that all persons were in PM's flat.  PM told SW to leave.  When SW did she was pursued by PM.  PM, then in company with JB, sat SW down on a brick wall where SW was punched in the face twice by PM and three times by JB.  These persons then walked SW back into the flat, in the course of which exercise JB elbowed SW twice in the face.  In the flat PM walked SW into a rear bedroom.  JB and the applicant followed.
7There PM again punched the victim.  JB grabbed the victim's arms while PM continued punching.  PM told the applicant to punch SW and the applicant did so once in the face.  All three offenders then walked SW to the door of the flat and ""shoved her outside"".  The victim's injuries were described by the doctor who treated her as ""undisplaced comminuted fractures to her nose which had healed well"" and ""terrible facial bruising over the cheek, nose and jaw"" and the extent of facial bruising was described as ""awful.""
8His Honour concluded that PM was the instigator and principal perpetrator and that the applicant was not involved in the initial detention of SW and took a much lesser role in the assaults than did JB.  He described the applicant's role as comparatively subsidiary.
9At the time of the offence against SW, JB had committed offences of, in October 2012 shoplifting and in November 2012 assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  In May 2013 she committed further offences that included robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In August 2013 she was sentenced for these and other offences committed.  One of the sentences then imposed was a control order for two months commencing on 1 June 2013 although it should be noted that this and other (non-custodial) sentences imposed at the same time are the subject of appeals against severity. The Court was told today that it would seem these appeals were not proceeded with but I don't regard that as of significance for the purpose of this appeal. JB was on bail at the time of the offences dealt with by Lakatos DCJ.  JB was also itinerant and consuming ice daily and any other drug she could obtain.  
10JB had been fostered from an early age due to her mother being unable to care for her.  The foster relationship had broken down in 2012 due to JB's erratic and violent behaviour.  In early 2013 she was in a refuge where she was found unconscious after taking Xanax, cannabis and alcohol.  Lakatos DCJ remarked that JB's inability or lack of commitment at that time to further her rehabilitation was troublesome.
11Earlier JB, who was described as intelligent, had been awarded a scholarship to SCEGGS High School.  She left and went to another high school where her time was marked by inconsistent attendance and behavioural issues.  She is intelligent and a talented sportswoman and talented student.
12His Honour observed that JB would benefit from a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation programme and requires anger management and counselling.  While recognizing the possibility that JB might lead a lawful and productive life, his Honour was not prepared to find that her prospects of rehabilitation were good.  His Honour remarked that he thought that JB's expressions of remorse might reflect more upon her own circumstances than the position of the victim.
13The applicant is the second of eight aboriginal children.  Her parents' relationship was characterised by way of frequent fights and alcohol misuse and the applicant and her older brother had most of the responsibility for looking after her younger siblings.  She was exposed to domestic violence, financial hardship and substance abuse.  She was said to have had no significant behavioural issues until she was 15 although other evidence was to the effect that she was consuming alcohol from age 13 and experimenting with cannabis.  She left school midway through year 9.  Psychological testing placed her in the borderline to low average level of ability and intelligence.
14She gave birth to a son on 7 June 2013.  According to the author of a Pre-Sentence Report that changed her view of life and she has a good relationship with her partner and appears to take responsibility for her actions and has now distanced herself from her peers.
15At the time of the offence against SW the applicant had no criminal record.  It is not clear what conclusion his Honour came to as to her risk of re-offending but generally the matters to which his Honour referred argued for her having reasonable prospects of not re-offending.                                                                                                                                                           
16JB and the applicant pleaded guilty and were awarded the 25% discount for doing so.  In the sentencing of JB an offence on a Form 1 of common assault was taken into account.  That offence was JB's punching of the victim in the face.
17A victim impact statement was before his Honour.  It is unnecessary for me to quote from it but his Honour recorded that he had little doubt that the victim would carry the psychological impacts of what occurred for a very long time.
18I turn to the grounds of appeal:Ground 1
His Honour failed to take into account the fact of the applicant having a five month old baby when sentenced
19In regards to the applicant's five-month-old baby, his Honour indicated: ""I have given long regard to the fact that you are a new mother.  It is regrettable that you will be separated from your child.  Unfortunately, as I see my duty, I have no option but to impose such a sentence.""
20During the course of submissions his Honour quoted a psychologist who examined the applicant:""Ms Hopkins, the psychologist who examined the applicant says, and I accept this, it would be unfortunate if this offender was placed on a control order given the age of her child.  It is one matter I have had long regard to.""
21In the face of these remarks the first ground as expressed must fail.  There was no evidence adduced as to what was to happen to the applicant's baby in the event of the applicant being incarcerated or evidence as to the probable effect on the baby from separation.  In these circumstances, there is no error in his Honour failing to find that the impact on the child would have been such as to bring the circumstances within the rare category where the impact of incarceration on an offender's family can go in mitigation.
22It may be accepted that the existence of the baby would be likely to make the applicant's incarceration harsher on her than otherwise but that can most conveniently be dealt with under ground two.
Ground 2
The sentence is manifestly excessive
23His Honour properly drew attention to the seriousness of the attack on SW and the need for a sentence to reflect the objective gravity of the offence.  Furthermore, it is clear that he recognized the subjective circumstances favourable to the applicant.  That said, in my view, he did not give the latter sufficient weight.
24The applicant had no prior record.  She had no history of violence.  On her part there was no premeditation.  She had no part in the initial detention of the victim and only a limited involvement after. She was not an instigator of the attack and administered one punch.  She had a background such that she was unlikely to have had inculcated in her, with the strength one would fairly ask of parents, respect for others.  The evidence indicated remorse and reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  She had a five-month-old child.  In these circumstances, the sentence imposed on the applicant should not have involved full-time custody and the sentence that was imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground 3  
There is a marked disparity between the sentence imposed on the applicant and that imposed on her co-offender JB, giving rise to a justifiable sense of grievance of the part of the applicant.
25In light of the conclusion just expressed, it is unnecessary for me to explore this ground.  However, it is not inappropriate to observe that I would find in the applicant's favour on this ground also.  The difference in criminality between JB and the applicant, together with the difference in the subjective circumstances, demanded that there be a significantly greater difference in their sentences than Lakatos DCJ imposed.  Particularly this is so, when account is taken of the concurrency implicit in JB's sentences.  In effect JB was given one month more in her non-parole period than was the applicant.
Conclusion
26It becomes necessary for this Court to re-sentence.  Against that possibility an affidavit of the applicant was read.  In it the applicant deposed to using her time in custody to advantage and that she has not misbehaved.  In these circumstances, and being satisfied that the pre-conditions exist, an appropriate sentence is a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The applicant has spent over three months in custody and in these circumstances the term of the bond should be one year.   
27I propose the following orders:
(i) Grant leave to appeal
(ii) Allow the appeal;
(iii) Quash the sentence imposed by Lakatos DCJ on 8 November 2013;
(iv) Order that the applicant be discharged upon her entering a good behaviour bond for a period of 1 year from the date it is entered into.
28HALL J:  I agree.
29EMMETT JA:  I agree with the observations made by RS Hulme AJ and with the orders he proposes for the reasons given by him.  The orders of the Court, will, therefore, be those that were just announced by RS Hulme AJ.

		20 February 2014",2014-02-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763242,Hunter v Chief Registrar of Local Court of New South Wales [2014] NSWSC 79,"Judgment
1The Plaintiff, by Summons filed on 20 November 2013, seeks two orders: 
(i)A declaration that the Plaintiff have his defence to prosecution heard at the Local Court of NSW, Downing Centre Registry; 
(ii)The prosecution is stayed until the Summons is heard. 
2The Plaintiff appears for himself today.  He informs me that the Police Prosecutor has been advised of his application but is not intending to appear.  There is some correspondence that has been filed in support of the Summons, demonstrating that the Police oppose the order that he seeks to transfer the proceedings.
3The Plaintiff has been charged with supply and possession offences concerning prohibited drugs, contrary to section 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The documents indicate that, ultimately, the matter will be dealt with on indictment. 
4It is not clear to me from the material if what is proposed to be determined at Sutherland Local Court are committal proceedings only or something else.  There was no evidence about whether a plea has been, or is to be, entered.
5In any event, the Plaintiff made application to the Local Court at Sutherland to transfer the proceedings to the Downing Centre.  The basis for this is that the Plaintiff, from time to time, acts as a McKenzie friend to litigants appearing at the Sutherland court.  He says that, as a result of so acting, his role has strained relationships at the court and he has concerns about whether he will be accorded procedural fairness in that court.  He points out also that the other persons who have been charged with him in relation to these offences are to be dealt with at the Downing Centre. 
6Mr Hunter's case is listed at the Sutherland Local Court because he asked if he could be charged at Sutherland or in that area because he resided at Cronulla.  At the time he was not aware that such a request would result in the proceedings being listed at the Sutherland Local Court.  He points out that the police concerned are based in Surry Hills and that the allegations relate to Marrickville where the offences, it appears, are alleged to have been committed.
7There might, in substance, be some basis for transferring the proceedings.  I do not know why the Local Court at Sutherland did not transfer them because no reasons for their decision have been provided to me at this hearing. 
8The difficulty for the Plaintiff is to show what jurisdiction this Court has to hear his Summons.  Section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 gives any court the power to change the venue for criminal proceedings which are before it.  That was no doubt the basis of the jurisdiction that the Registrar at Sutherland Local Court exercised.  However, it is necessary to point to some legislative basis for any appeal or review of that decision to come to this court.  
9Section 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 gives a person a right to appeal to this Court if that person has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court and the only ground for the appeal involves a question of law.  Section 53 provides for an appeal with leave where there are questions of fact involved but again, only where the person appealing has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court.  There does not appear to be any power under that Act for preliminary or procedural decisions to be reviewed.
10This Court, of course, has power as a superior court of record, to issue orders in the nature of prerogative writs.  Section 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 confirms the jurisdiction which this Court undoubtedly has.  This has also has recently been confirmed in the High Court's decision in Kirk V Industrial Relations Commission of NSW & WorkCover NSW [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531
11If Mr Hunter is seeking to obtain a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Registrar, he would at least have to show that there was an error of law on the face of the record.  It would appear, as I have said, that the Registrar had jurisdiction to make the order.  Because I do not have any reasons of the Registrar for refusing the transfer of venue, it is not possible for me to conclude, one way or the other, whether the Registrar has made an error that would entitle me to issue an order in the nature of certiorari. 
12I note that Mr Hunter's Summons, in form, seeks a declaration.  This Court has wide power to issue declarations but ordinarily will be guided by legislative intent if a declaration has the potential to conflict with other provisions that limit or restrict a right to come to this Court.  It does not appear that this Court is given jurisdiction to review preliminary and procedural decisions of the Local Court in criminal matters unless by its prerogative jurisdiction.  
13The proper method of challenging the refusal of the Local Court to transfer the proceedings is to seek prerogative relief.  To do so successfully necessarily requires the Local Court's record including its reasons to be available.  It would be inappropriate to make a declaration in the absence of such material.  Nor would it be appropriate to issue a declaration that the proceedings should be transferred simply because that is the order I would have made if making the decision at first instance.  To make a declaration in either such case would result in conflicting decisions.  The Registrar's order would remain in the absence of an order quashing it.
14In those circumstances, the Summons must be dismissed.  
15The Summons filed 20 November 2013 is dismissed.

1On 21 October 2013, Christopher John Paton (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the offender"" in these remarks on sentence) was arraigned in the Supreme Court at Albury before a jury panel and me.  The indictment contained a single count of murder.  The issue between the Crown and the offender in the trial was a circumscribed one.  The Crown alleged that the offender had been criminally involved in the murder by shooting of Mr Semin Rizvic (to whom I shall usually refer as ""the deceased"" in these remarks) before or during its occurrence.  The position of the offender was that he was merely an accessory after the fact to that murder.  By way of its verdict of guilty delivered on 4 November 2013, the jury determined that issue in favour of the Crown.
2The maximum penalty for the offence of murder in New South Wales is imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole.  In the circumstances of this case, there is also an applicable standard non-parole period of 20 years.  I have borne those two important guideposts firmly in mind.  The Crown Prosecutor has not submitted that this is a case that should lead to the imposition of the maximum penalty.  Nor do I consider that the imposition of such a penalty is appropriate in this case.  
Fact finding
3My approach to the determination of the facts of the matter is as follows.  Any fact that I regard as adverse to the offender above and beyond the elements of the offence must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  A fact that I regard to be in his favour need be proven on the balance of probabilities only.  It may be that the evidence will not permit me to determine some facts with clarity.  It is not my role to try to construe the findings of fact that may have underpinned the verdict of the jury.  Rather, I must make my own findings, consistent with that verdict: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587.
4The task of fact finding in this matter is complicated by a number of aspects.
5First, the Crown case at trial had two bases.  The first was the proposition that the offender was guilty of murder because he engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with the principal offender to murder the deceased, and the offender was present at the scene when that occurred.  The second basis of the Crown case was the proposition that, before or during the murder, with knowledge that it was to occur or was occurring, the offender intentionally encouraged or assisted the principal to commit that crime.
6The second complicating factor is that I have previously conducted a trial and imposed sentence with regard to the principal offender, a Peter John Kearnes: see R v Kearnes (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1652.  Both the Crown Prosecutor in this matter and senior counsel for the offender have submitted that I must, as a matter of procedural fairness to both parties, put from my mind all of the evidence and submissions placed before me in the trial and proceedings on sentence with regard to Mr Kearnes.  I accept that submission, and, with the assistance of counsel, I have done so.
7The third complicating factor is that, in the proceedings on sentence, whilst both parties of course accepted that I must sentence consistently with the verdict of the jury, there remained a dispute about the facts.  To state its ambit succinctly, the Crown Prosecutor accepted in the proceedings on sentence that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was present at the scene of the crime.  However, he submitted that I would be satisfied to the criminal standard that, for many hours before the murder occurred, the offender was aware that it was to take place, and furthermore the offender took active steps during that time to assist Mr Kearnes to carry it out.
8In contrast, senior counsel for the offender submitted that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender became aware of the fact that the deceased was to be shot until shortly before it occurred.  He also submitted that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender provided any encouragement or assistance to the principal offender, above and beyond being in his company for some period of time before the murder.
9That controversy requires a degree of analysis of the evidence by me, and will be resolved later in these remarks.
10The fourth complicating factor with regard to fact finding is that those submissions of the Crown are based very much on the evidence of the witness Tamsin Cameron.  She is a person about whom I made adverse credit findings in my remarks on sentence with regard to Mr Kearnes.  Again, I have restricted my assessment of her credibility for the purpose of resolution of this dispute to the evidence in these proceedings.
Undisputed matters
11In that difficult context, I first turn to set out the facts that were not in dispute in the trial or the proceedings on sentence.  I shall state them in general chronological order.
12The offender and Ms Tamsin Cameron met in April or May 2011.  The offender and Mr Kearnes met in a hotel shortly after that time.  Ms Cameron and Mr Kearnes met in the first half of July 2011.  All three individuals were users of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine (to which I shall refer in these remarks as ""amphetamines"").  Each of them lived in the small country town of Tumut, and was a part of the drug milieu of that community.
13On 20 July 2011, the deceased was living alone in a ground floor apartment in a block of flats in Edward Street, Wagga Wagga.  The deceased had been in an intermittent relationship with the former wife of Mr Kearnes.  The regional centre of Wagga Wagga is over one hour's drive from Tumut.
14On Wednesday 20 July 2011, Mr Kearnes attended a celebration for the birthday of his former wife in Wagga Wagga.  On the same day, the offender and Ms Cameron travelled together by motor vehicle from Tumut to Canberra.  On the return journey, they stopped at a very small township by the name of Hall and consumed amphetamines together.  Later, at a time when the offender was the driver, an argument developed between him and Ms Cameron about her assertion that he was driving too fast.
15That evening, the offender, Ms Cameron, and Mr Kearnes were all at the home of Mr Kearnes in Dalhunty Street, Tumut.  The offender and Mr Kearnes left those premises together, and returned together, with an acquaintance, Mr Peter Minogue, who remained at Dalhunty Street with Ms Cameron until early the next morning.  At an indeterminate time later that evening, but certainly before midnight, the offender and Mr Kearnes left Dalhunty Street together.  Although a vehicle belonging to Mr Kearnes was available, they chose to depart in a vehicle belonging to Ms Cameron instead.
16At 2:29 AM on Thursday, 21 July 2011, a mobile telephone associated with Mr Kearnes called a mobile telephone associated with Mr Minogue.  That call was made through the Tumut Lookout mobile phone tower.
17At 4:48 AM, the upstairs neighbour of the deceased was woken by a number of noises.  Those noises were the result of Mr Kearnes repeatedly shooting the deceased to the head and neck with a .22 calibre firearm whilst they were both together in the apartment of the deceased.
18Shortly after the deceased died as a result of the administration of those shots, his body was mutilated by way of his ear and a portion of his scalp being cut off with some sort of sharp implement.  Deplorably, that part of his body was thrown into the garden of the block of flats.
19At 4:51 AM, the mobile phone associated with Mr Kearnes called the mobile phone associated with Ms Cameron.  The call passed through the Wagga Wagga telephone tower.  Another call was made at 4:57 AM with identical attributes.
20At 5:28 AM the offender, bizarrely dressed in some sort of long robe, entered a BP service station located very close to the premises where the murder by shooting had occurred 40 minutes or so before.  He left promptly, but returned for a brief period at 5:36 AM.
21Between 5:30 and 6 AM, the upstairs neighbour to whom I have referred saw the offender sitting on the fence outside the block of flats in which the murder had taken place.  Later, the offender came up the internal stairs of the apartment block and spoke to the upstairs neighbour in the vicinity of her front door.
22Very soon after 6 AM, the telephone associated with Mr Kearnes called a telephone associated with Ms Cameron.  That call, again, was transmitted through the Wagga Wagga telephone tower.  A call with identical attributes occurred at 6:16 AM.
23Shortly thereafter, the body of the deceased was located in his apartment by the upstairs neighbour to whom I have referred, and 000 was called.
24At 6:41 AM, a description of the appearance of the deceased can be heard on a recording of what was said on the police radio.  Twenty seconds later, the sound of a dog barking can be heard on the police radio.
25Sometime between 7 AM and 8 AM, Ms Cameron met the offender and Mr Kearnes by arrangement in the Tumblong area.  Tumblong is a very small township generally located between Wagga Wagga and Tumut.
26At about 8 AM, a gentleman who lived on the outskirts of Tumut saw Ms Cameron in his driveway.  She was in a disoriented state, having either fallen asleep or passed out in her vehicle.
27At about 5 pm that evening, the offender was pulled over for speeding by the highway patrol near the township of Yass. He was driving the vehicle of Mr Kearnes and was heading north.  Present in the front passenger seat was Mr Kearnes.
28On 2 September 2011, the police located the offender at the home of Mr Kearnes in Dalhunty Street.  On the same day, the offender chose to take part in a recorded interview with the police.  In that interview, he denied any knowledge of the murder, and told a large number of other lies.
29Sometime in October 2011, the offender had at least one conversation with his aunt.  Because the details of the conversation were disputed to a degree in the trial, I shall return to them later.
30In short, it was not in dispute on the part of senior counsel for the offender that the offender travelled with Mr Kearnes from Tumut to Wagga Wagga in the very early hours of the morning of the murder.  Nor was it disputed that Mr Kearnes mercilessly shot the deceased and caused his death shortly before 5 AM that morning.  Nor was it disputed that, after the murder, the offender took steps to assist Mr Kearnes to evade justice with regard to his crime, well knowing that Mr Kearnes had committed it.
Disputed matters
31A number of discrete matters require resolution by me.  It was accepted by both parties that, as I have said, before I could take any disputed matter into account against the offender in aggravation, above and beyond the elements of the offence of which he was convicted by the jury, I would need to be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt.
32The first matter in dispute is whether, on the trip back from Canberra, the offender justified the speed at which he was driving by saying words to the effect that he was in a hurry because he and Mr Kearnes had something to do that evening.  The ancillary question is whether, if I were satisfied that those words were said, that was a reference to a murder that at that stage had already been planned between the two men.
33The second issue is whether I am satisfied that, when the offender and Ms Cameron returned to Dalhunty Street and there met Mr Kearnes, present in the lounge room was a cut-down firearm that must have been seen by the offender.
34The third issue in dispute is whether ammunition was present at the same place and time, and whether the offender was aware of that as well.  If so, an ancillary question is whether the offender took steps to secure and store that ammunition in the lounge room.
35The fourth issue is whether, before they left the premises that evening, Mr Kearnes forcefully stated his intention, in the hearing of the offender, to kill a ""paedophile"".
36The fifth issue is whether, shortly before their departure, the offender himself instructed Ms Cameron to listen to a scanner that was present at the home.
37The sixth and final issue is whether, in the early hours of the morning, the offender spoke to Ms Cameron whilst using the mobile phone of Mr Kearnes, and instructed her to listen carefully to the scanner in the next few minutes.
Evidence of Tamsin Cameron
38Resolution of all of those matters requires a careful consideration of the evidence of Ms Cameron in the trial.  That is because, with regard to all of the matters in dispute, her evidence stands alone in support of them.
39Since the proceedings on sentence one week ago I have taken the opportunity to re-read in its entirety the transcript of the evidence that Ms Cameron gave in the trial.  
40There were a number of markedly unsatisfactory aspects of the evidence of that witness.
41The first was her demeanour.  Ms Cameron was agitated in the witness box and frequently interrupted counsel and, on occasion, me.  She was unable or unwilling to answer a direct question directly on many occasions.  She insisted on giving rambling and discursive explanations.  Eventually, in the absence of the jury, I felt compelled to mention to her the possibility of punishment if she did not comply with my repeated requests.  One was entitled to suspect from her demeanour that she was perhaps under the influence of a prescribed or prohibited stimulant.
42Secondly, on the Crown case, Ms Cameron was unquestionably a person who was deeply involved in the murder of the deceased.  On the Crown case, she listened to the scanner in order to permit Mr Kearnes and the offender to commit the offence and to maximise their chance of evading the police.  On the Crown case, after the offence she met the two men at Tumblong in order to help them escape justice.  It could be said that, on the Crown case, Ms Cameron was an accessory before and after the murder.
43Thirdly, for many months, Ms Cameron said nothing about the events of that evening to anyone in authority.  Indeed, she provided the police with two statements denying any knowledge of what occurred and which were therefore thoroughly dishonest.
44Fourthly, on her own evidence, it was only after the police had intimated to her that she was facing many years in gaol as a result of her own actions that she then gave a detailed statement implicating Mr Kearnes and the offender.
45Fifthly, there were a large number of inconsistencies and discrepancies between that statement, the evidence that she gave at the committal hearing of the offender, the evidence she gave in the trial of Mr Kearnes, and the evidence she gave in the trial of this offender.
46Sixthly and finally, in September 2011, Ms Cameron was recorded by way of a lawfully obtained telephone interception calling a friend in Canberra.  That call is well open to the interpretation that Ms Cameron was herself seeking to engage a contract killer to murder some other individual, perhaps Mr Kearnes.  In the witness box, Ms Cameron provided an explanation for that call that was thoroughly incoherent, and which I firmly reject as a lie on oath.
47In all of the circumstances, whilst I by no means automatically reject everything that Ms Cameron has had to say, I certainly approach her assertions with the utmost caution.
48Finally, I note for completeness that the offender neither gave evidence in the trial or proceedings on sentence, nor called any witness, with regard to these disputed matters.  Of course, those facts play no role in diminution of the heavy burden that the Crown must discharge.
Resolution of disputed matters
49I turn to my analysis and resolution of the six matters in dispute.
50As for the discussion in the motor vehicle on the return trip from Canberra, it is not disputed that the offender was indeed driving fast, and that that led to a serious argument between the offender and Ms Cameron.  Despite my caution, I am satisfied that the offender gave that explanation for his driving.  In short I am satisfied that the offender did say those words, and furthermore that he and Mr Kearnes had arranged to ""do something"" that evening.
51However, I am by no means satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at that stage, there was a formulated plan between the offender and Mr Kearnes to murder the deceased.  To the contrary, I consider that it is a reasonable possibility that, at that stage, the agreement was merely to threaten or assault the deceased.  In that regard, I am fortified by the evidence of the aunt of the offender, who gave evidence that her nephew had said something to her to that general effect, and I assessed her as a witness of truth.
52As for the presence of the firearm at Dalhunty Street, it is true that on different occasions Ms Cameron has given different descriptions of it.  Originally she described it as a rifle, which is consistent with the fired cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting.  On at least one other  occasion, she seemed to be describing it as a sawn off double-barrelled shotgun.  There have also been discrepancies in her versions as to where Mr Kearnes was standing or sitting when she first observed the firearm.  And yet from the date of her third statement many months ago, she has been adamant about its presence.  In the witness box she described her sighting of it in emotive terms that, to my mind, had the ring of truth.  Finally, it will be recalled that there was no dispute on the part of senior counsel for the offender that Mr Kearnes did indeed travel from Tumut to Wagga Wagga in the vehicle of Ms Cameron that evening, and did indeed shoot the deceased at the latter location.  I consider that there is force in the submission that the learned Crown Prosecutor made to the jury, which may be summarised as being the proposition that the firearm could not have originally been in the vehicle of Ms Cameron; it had to travel to the vehicle from some other location before the journey was undertaken; and that location was the home in which Ms Cameron had seen it.
53I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the firearm was in the premises at Dalhunty Street on that evening.  And I am satisfied to the same standard that the offender was aware of its presence.
54With regard to the third issue, the presence of the ammunition in the home, again, there have been discrepancies in the evidence of Ms Cameron.  At one stage in the past she has spoken of a single box, but at the trial was speaking of boxes of ammunition.  Nevertheless, for the same general reasons, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ammunition was in the home on the evening in question, and that the offender was aware of its presence.
55However, I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the offender himself touched or otherwise dealt with the ammunition whilst it was in the home.
56As for the forceful expression by Mr Kearnes of his intention to kill that evening, it is true that there have been some minor discrepancies in the version given by Ms Cameron of the precise words used.  But in truth there has been no evidence that the deceased was a paedophile, or that Mr Kearnes had the slightest reason to suspect him of being one.  In other words, the fact that those words may have been said by Mr Kearnes to lay a false trail has about it a ring of truth.  Again, in the witness box, Ms Cameron was adamant and emotional about the fact that those words were said.  Finally, I consider it to be very significant that the evidence of the aunt of the offender was that he said to her that he had been told by Mr Kearnes that the person to be ""sorted out"" was a paedophile.
57Despite my great caution, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the intention to kill was indeed expressed by Mr Kearnes, and heard and understood by the offender.
58As for the proposition that the offender himself directed Ms Cameron to monitor the scanner before the two men departed Dalhunty Street, whilst I am satisfied that she certainly did undertake that task by way of the item that was subsequently located by the police, I am not satisfied to the requisite degree that it was the offender himself who gave that order.  I think that there is a reasonable possibility that in truth it was Mr Kearnes.
59In the same vein, I am not satisfied that it was the offender, using the telephone of Mr Kearnes, who spoke to Ms Cameron in the early hours of the morning and asked her to closely monitor the police radio in the subsequent few minutes.  Again, I consider that there is a reasonable possibility that, in truth, the speaker was Mr Kearnes.
60To summarise my findings of fact then, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a prearranged plan between the offender and Mr Kearnes to murder the deceased as at the time of the trip from Canberra to Tumut.  I am satisfied that, in the evening, the offender was aware of the presence of a firearm and suitable ammunition, each of which was available to Mr Kearnes.  I am also satisfied that, before the two men left the home, Mr Kearnes expressed an intention to kill.  
61It follows that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, from the time of their departure well before midnight on the evening of 20 July 2011, the offender was aware that his friend Mr Kearnes was intending to commit a murder, and the offender accompanied him with that state of awareness.  However, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender committed any other particular act that assisted or encouraged Mr Kearnes to complete that crime before or during its occurrence. 
62To my mind, it cannot be established that the offender and Mr Kearnes were necessarily in each other's company during the whole of the period between their departure from Dalhunty Street and the commencement of their trip to Wagga Wagga.  It follows that I shall sentence the offender on the basis that his encouragement or assistance is made out by way of his being in the company of Mr Kearnes during the hour-long trip to Wagga Wagga, and his presence in the general vicinity of the apartment block in which the shooting took place.
Objective seriousness of the offence
63It is convenient now to turn to a brief assessment of the objective seriousness of this murder.  At the outset, I accept the general proposition put forward by senior counsel for the offender that, very often, the objective criminality of an accessory will be substantially less than that of a principal.  And I consider that that submission is apposite in the circumstances of this case.  As I have said, it was Mr Kearnes who entered the flat of the deceased and cold-bloodedly murdered him.  One cannot be satisfied that the offender was present in the appartment at that time.  Nor can one be satisfied, as I explained a moment ago, that the offender provided Mr Kearnes with active or specific help in carrying out that crime.
64Having said that, I have found as a fact that, for many hours, the offender well knew what was to occur.  His presence in the company of Mr Kearnes intentionally encouraged or assisted Mr Kearnes to complete the crime.  The matter may be sharply contrasted with a murder whereby, for example, an offender involves himself in a brawl and, for a few brief seconds, intentionally encourages or assists a friend to inflict really serious physical injury on an opponent with the intention to do so.
65I assess the objective criminality of the offender as very grave.
Subjective features
66I have spoken at length of the circumstances of the crime, and my resolution of disputed facts relating to it.  I turn now to discuss the personal life and character of the offender.  
67As I have said, this matter required resolution by way of a trial.  Of course, the offender is not to be punished for adopting that position.  And I consider that he deserves some credit for the concise and focused way in which these proceedings were conducted.  It is also the case, as I have said, that by the time of trial the offender admitted that he had been an accessory after the fact to murder, a fact that the Crown asserts is quite correct.
68Having said that, there is no evidence, whether at the time of the trial or at the time of the proceedings on sentence, of remorse on the part of the offender with regard to the murder in which the jury has found he involved himself. 
69Above and beyond the evidence in the trial, the evidence about the offender himself is established chiefly by his criminal record, along with a detailed psychological report.  That report is itself  founded upon things told to the psychologist by the offender and his mother.  The Crown Prosecutor accepted that I would be entitled to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of matters of background contained in that report.
70The offender is 30 years of age, having been born in Tumut in July 1983.  He has not enjoyed a life of good fortune or privilege.  To the contrary, he has suffered deprivation from an early age.
71The father of the offender had a serious problem with alcohol, and, when drunk, could be a very violent man.  Indeed, it is the case that he was imprisoned for severely assaulting the offender when the offender was a 13-year-old boy.  The mother of the offender informed the psychologist that, for over a quarter of a century, she was severely assaulted by her former husband.  So great was her fear of him that she decided to endure that treatment, because she felt it was safer to stay with him rather than try to escape and not know where he was and what he might do.
72By the time he left home at the age of 15 years in the event of the separation of his parents, the offender had already run away more than once, and been held in juvenile detention centres.  He misbehaved at school and was frequently suspended.
73I accept on the balance of probabilities without difficulty that the violence meted out to the mother of the offender and to the offender himself when he was a young boy damaged him emotionally and played a significant and ongoing role in his subsequent difficulties with alcohol and drugs, and his attendant criminality.
74The offender has been a drinker of alcohol since his early teens.  Alcohol quickly became a serious problem for him, and he was a daily drinker before he turned 18.  He informed the psychologist that it would not be uncommon for him to drink a bottle of whisky a day.  As recently as January this year, when he spoke to the psychologist after many months in custody, he stated that he ""loves alcohol and still craves it"".  I accept that part of the attraction of alcohol for him is that it calms him and reduces a feeling of stress from which he otherwise suffers, and which has proven resistant to relief by way of prescription medication.
75Quite apart from alcohol, the offender has abused prohibited drugs, most particularly cannabis and amphetamines.  The offender was open with the psychologist to the extent that he accepted that he is suffering a serious addiction to drugs and alcohol.  Regrettably, he has no plan for, or even serious thoughts, of abstinence in the community; he merely expressed the thought that that could occur ""one day"".
76As I have said, I accept that his addictions can be sheeted home to a significant degree to emotional problems arising from his brutal mistreatment as a child.  Having said that, his counsel accepted that there is no evidence that, on the evening in question, the offender was affected by drugs or alcohol, including the amphetamines that were ingested on the trip from Canberra.
77The criminal record of the offender does not do him credit.  Since the year 2000, when he was 17 years of age, he has been dealt with for a number of offences to do with driving, dishonesty, and violence.  He has seen fit more than once to contravene a court order in the form of an apprehended domestic violence order.  In the past he has been sentenced to various short periods of imprisonment.  There is a flavour in his criminal record of a person who has been unable or unwilling to obey the criminal law in general, and court orders in particular.  Having said that, by my reading all of his matters have been prosecuted in the Children's Court or the Local Court, and, as I said, all of the sentences to which he has been subject have been short ones.  There is nothing remotely approaching the seriousness of the current matter in this man's criminal antecedents.
78As against that, I regard it as a serious matter of aggravation that, as at the date of this murder on 21 July 2011, the offender was on parole.  That is because on 23 August 2010 he was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 15 months to commence on 19 July 2010 and to conclude on 18 October 2011.  A non-parole period of three months expired on 18 October 2010, and the offender was released on that date.  In other words, the offender had only been released from prison nine months before he involved himself in this murder.  Whilst I accept the submission of his counsel that he was on parole for a serious offence of driving rather than, for example, a serious offence of violence, nevertheless I regard his conditional liberty as a seriously aggravating matter.  It also gives one cause for concern with regard to his prospects of rehabilitation.
79Returning to the psychologist's report for a moment, the offender was found by the psychologist to be a person who seeks closeness and direction and yet fears rejection; who suffers from negative feelings with regard to his own self-worth; who is fatalistic and pessimistic; and who has an implicit distrust for others and the community.  I accept all of those findings, and consider that those aspects of the personality of the offender may have played a role in his involvement in this crime.  Before leaving the psychological report, I note that it says nothing of any mental illness suffered by the offender now or in the past.
Motive
80I turn now to the question of motive, and to the more general question of how it is that this man involved himself in this murder.
81The criminal record of Mr Kearnes was tendered in these proceedings on sentence.  It establishes that, at the time of the offence, Mr Kearnes was aged about 50 years and the offender was 28.  It also establishes that Mr Kearnes has a far more serious criminal record than the offender.  In particular, Mr Kearnes in the past has served, for a series of offences of physical and sexual violence, a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of eight years.
82As I have said, the position of the parties at trial was that it was Mr Kearnes who shot the deceased.  It was also, as I have explained, the Crown case that it was Mr Kearnes who, at his own home, possessed the firearm and expressed the intention to kill.  As I have indicated, the offender at the time of the offence was on parole, and it seems that he was living at a caravan park owned by his relatives in Tumut.  I accept that the offender had met Mr Kearnes in a hotel and commenced to do odd jobs for him.
83It is not easy to understand how a man such as the offender, with his reasonably limited criminal record, involved himself in this level of criminality.  I think there is force in the proposition of his counsel that the offender was ""carried along"" in the murder by way of the force of personality of Mr Kearnes, and I accept that proposition on the balance of probabilities.  Having said that, I also accept the submission of the Crown that there is no evidence that the offender was overawed or threatened or forced by Mr Kearnes to involve himself in this murder.
84On the evidence, I am unable to determine a precise motive for the commission of the offence by the offender.  Indeed, it seems that the offender had never even met the deceased.  On reflection, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender involved himself in this offence in a reprehensible attempt to ingratiate himself with Mr Kearnes.  Although I suspect that it could be the case that Mr Kearnes tricked the offender into believing that he was assisting in the meting out of punishment to a paedophile by way of execution, I am not satisfied of that matter to the necessary standard as a matter of aggravation or mitigation, and accordingly I put that suspicion to one side.
The future
85As for the future, I possess a guarded optimism about the prospects of rehabilitation of the offender.  In the past he has been a worker, and I expect that he will continue to be throughout the years ahead in custody.  He is in a romantic relationship of some years' standing with a lady who lives on the South Coast of New South Wales and who appears to be, on the limited description of her in the psychological report, a person of good standing in the community. She supports him by visiting him regularly.  As well as that, his mother attended throughout the trial, and was in attendance during the proceedings on sentence.  No doubt the love and support of those two women will assist his rehabilitation in the future.
86I also think that there is a reasonable prospect that the offender will come to see that he needs to address his abuse of drugs and in particular alcohol, and in order to do so he must address the underlying psychological damage that was done to him many years ago.  Although he will not be a young man when he becomes eligible for release, there will be ample time in his life for him to demonstrate that, even despite the gravity of what he has done, he deserves to be given another chance in the community.
Proportionality with sentence imposed upon Mr Kearnes
87I turn now to the question of proportionality between the sentence imposed upon Mr Kearnes and any sentence to be imposed upon the offender.  Senior counsel for the offender submitted that this is not a matter for the application of the concept of parity in the strict sense, in that the evidence, the issues, and my resultant findings of fact in the proceedings on sentence of Mr Kearnes are not identical with those in these proceedings with regard to the offender.  I accept that proposition, and I accept his further proposition that, nevertheless, there must be due proportion between the sentence imposed upon Mr Kearnes and the sentence imposed upon the offender.
88I repeat that, it is accepted between the parties in these proceedings that it was Mr Kearnes who shot the deceased.  I accept on the balance of probabilities on the evidence before me in these proceedings that it was Mr Kearnes who mutilated the body of the deceased and saw fit to leave his ear in the garden of the apartment block.  I am not satisfied to the criminal standard that the offender played any role in that act, or was aware that it was to occur.  Like the offender, Mr Kearnes ran a trial and expressed no remorse for his crime.  In sharp contrast to the offender, Mr Kearnes had previously served a lengthy term of imprisonment for offences of great violence.
89Mr Kearnes was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 30 years with a non-parole period of 22 years 6 months.  I respectfully accept the submission that proportionality calls, in all of the circumstances of this case, for the imposition of a head sentence and non-parole period upon the offender that is markedly less than those that were imposed upon Mr Kearnes.
Comparable cases
90Senior counsel for the offender provided me with two judgments, one at first instance and one of the Court of Criminal Appeal, to do with sentencing offenders who are guilty of murder by way of being an accessory.  Although I have found those decisions helpful, it can be seen that there are marked differences between the facts of those matters and this matter, and I regard the very lenient sentences imposed in those matters as well outside the bounds of my discretion in this case.
Various matters
91Before proceeding to impose sentence, I shall deal briefly with a number of short aspects of the matter.
92Although the offender, since his arrest on 10 November 2011, has served a short period of balance of parole, along with a short sentence for an unrelated offence, I consider that it is not inappropriate for me to provide him with a full backdate to the date of arrest.  The Crown prosecutor did not suggest otherwise.
93I do not propose mechanistically to state the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  Nor do I propose to review the reasons for my departure from the standard non-parole period.  In both cases, these remarks on sentence fulfil that role.  
94In light of the maturity of the offender, the previous sentences of imprisonment imposed upon him, and in particular the substantial length of any parole period, I do not find special circumstances that could lead to a reduction in the non-parole period.  
95I am required by recent legislation to inform the offender that, even though I shall impose a determinate sentence, he may be detained after the complete expiry of that sentence, if it is considered that his rehabilitation is insufficient and that he remains a danger to the community.
96Finally, after the proceedings on sentence, and two days before today, the High Court of Australia handed down its judgement in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2.  To state its effect very shortly, it was held that it was wrong in principle for a judge to receive from a Crown Prosecutor in proceedings on sentence a submission as to the range of sentences said to be open to the sentencing judge's discretion.
97In the proceedings on sentence one week ago, I enquired of the Crown Prosecutor whether he accepted the submission of senior counsel for the offender that the sentence to be imposed upon the offender should be markedly less than the sentence imposed upon Mr Kearnes.  I also enquired of the Crown Prosecutor whether he regarded a particular quantum of head sentence that senior counsel for the offender had submitted could be imposed as ""appropriate"".  I am uncertain whether the adoption of that course by me was contrary to the principle expounded in the judgment that was handed down several days later.  However, for abundant caution, I have put from my mind the responses of the Crown Prosecutor to those two enquiries of mine.
Moral blameworthiness
98Finally, I turn to assess the moral blameworthiness of the offender, taking into account all of the objective and subjective features to which I have referred.  In short, a man who had suffered psychological damage as a result of a very adverse upbringing, and who was carried along by a more powerful personality, involved himself in a crime of the utmost seriousness that was, for him, very out of character.  In terms of his actual criminality, he did nothing more than assist and encourage the principal by way of his knowing presence.  On the other hand, he knew for many hours that an innocent citizen was to be shot to death in his own home, and he intentionally helped the principal in that undertaking.  He has expressed no remorse for his crime; his criminal record is not free of acts of violence; and he was on parole at the time.  It cannot be denied that the moral blameworthiness of the offender is profound.  My sentence seeks to strike a balance with regard to all of the countervailing factors to which I have referred.
Sentence
99Christopher John Paton, you are convicted of the offence of murder.  I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 14 years 3 months, to date from 10 November 2011.  There will be a parole period of 4 years 9 months that expires on 9 November 2030.  The first date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 9 February 2026.
100To express my order another way, the offender is sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 19 years with a non-parole period of 14 years 3 months.

2763249,R v Abdallah (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 111,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Mr Matthew Edward Lewis has been called as a witness before me to give evidence about the death of Neal Todorovski, the victim of the murder charge brought against the accused. The proceedings before me are in the nature of a Basha inquiry. As is Mr Lewis's right he has declined to make a statement about his knowledge, and has not otherwise co-operated with the prosecution, except in one important respect to which I will return. 

2I repeat, it is the right of every citizen to decline to answer questions or at least to decline to make a statement if asked. 

3The Crown case against the accused is that he shot the deceased a number of times with a handgun in broad daylight in a residential street in the southern suburb of Sans Souci on 4th January 2012. It is the Crown case that before the accused produced the handgun and fired the shots, that the deceased was in the company of Mr Leger who was called earlier today, and Mr Lewis who is called now. 

4The Crown says that each of those persons was armed in some way. It is also the Crown case that there was a physical altercation involving the accused and Mr Leger in which Mr Todorovski and Mr Lewis participated and this altercation led to the production by the accused of a gun which he used to shoot the deceased and with which he discharged a shot at Mr Leger. 

5Because Mr Lewis has not made a statement, I acceded to an application to conduct a Basha inquiry in this matter so the evidence he may be able to give as a Crown witness in the prosecution of the accused could be ascertained so that the accused would know the nature of the case he had to meet. 

6When Mr Lewis was called this morning by the Crown Prosecutor he took an oath to tell the truth. He identified himself as Matthew Edward Lewis, but when asked about the events with which the court is concerned, he said ""I don't remember"", a response that he maintained when I asked him questions. 

7When I asked him questions about the apparent or prima facie absurdity of that response, he said he had taken a lot of Xanax and it had affected his memory. There is no evidence of a technical nature before me as to the effect, if any, of Xanax, a prescription drug, on the memory and what dosage might be necessary to be ingested to produce the effect of a total absence of recall. 

8Mr Clark of counsel who appears for Mr Lewis, asked for an adjournment in order to obtain that evidence. During the course of argument, I indicated that I refused that application for an adjournment for a number of reasons. Principal amongst them being there was no explanation given as to why, if that evidence was to be led, it was not made available today, given that it was well known to Mr Lewis the Crown intended to call him as a witness today, especially given the history of the matter in that he was subpoenaed to give evidence at the committal proceedings and the counsel then appearing for him, not Mr Clark, said there was a psychological reason why he couldn't answer questions. 

9No evidence was led there about that matter because the Crown did not persist in its intention to call Mr Lewis to give evidence at the committal. 

10In Coward v Stapleton (1953) 90 CLR 573, the High Court of Australia held that a refusal to answer questions lawfully required to be answered in proceedings might be proved by the giving by a witness of answers which are so plainly absurd as to convey an intention not to give any real answer to the questions to which they relate. 

11It seems to me prima facie, and prima facie only, that the evidence that Mr Lewis has given falls into that category justifying the conclusion, on my part, that there is sufficient material before me to justify charging Mr Lewis with contempt in the face of the court constituted by his constructive failure to answer questions. 

12I will proceed to lay that charge in due course. I make it clear, as would be known to all counsel in the case, and for Mr Lewis' benefit that in laying the charge I have not formed any conclusion on a final basis, whether or not Mr Lewis is guilty of contempt. He will be given the opportunity to answer that charge after the completion of the trial of the accused and he will at that stage have the opportunity to lead such evidence in his own defence as he wishes to lead and to make such arguments as to his guilt or innocence as he wishes to make. 

13However, in making these observations I accept the force of the submissions for the Crown that the obligation of any person called as a witness to answer questions is a fundamental one that goes to the very heart of the proper administration of, in this case, criminal justice. Allowing the adjournment sought by Mr Clark, or failing to charge Mr Lewis in the circumstances, that I have outlined in these reasons, would have the appearance of allowing a person like Mr Lewis, to flout the requirements imposed by law on every person called to give evidence in these courts, notwithstanding that he has not been found guilty of any such charge. 

14Mr Clark has applied for bail, should I charge Mr Lewis. He properly points out his client is unlikely to be a flight risk given that on the material before me, he has appeared when required. He appeared at the committal proceedings under subpoena and he has appeared here today under subpoena. He has not made it difficult for the prosecution to secure his attendance to give evidence. 

15I know little else about Mr Lewis that would be relevant to a question of whether he should be granted bail, pending the disposition of the charge which I propose to lay against him. I can well imagine that he would rather be at liberty and if at liberty could pursue lawful endeavours and the like. It has not been shown on any evidence before me that I need be concerned about him interfering with any other witness in the prosecution in any way or interfering with any juror to be empanelled in due course to hear the case.

16However I am concerned granting him bail will not bring home to him the seriousness of what I regard as, prima facie, his refusal to answer questions. Allowing him to go about his life in the usual way in the State of Queensland will not concentrate his mind on whether he should give serious consideration to the opportunity which he will have to purge his apparent contempt during the currency of the trial. 

17It seems to me, for the protection and welfare of the community as well as in the interests of the administration of justice, only if I commit him or remand him on custody pending the determination of the charge, will he be required to seriously contemplate the need to purge his contempt. He will be given the opportunity to do so simply by indicating to the authorities that he has changed his mind and he is willing to come to court and give evidence in this trial, and most importantly, to properly answer all questions required of him in relation to the proceedings. 

18My Orders are:

(1)Matthew Edward Lewis, I charge you with being in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful refusal to answer questions asked of you in the present proceedings when required to do so. I remand you in custody on a date to be fixed at the conclusion of this trial and I refuse bail.

(2)I will make the order as sought by the Crown under section 7 of the Court Suppression and Nonpublication Orders Act 2010. I order that the proceedings before me today, so far as they concern Mr Matthew Edward Lewis, may not be published by any person on the ground that a nonpublication order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice in that the jury panel who will assemble here on Wednesday, ought not to be exposed to the events of today, lest it interfere with their proper discharge of the duty of those of them empanelled to form a jury in the discharge of their obligations according to law. 

(3)That order inures until further order of the court and will dissolve upon the taking of the jury's verdict in the trial of the accused.

2763252,R v Abdallah [2014] NSWSC 110,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Mr John Leger appears before me today under a subpoena issued at the request of the Crown. Mr Leger is a person who was a witness to the alleged murder of Mr Neal Todorovski. He is also the alleged victim in the second count which the accused in these proceedings faces. 

2As is his right Mr Leger refused to provide a statement to the investigating police officers during the course of their investigation.

3The Crown case is that the accused shot Mr Todorovski in broad daylight in the southern suburb of Sans Souci using a handgun. It is part of the Crown case that prior to that the deceased, this witness and another had a confrontation with the accused in a public street. After an exchange of blows involving the accused and another person the Crown allege that the accused obtained a handgun from his motor vehicle which he discharged several times. Five or six bullets made contact with the deceased. It is also alleged that the accused chased Mr Leger down the driveway of a block of units. To get away it was necessary for Mr Leger to run away and negotiate a fence by either going over it or through a gate. During this chase, so the Crown say, the accused discharged another shot with the intention of murdering Mr Leger. 

4When he was called to give evidence before me this morning Mr Leger was asked about the events of the day of the shooting. He said ""I can't remember"". He gave that evidence, if that is what it is, more than once.

5To other questions asked by the learned Crowned Prosecutor he simply sat mute thereby declining to answer the questions. I interpolate the purpose of him giving evidence before me at this stage is in the nature of a Basha enquiry into the evidence Mr Leger would give if called as a Crown witness in the trial proper which will commence before the jury on Wednesday.

6The transcript will show that after a longish silence I asked Mr Leger whether he was refusing to give evidence or to answer questions required of him in the proceedings before me. Mr Leger said that he was refusing to answer questions. I allowed a short adjournment to enable Mr Leger to take the advice of his counsel, Mr Clark. When I resumed the Basha enquiry I asked Mr Leger whether, having had the opportunity of taking that further advice, he was now prepared to answer the questions required of him in these proceedings. Mr Leger said he was not.

7I indicated to counsel I thought the appropriate procedure in the circumstances of the case was that I charge Mr Leger with contempt in the face of the Court and that I commit him thereafter in custody on remand pending the conclusion of the trial, for the purpose of giving him the opportunity of considering his position and perhaps purging his apparent contempt.

8After debate about that and submissions from Mr Clark, including a submission that if I charged Mr Leger he should not be committed on remand, I again gave Mr Leger the opportunity to say whether he was now prepared to answer questions required of him in these proceedings. He said he was not.

9It seems to me appropriate that I should now charge Mr Leger with contempt in the face of the Court. I will do that in a moment. The procedure I propose to follow is, once he is charged I will stand that matter over until the conclusion of the trial when he will be brought back before me, or perhaps another judge, to be dealt with on the charge of contempt in the face of the Court. 

10Mr Clark of counsel has foreshadowed an application for bail. He has argued that I could have no reason to suppose that Mr Leger is a flight risk. He answered a subpoena to appear at the committal proceedings, although, in the event, he was not required to give evidence. And he not only answered a subpoena to give evidence today before me but he facilitated its service by attending the Police Station to accept service of the subpoena. I accept that those matters do suggest that Mr Leger would answer the charge when required.

11However I have no information about the nature of his community ties. There is nothing put before me which suggests that he has any particular need to be at liberty over and above the general wish of anyone to be at liberty. True it is that there is no material from which I could infer that any person, witness or juror, would be at risk if Mr Leger was at liberty. 

12However, that is not the end of the factors which I need to consider. In particular I need to consider the protection and welfare of the community, particularly the interests of the administration of justice in terms of the absolute imperative that members of our community co-operate with the authorities and with the Courts in the trial of serious criminal charges. As the learned Crown Prosecutor points out there could hardly be more serious charges than those faced by the accused before me of gunning down an individual in broad daylight in a public place and chasing and attempting to murder Mr Leger. The seriousness of these charges make it imperative that the Court treat seriously the obligation that Mr Leger owes to give evidence and to answer all questions required of him in this court. It seems to me there is force in the submission made by the learned Crown Prosecutor that the purpose of the law of contempt in this particular case may well be frustrated if I grant bail. In making these observations I bear in mind that as yet Mr Leger has not been asked to enter a plea to the charge. I also bear in mind that he will be given every opportunity to defend himself. I must say, however, there has been no explanation forthcoming from anyone in circumstances where he is legally represented justifying his refusal to answer questions. 

13Before me it was pointed out that at the committal proceeding there was some suggestion that because of a psychiatric condition Mr Leger might have been unable to give evidence in relation to these matters. No such evidence has been put before me and certainly from what I saw from the material before the Magistrate no such evidence was put before him. It would seem to me that the most compelling evidence of that type would be required if there was to be an excuse proffered for the failure of Mr Leger to answer the questions asked of him but I in no way pre-judge what evidence might be brought to bear on this question when he is dealt with for the charges. 

14It seems to me that the appropriate thing to do, given the nature of the contempt, is to refuse bail and to commit him to custody on remand pending determination of the charges. That will give him every opportunity should he think it appropriate to purge his apparent contempt and that may be done by him indicating to the authorities that he is willing to come to court during the trial to give evidence.

15My orders are:

(1)John Leger I charge you with being in contempt of the Supreme court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful refusal to answer questions asked of you in the present proceedings when required to do so.

(2)I commit you to custody until the conclusion of the present trial when arrangements will be made for you to be brought back to this court to answer the charge at that time. I refuse bail. 

(3)I make an order under section 7 of the Court Suppression and Non Publication Orders Act 2010 that the course of proceedings before me today from when Mr Leger was called to give evidence until he was committed into custody are not to be published by any person to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice in this case.

2763254,R v McKellar [2014] NSWSC 104,"Ex Tempore Judgment

1In these proceedings, to state matters succinctly, the preconditions for a special hearing that are contained in the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) have been established. 

2In order to commence the special hearing, the learned Crown Prosecutor has presented an indictment that contains three counts. 

3The first alleges, in short, the armed robbery of and infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Bruce Wentworth Delany in the town of Bourke on 21 May 2011. Count two alleges that on 23 May 2011, at the same location, the accused murdered the same person. And I understand that the evidential foundation of each of those counts is highly similar. 

4As for the third count, I understand from the Crown Prosector that the evidential foundation is somewhat divorced, in that it is founded on cash located upon the accused when he was arrested, and it is not alleged that that cash is the proceeds of the offence alleged in count one. 

5That raised a query in my mind (which has been resolved with the assistance of counsel) as to the appropriateness of this Court hearing count three. 

6It led me to reflect on s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) which speaks, in short, of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales issuing, if his Honour wishes, a Practice Note with regard to whether indictments for particular counts are to be presented in this Court or the District Court of New South Wales. 

7There is no need for me to recite the entirety of that section. It suffices to say that it leads one to Supreme Court Practice Note SC CL 2. Clause 14 of that Practice Note makes it clear that indictments for murder are to be presented in this Court. Indeed, the Practice Note refers to the well-known fact that, pursuant to clause 22 of the Criminal Procedure Regulation 2005, the District Court does not have jurisdiction with regard to allegations of murder. 

8If that were where matters end, one might be concerned with regard to the presentation of count three in the indictment in this Court. However, clause 16 of the Practice Note is as follows:

""Subject to the usual practice as to joinder of counts, an indictment charging an offence under any of the above sections may also contain counts charging other offences.""


9That reference to the ""usual practice"" leads one to s 21 and s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Act. It is quite clear that, with regard to count one, it is the usual practice in such circumstances (namely where it is alleged that a murder was committed and another closely related offence that could have, on its own, been dealt with in the District Court is also alleged) to present an indictment that contains that related count. Accordingly, there is no need for me to discuss count one any further.

10As for count three, I consider that it is the case that, if it were the position that senior counsel for the accused objected to one and the same tribunal of fact determining count three along with counts one and two, there may be some force to such an application to sever that count. 

11But the fact is, no doubt for sound reasons, there is no objection by senior counsel for the accused to the indictment in its current form. And I have been informed from the Bar table today that the indictment in its current form has been before the Supreme Court for many months now, and again, no doubt for sound reasons, there has been no objection to its form in the past. 

12In short I have satisfied myself that the indictment that has been presented, in light of the position of learned senior counsel for the accused, is appropriate and consistent with the applicable legislation, regulation, and Practice Note of this Court.

2763259,R v Weymark-Voilet [2014] NSWDC 364,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Dale Scott Weymark-Violet - as he is known in the indictment - but otherwise is referred to as Mr Weymark, appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty at the commencement of his criminal trial before me last year.
	
	
	The crime to which he pleaded guilty alleges that he on 1 August 2002, at Turramurra in the State of New South Wales, being in company with Matthew James Morgan, robbed Mostofa Hossain of a certain amount of money and packets of cigarette, the property of Harpeet Singh.
	
	
	This is an offence shortly called robbery in company, contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act (1900) and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. It has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The offender was in custody from the date of his arrest which was 1 August 2012 until 20 September 2012. That is a total period of one month and twenty days. That period of time in custody will be taken into account in the sentencing of the offender today. The best way to do that is to backdate the offender’s sentence to that period of one month and twenty days and to accord the offender, in relation to the sentence to be imposed today, the full discount permitted pursuant to the guideline judgment of R v Thomson and Houlton, a guideline judgment dealing with the utilitarian benefit to be accorded on a plea of guilty.
	
	
	There is no dispute in this matter, as I understand it, that the appropriate discount to be granted to the accused is 10%.
	
	
	The sentencing of this offender is very much to be seen in the context of the sentencing of Alexander James Van Kool and Matthew James Morgan, two offenders who I sentenced on 12 December 2013. The other two men were truly co-accused of this offender although ultimately Mr Van Kool pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the robbery in company, to which this offender has pleaded. His connection with the robbery was close. There are some gaps in the evidence it must be fairly said, but there was a very strong circumstantial evidence case to establish his approximate connection with the events that give rise to the current proceedings.
	
	
	The sentence imposed by me on 12 December 2013 that most compares with the circumstances of this offender is the sentence I imposed on Mr Morgan. He pleaded guilty to the same charge, was entitled to the same discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea. He asked me to take into account, in relation to the principal offence, the robbery in company offence, a matter on a Form 1 which carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment if dealt with separately.
	
	
	In my remarks on sentence I dealt with issues that led me to the conclusion that the appropriate sentence in relation to Mr Morgan was a sentence of four years, with a non-parole period of two years. Of course the issue of parity is primarily of concern with the sentence that should be imposed for the ‘total’ sentence, given the varying circumstances that might inform the decision as to what the appropriate non-parole period should be. Particularly of course the variation in circumstances that might constitute “special circumstances” between different offenders charged with the same offence.
	
	
	It may be in a particular sentencing exercise that two offenders receive the same “head sentence”, all relevant matters taken into account in fixing that sentence, but one offender may receive a finding of special circumstances requiring an adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence, and the other offender may not, leading to of course a longer minimum term if all other matters are equal.
	
	
	These remarks on sentence thus have been designed, as best they can be designed as an ex tempore judgment immediately after the submissions are finished, to reflect those principles that have been discussed in a range of authorities from Lowe v R from 1984, through to Postiglione in the late 1990’s, and recently the subject of considerable discussion in judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal such as R v Jimmy, a reported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal from 2010.
	
	
	The matter was probably most succinctly summed-up by Rothman J when he likened the parity principle, in the context of what had been said in Postiglione, to the Aristotelian concept of equality, “Alike shall be treated alike, and the unalike will be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness.” The problem here of course is that there are differing factors, some favourable to this prisoner, some unfavourable to this prisoner, from the circumstances of Mr Morgan.
	
	
	I do not propose to recite the facts of this matter now. There is a statement of facts which, as I understand it, is agreed, and I understand those facts are primarily the facts that were preferred against Mr Morgan. Many of the background details concerning the movements of this prisoner and Mr Morgan are much the same. In the earlier judgment of Mr Morgan I dealt with the respective roles of the two offenders.
	
	
	So far as the objective seriousness of the offending by comparison to that of Mr Morgan I stand by, as I am urged to do by learned counsel for the prisoner, the analysis that I made of the matter at pp 9-10 of my earlier judgment.
	
	
	Mr Weymark and Mr Morgan participated in a joint criminal enterprise. Mr Weymark, as the facts revealed, took the more aggressive role and the more leading role, but that having been said Mr Morgan was present and was an observer of all that happened. He continued to participate in the joint criminal enterprise upon which they had agreed. Ultimately the moral culpability of this prisoner, and the objective culpability of this prisoner was, in those circumstances, marginally greater than that of Mr Morgan.
	
	
	Mr Morgan was prepared to profit from the actions of the prisoner and there it can be no doubt on the facts of what the prisoner did was in furtherance of a joint criminal enterprise upon which the two men agree. Furthermore when one has regard to the criminal history of Mr Morgan, compared to that of this prisoner, the remarks I made about the matter, at pp 12-13 of my judgment in December this year still remain valid.
	
	
	This prisoner has a more extensive criminal history than both co accused, and certainly “far more extensive than Mr Morgan’s”. The details of this prisoner’s criminal history reflect the fact that on 9 September 2009, for offences of affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed in May that year, the prisoner received sentences of twelve months that were suspended pursuant to s 12 in the Local Court. Those bonds were revoked at the Local Court on 20 May 2010 and the offender was sentenced, as I understand the criminal history as best I can, to 12 months periodic detention with a non-parole period of eight months.
	
	
	The offender was convicted on 9 September 2009, the same date as he received the suspended sentences in respect of offences of common assault, affray - as I would understand it - and behaving in an offensive manner. Ultimately he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service in respect of the common assault and affray matter, receiving a s 10A conviction in relation to the other matter.
	
	
	With regard to those orders he was called up at the same time as he was called up in relation to the s 12 bonds for obviously failing to perform his community service. For those offences he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment by way of periodic detention.
	
	
	On 7 February 2011 he was convicted of destroying or damaging property and placed on a good behaviour bond for 15 months.
	
	
	On 20 May 2010, when he appeared at the Downing Centre Local Court, he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two months, in respect of an offence of stealing from the person committed apparently in September 2009.
	
	
	In November 2010 he was convicted of dishonestly obtaining property by deception, on three separate occasions, for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment; breaking, entering and stealing for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.
	
	
	On 8 February 2013 he was convicted of an offence committed in July 2012, but for which he was not on bail at the time of the commission of this offence, and given the benefit of a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9.
	
	
	Unlike Mr Morgan, as it appears from that record, I have not referred to a driving offence committed in June 2012 of special range PCA. The offender had committed substantial offences of violence for which he was imprisoned. As has been pointed out today in the submissions, Mr Morgan had not previously been imprisoned at the time that I had sentenced him for their offence, which is something that could not be said of this offender.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Van Kool, if I may just deal with him in passing, the issue of “parity” does not strictly arise in the context of him being sentenced for an offence of accessory after the fact to robbery. His sentence of course took place at the same time as Mr Morgan, and thus the comparative situations of those two offender taking into account varying subjective circumstances, ultimately warranted a lesser sentence for him. He did not bear the same degree of moral culpability, or objective criminal culpability, as Mr Morgan or the accused.
	
	
	I have pointed out the matters that might fairly be said to be adverse to this prisoner in a comparison of his circumstances with that of Mr Morgan, particularly at the time of the offending. To this prisoner’s credit - allowing for the factors I will point out in a moment - there are a range of other matters to be taken into account. There are two features of the matter, in his personal circumstances, that distinguish him favourably from Mr Morgan.
	
	
	In terms of assessing the appropriate penalty all matters are taken into account, an important matter to bear in mind in this sentencing exercise is that Mr Morgan asked for the matter that I earlier referred to to be taken into account on a Form 1. It was substantial offending. As I pointed out in my judgment on 12 December 2013 I was not required to measure the extent to which that matter on the Form 1 affected the otherwise appropriate sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	I went through in some detail the general principles that flowed from the guideline judgment of 2002 that I cited in that sentencing exercise. But it must be fairly said that if Mr Morgan was to appear in court in relation to the offence on the Form 1 standing alone the likelihood would be that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Putting aside the seriousness of the offending, and seeking to recruit someone to give him, in effect, a false alibi, he maintained that situation - if I could call it that - for a number of months. It was not as if he recruited someone and then recanted within a very short period of time. I took all of those maters into account when sentencing him.
	
	
	Of course, as I have just pointed out, at least in passing, by taking into account a matter on the Form 1, it increases the sentence that would otherwise be required for the principal offence. It could be fairly said that for this prisoner, because of his criminal history, greater weight in the context of s 3A matters should be placed upon personal deterrence, and the way in which that matter is understood from the High Court judgment of Veen (No 2) v R. It could be fairly said that the objective gravity of the prisoner’s offending is greater than that of Mr Morgan, albeit marginally in all the circumstances. Those matters must be weighed against the increase upon the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon Mr Morgan by reason of the matter on the Form  .
	
	
	The other feature of this matter of some importance is what could be called, through the able submissions of his counsel, the progress in the rehabilitation of the offender. Of course promoting an offender’s rehabilitation is one of the many purposes of sentencing that I am required to take into account in sentencing in every exercise. As the High Court of Australia in Veen (No 2) pointed out, when it identified four of the seven or eight purposes of sentences that have since been enshrined in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the purposes of sentencing are guideposts that sometimes point in the opposite direction. I propose to give credit to the prisoner’s endeavours over the last period of time since released from custody to address some of the issues that have bedevilled him in his life, particularly a history of polydrug abuse, a contributing factor it would seem to his offending on this occasion, as it was for Mr Morgan and Mr Van Kool, and attempts to stabilise his domestic circumstances.
	
	
	These matters speak in the context of what could be called s 21A matters which I, in my rush, did not spend a great deal of time analysing back in December 2013. The recognition of findings pursuant to s 21A(3) amongst mitigating factors, other than those that would otherwise be available from the material, is a conclusion that the prisoner has demonstrated, albeit that there are question marks about his drug use and there certainly are questions about his problematic drinking, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	His ability to avoid offending for a start since August 2012 is an important matter given his history of offending in the two or three years before that. Of course, it goes without saying that the community will not give him a pat on the back as such for doing what he should be doing. The community expects its citizens to conduct themselves in an orderly fashion for the welfare of everybody. But it must be recognised that many people, once they start on a course of offending, have a great deal of difficulty stopping, sometimes because the fundamental contributing factors to their offending are not addressed.
	
	
	The prisoner has sought to address some of these matters, as the reports made clear, and although - in my view - he has not been entirely successful to this point there are indications that he has made progress, and that progress should be recognised.
	
	
	If I could just turn to the evidence that is particular to him, as opposed to the evidence that was particular to the co-accused, at the moment - this prisoner has been the subject of assessment by the Probation and Parole Service, which reflects upon his family background and his history of, as I have described it, “polydrug use”, extending back to his teenage years. It is a common factor through the offending of this prisoner with his co-accused that on the night in question, that is the night before the commission of the offence in the early hours of the morning, the offender was affected by, and had used Xanax tablets, and had been abusing Xanax for some period of time.
	
	
	Since his release from custody - to which I have earlier made mention - the prisoner has sought drug and alcohol counselling on a voluntary basis. Contact by the Probation and Parole Service with the Hornsby Area Health Service in June 2013 confirms that engagement, and the prisoner has completed what is called the Getting SMART Program at the Hornsby District Office of that program on 1 October 2013.
	
	
	In July 2013 he completed another course described as Managing Emotions, described as a self-development training program. Again it is to his credit that he has undertaken these matters voluntarily.
	
	
	I point out just in passing that by the time I came to deal with Mr Morgan and Mr Van Kool they, having been on bail for some period of time, breached their bail conditions and found themselves in custody. Hence the reality of the situation that their custody had effectively commenced before I actually imposed sentence on them. There was, in that fact and other matters, suggestions of a lack of success, or some lack of success, on each of their parts to address matters that would progress their rehabilitation.
	
	
	The prisoner’s addressing of some of these fundamental matters go to significant issues that have contributed to his offending over a period of time. His inability to control his temper - that is the way I would express it - rather than controlling his emotions, his inability in effect to control his aggression, and of course his dependence on drugs and his abuse of drugs over a period of time.
	
	
	The Probation and Parole Service concluded that his history of violent offences was a matter of concern. I have not forgotten the level of threat that he offered to the vulnerable victim in this matter. But the Probation and Parole Service noted that he had displayed insight into his offending behaviour, and had noted the connected between his use of prohibited drugs and its impact upon his decision making skills. He is thought to be assessed as at a medium risk of re-offending.
	
	
	He had been co-operative with the Probation and Parole Service. He has what is said to be the steadying influence of his partner, which I accept, and he has the incentive of his partner’s forthcoming delivery of their child. Of course I pause for a moment to point out that that relationship did not stop him offending on this night. Nor has it stopped him offending over the last several years before August 2012. But the Probation and Parole Service acknowledges that the prisoner has taken on greater responsibility for his relationship with his partner, and understood the importance of it giving the current pregnancy, which obviously has arisen since he was charged with this offence.
	
	
	The offender is said by the Probation and Parole Service to “display insight into his offending behaviour”, and that he would benefit from a period of supervision, particularly monitoring drug and alcohol, and mental health matters. In that regard I have a report from a consultant psychiatrist who had seen the offender, referred by the family doctor, over a period of time between January 2012, which obviously pre-dates this offender, until 3 December 2013. The diagnoses of the psychiatrist are that:
	


“He has experienced adversity in childhood resulting in socio-cultural and behavioural problems. He has had a depressive illness. He has been through substance abuse” - I am using the words of the doctor, I hasten to say - “he has been diagnosed with paranoid psychosis which may be drug/substance induced, or may be an underlying psychosis (schizophrenic) illness.”


	
	He has been treated with antidepressant and anti-psychotic medication. This report is dated 7 December 2014.
	
	
	In the submissions ably put on the prisoner’s behalf by his counsel, it is noted that there has been a subsidence of psychotic episodes corresponding with the subsidence in the abuse of prohibited drugs, particularly amphetamine styled substances which obviously, along with prescription drugs, have psychotic consequences. There is, as I said in the course of submission, some empirical evidence of the fact that the psychoses that the prisoner has displayed in the past may or probably have their origin in drug abuse rather than an underlying mental illness such as schizophrenia. I note that in the evidence available to me, there is no suggestion when the prisoner is not affected by prescribed drugs or prohibited drugs that he has difficulty functioning or displays symptoms consistent with an underlying chronic mental illness.
	
	
	In relation to the psychologist’s report, I have taken that into account as well. It is a thorough document. It provides some detail as to his background. It notes difficulties throughout his education but many of these difficulties were associated with conduct problems in his teen years marked usually by substance abuse and violent activity. He did not apply himself in any event due to lack of interest at school and left school at the end of year 10.
	
	
	The report noted that he had left home by the time he was 17, moving out to live with his now partner and her family and that relationship has existed for five years, over a period of time as I have pointed out that the prisoner has been offending. I have pointed out also as the history reveals in the report that his first child is due shortly, March 2014. His partner is described in the report as “pro social” with no history of criminality or substance abuse and this is a matter hopefully that might provide some stability for the prisoner in the future.
	
	
	Most of his issues, however, have arisen in terms of his offending out of his drug use and it is interconnected relationship with his choice of peers and associates. I think when it is all analysed with no disrespect to Mr Morgan and Mr Van Kool who, as I have pointed out, do not have as significant criminal histories as this offender, the offending with which I am concerned in this robbery in company very much speaks of the consequences of peer behaviour when all three participants have some history to varying degrees of antisocial activity and drug dependence.
	
	
	I have dealt with the issue of his drug usage since his teenage years and his use of amphetamines as well as his abuse of prescription drugs. I accept that the offender before the commission of this offence had for a number of months being abusing Xanax but it would appear to me of course that he well knew the consequences of abuse of prohibited drugs or prescribed drugs. Of course, as the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1996) 46 NSWLR 346 held, particularly in the judgment of Wood J but with the agreement of the Chief Justice and other Judges, drug dependency and use is not a mitigating factor, nor could it be in circumstances where people voluntarily abuse drugs with the knowledge of the consequences as surely this prisoner must have given his prior anti social behaviour.
	
	
	That having been said, Wood J, in a separate judgment from the Chief Justice, made observations with which most of the other judges agreed, and pointed out at [273] the ways in which acquiring funds to support a drug habit or committing a crime out of a state of drug dependency may still be relevant in sentencing. It may be relevant to the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of planning. Such is the case here. There is, as I pointed out in the facts earlier summarised in the other sentencing exercise, the fact the prisoner and his colleagues went to another person’s house, apparently an alarm was engaged and they fled.  The planning was minimal, and also to my mind the state of mind or capacity of this offender to exercise judgment was inhibited. That having been said, the sentencing of offenders does not permit of a so-called “drunk’s charter” where people commit serious crimes affected by drugs can expect to be excused.
	
	
	I have taken into account what Wood J has said at [273] in the way that I have identified in relation to the objective facts and I also note what his Honour said further about the relevance of drug dependency to the subjective circumstances, particularly upon the prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation and some special considerations that might arise if a person may be at 'the crossroads'.
	
	
	The psychological assessment of the offender notes a history of childhood depressive symptoms, the treatment for psychotic episodes and treatment with antipsychotic and antidepressant medication including whilst he was in custody. The fact that the prisoner is engaged with a psychologist is to his credit. The psychologist administered a number of standard tests which are applied by psychologists and came to the conclusion that in terms of matters relating to the clinical symptoms and personality, a profile of the offender, he reflected distress levels associated with his concern about his approaching sentencing and likely incarceration but the result did not indicate the presence of a major mental illness.
	
	
	No cognitive testing was undertaken, but it was thought that he had functional intelligence, displaying adequate reading skills, spelling and written expression across a couple of “crude measures” that were undertaken. His history of drug dependency and abuse is noted and as has been pointed out by the learned Crown Prosecutor, whilst he has largely ceased prescription and prohibited drug use, he seems to be still abusing alcohol on occasions and regularly drinking alcohol on other occasions and admitted recent use of cocaine, although from what I understand of the history he gave and it’s to his credit that he was prepared to concede this. It might never have been discovered otherwise. He has not been involved in systematic or regular drug use.
	
	
	The psychologist made the conclusion that his background was through schooling and other factors less than advantageous. His functioning has been compromised as a result of multiple substance abuse and his offending has largely occurred in this context. He impressed as being at risk for emerging psychotic phenomena either through developing paranoid ideation or through drug relapse and that he needs to cease abuse of alcohol at hazardous levels. His incarceration will have some effect upon that. He is at high risk of drug relapse and hence the opportunity to undertake such programs as available within the custodial setting will be offered to him I trust although I have no control over that.
	
	
	He has never participated in intensive drug and alcohol rehabilitation despite the fact that his previous incarcerations would suggest in the context of the offending that brought them about the need for that to occur. I have already pointed out, however, as the psychologist notes, he has taken positive changes and she said that he appeared “motivated to make positive changes” from what had been “his previous drug abusing trajectory”, the birth of his child being one such motivating factor.
	
	
	It was recommended that he undertake supervision, perhaps rehabilitation programs on his release from parole. That will be entirely a matter for the Parole Authority. He does need assistance in relation to mental health counselling and treatment given past treatment by a psychiatrist and counselling from a psychologist. That is referred to in the report as “Mr Cavill” but who I am informed is Mr Ross “Calvi”. He also needs continuing strategies around anger management which is self evident from his criminal history of violence.
	
	
	I have already referred to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It follows from what I foreshadowed to the prisoner as to the sentence to be imposed, I have made a finding that there are special circumstances pursuant to that section. In my view, the offender needs an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living to receiving professional assistance in relation to preventing drug and alcohol abuse relapse and also to receive professional guidance in relation to treatment of his mental health and other psychological issues as well as assisting him to address anger management.
	
	
	In sentencing the offender, obviously I have regard to the guideline judgment in Henry as I did on the occasion in the other sentencing exercise. I make specific reference to the criteria that were identified by the learned Chief Justice as being common criteria in the commission of offences summarised in [162] and the matters that were relevant to Mr Morgan are obviously relevant here. Although the prisoner had been in gaol before, I am prepared to conclude that his criminal history was one that did not aggravate the offending in the sense that it was an aggravating factor under s 21A(2) Crimes(Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I pointed out in the earlier judgment, of course, that there may be other factors which will arise in addition to the matters set out at [162] and they were identified by the learned Chief Justice at [170]. These are so-called aggravating factors, rather than those under s 21A which did not exist at the time of the Henry decision. Matters such as the intensity of the threat as occurred in this matter and the number of offenders involved in the commission of the offence and the like.
	
	
	The general observations I have made about Henry pertinent to Mr Morgan can fairly be applied to this case.
	
	
	I have taken into account all the submissions that have been put. Counsel for the prisoner has skilfully taken me to the material that he relies upon, much of which I have already cited. I accept by reference to the terms perhaps of s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that this is an offence with little planning, certainly not sophisticated planning.
	
	
	In relation to the other mitigating factors that arise, the plea of guilty is a mitigating factor. I believe the prisoner has shown remorse, particularly, even though he did not give evidence, by the steps that I have already outlined taken to seek assistance in an understanding, or with insight, as to the reasons for his offending. Clearly the prisoner is not a person of good character and of course I could not conclude that he was unlikely to re-offend without taking further steps to avoid abuse of alcohol and the use of drugs, whether they be prescription or prohibited drugs.
	
	
	His counsel in his submissions drew my attention as I have already noted to the history of polydrug abuse and the contributing factor of drug abuse to the commission of the offence and place much reliance upon the reports to which I have made reference, particularly the report of the psychologist, Ms Collins.
	
	
	He is still it can be fairly said a relatively young man. He is 22 now. He is slightly older than the other offenders but they would appear really to be “peers” at the time of the commission of the offence and I have already analysed the submissions that were made about the issue of parity.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to features of the matter that I have acknowledged in the course of the remarks I have made. The Crown conceded that it was a matter where a finding of special circumstances could be made. The Crown noted the steps taken by the prisoner in the progress of his rehabilitation and the distinction that might be drawn in that regard between he and Mr Morgan. The Crown noted, as I have noted, that Mr Morgan had less significant criminal history but then again as I said earlier, the Form 1 matter loomed large in his sentencing exercise to enhance what would be the otherwise appropriate sentence for the principal offence.
	
	
	A sentence is not an exercise that leads to mathematical precision. There will always be varying factors in every sentencing exercise that I knowledge arise in this matter, particularly when one compares two offenders, even two offenders involved in the same joint criminal enterprise. Ultimately it is a question of determining what the justice of the situation demands and in this particular case, if Mr Morgan had absent the matter on the Form 1, the justice of the situation would have demanded that a greater sentence be imposed upon this prisoner.
	
	
	The presence of the matter on the Form 1 which I hasten to say, although it follows as a matter of logic, was an offence committed after the commission of the principal offence by definition and was related to the principal offence, it significantly balances the ‘equation’, if that is the correct expression, that is to be addressed involving the comparison of the competing features of the case of this prisoner as against that of Mr Morgan. I hasten to say, of course, this prisoner’s criminal history would have been a proper basis for distinguishing him from Mr Morgan absent the matters I have already acknowledged.
	
	
	Of course, the factors that go to the question of the fixing of the non parole period will, as I have pointed out, significantly vary between offenders. But again ultimately, on consideration of all the matters, the non-parole period for this offender should reflect the same adjustment of that period to the balance of sentence that I accorded Mr Morgan.
	
	
	Hoping that I have taken into account all that has been put before me in the submissions and the evidence, I will move to sentence. Mr Weymark, if you could please stand.
	
	
	In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of two years. That will commence taking into account the period of time you previously spent in custody on 1 January 2014. It will expire on 31 December 2015. I cannot direct that you be released to parole because that will be a matter for the parole authority. The balance of the sentence will be two years. The balance of sentence will expire on New Year’s Eve, 31 December 2017.
	
	
	I do not propose to fix any conditions for your parole. That will again be a matter for the parole authority but they will have regard to my remarks on sentence - you can take a seat, thanks very much- in the usual way.
	
	
	Yes?
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: Just with regards to the recommendation for the compulsory drug treatment.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: What do you say is the way in which I should go about it?
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: Your Honour needs to be satisfied that he appears to be an eligible convicted offender which means he has been sentenced to a non parole period between 18 months and three years and he has been convicted of at least two other offences in the past five years, he has not been convicted of some specified offences, attempt murder, sexual assault, fire arm or supply and manufacture offences, that he resides in the metropolitan Sydney. 
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: He does.
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: And that he is over the age of 18. Your Honour being so satisfied, your Honour then refers him to the Parramatta Drug Court for assessment for the compulsory drug treatment.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Just bear with me. There is a formality I need to - I hear what you say. Just hold that word there. I have heard everything that you said and I accept up until the current point, he satisfies all the relevant criteria. I am sorry, Mr Weymark, I will just have to trust you to sit there. Just be patient. I will have to get Corrective Services to take you downstairs in a moment. Yes, thank you, I’m sorry, yes.
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: Your Honour then refers him to the Parramatta Drug Court.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes. Any objection to that, Madam Crown?
	
	
	GOODWIN: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: It’s a matter of course for the Drug Court, not for me but I am more than prepared to refer him to the Drug Court in those circumstances. The order would be expressed as having been satisfied that he satisfies all the criteria for the compulsory drug treatment program.
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: As an eligible convicted offender.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: As an eligible - satisfies all the criteria for the compulsory drug treatment program as an eligible convicted offender.
	
	
	KRISENTHAL: Thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Mr Weymark, I am going to recommend, as your counsel has asked, that you be referred to the compulsory drug treatment program. I think that is held out at Parklea isn’t it?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yeah.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: But you will have to go to the Drug Court. There is another judge there that presides over the Drug Court. He will make a decision about your case. They probably will ask for my judgment in order to do that but the order will note that you satisfy all the eligibility criteria for the program and in those circumstances I recommend that you be considered for assessment for the compulsory drug treatment program as an eligible convicted offender. I have said that twice. I am hoping my Associate has written all that down and I will sign the order accordingly.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you. Just wait there, Mr Weymark, hopefully people in uniform will come rushing in here in a moment. Do you want to say goodbye to your partner before you leave? Ma’am, you can come forward and just say goodbye to Mr Weymark. You will see him again of course. You will see him no doubt in a few days time. Corrective Services will not allow this to happen. Just take a seat, gentlemen, I will be with you in one moment. Thanks for coming up. Thank you, Mr Weymark.
	
	
	Gentlemen from Corrective Services, I have just sentenced Mr Weymark - just take a seat - to four years imprisonment with a two year non-parole period to start on 1 January because of prior custody and I have recommended that he be forwarded in due course to the Drug Court for consideration for treatment in the compulsory drug treatment program. I am signing the orders in a moment but he has been on bail in recent months. He is now remanded in custody, of course, and I will leave him in your tender care, thank you. He has been waiting patiently. Thank you, Mr Krisenthal for your assistance and thank you, Ms Clarke, nice to see you again. Thank you, Madam Crown for your assistance during the afternoon.

		17 November 2015",2014-02-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763263,R v Russell [2014] NSWDC 30,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The matter before me today is a good illustration of the harmful effects that criminal behaviour can have on a large number of innocent people. In this case Stanley Russell attacked the woman with whom he was in a relationship, causing her significant harm. He did this in front of their children leaving them obviously distressed, and also at risk of thinking that violence is an appropriate way to deal with issues that arise in everyday life. On top of that Mr Russell's behaviour has seen him incarcerated, which has caused great distress to his family and particularly his parents, who have already lost one son who tragically died whilst in custody. 

2So Mr Russell's crimes cause great harm to a large number of people. I doubt very much that he appreciates just how serious his behaviour has been and I doubt very much that he fully understands the impact of his offending on those he should be caring for rather than harming. 

3On 2 July 2012 Mr Russell, whilst subject to an apprehended violence order that prevented him being in Mavis Fernando's home, and whilst on conditional liberty, smashed a bong into Ms Fernando's face. It broke causing significant injuries to her. An ambulance was called and one of the children present at the time told the offender to leave, so he did. Ms Fernando was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of the hospital and she underwent surgery that evening. The large lacerations severed two rootlets to a particular nerve on her face. Whilst one was repaired the other was not. She was discharged the following day, but now there is a permanent scar on her face, and what she describes as tingling near her eye. She has been told by a doctor apparently that the prognosis is uncertain and that there is a risk that eventually her eyelid will droop, interfering with her ability of course to see. I described the harm to her as significant, there is the scar, the risk of interference with her eyesight and of course the constant fears that she has, when every episode of tingling makes her worry that her eyesight will be affected. So she is the person most directly harmed by the offender's behaviour, but then, as I have said, he committed this offence in the presence of three children and the friend of one of them. 

4Ms Fernando herself expresses things very well in her victim impact statement. She is concerned about the offender's behaviour impacting on their children. She says, ""I don't want them to think that violence is the way to deal with things"". And then as I mentioned, there are members of his family, in particular his parents. One of their sons, the offender's older brother Edward died when in custody. Not surprisingly they were greatly distressed, and continue to be, at Edwards's death. One can only imagine the fear that they must now experience knowing that another son, Stanley, is in custody and, because of the seriousness of his offending, must remain there for some time. Does the offender appreciate this? Does he appreciate how he has harmed large numbers of his family? Well I doubt it, but it is something I trust he will reflect upon in years to come.

5The offender grew up in Walgett. He was asked to leave school in Year 7. He then came to Sydney and lived with various aunties and uncles, but the most important aspect is that he commenced using drugs and alcohol.

6 He was in custody himself when Edward died. He was distressed at only receiving permission to attend Edward's funeral shortly before it took place and the inability to associate with members of the family in the immediate time after the funeral had concluded. His drug use escalated significantly after Edward's death and it has been problems with drugs and alcohol that have led the offender to commit a number of crimes including the one for which he must now be sentenced. 

7The R v Fernando [1999] NSCCA 66 principles are of full application in the present case. Quite clearly if the offender continues to use drugs and abuse alcohol once he is released from custody he will continue to commit crimes and continue to go to gaol. 

8A psychologist's report tendered today suggested that the offender's personality changed whilst intoxicated. Given the fact that the offender must well know that his personality changes whilst he is intoxicated, the fact that he was intoxicated on this occasion means that there was not any mitigation at all. This was a serious crime, it caused significant harm, it occurred in the home of the victim in front of their children and involved the use of a weapon, albeit one grabbed opportunistically. 

9I have taken into account in determining the appropriate length of sentence in this case that prison will be particularly hard for the offender, given what happened to his older brother. I have also taken into account hardship to third parties, namely the offender's parents. It is rare indeed that hardship to third parties is taken into account, that hardship must be exceptional but it must be awful for the offender's parents to see Stanley in gaol, given what happened to Edward. 

10In this case personal deterrence must play a large part in the sentence to be imposed upon the offender. He has truly limited insight into the effect of his crimes on those around him. He therefore needs to be made aware in very concrete terms that he too will suffer if he abuses alcohol, uses drugs and therefore commits crimes. General deterrence must also play a significant part. 

11The maximum penalty for the offence which Mr Russell must be sentenced is seven years imprisonment. It carries with it a standard nonparole period of three years. I have taken both the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period into account in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence. 

12The offender pleaded guilty, not at the earliest opportunity but not at the latest opportunity either. The circumstances were that he offered to plead guilty, shortly before a trial was to be held, to a lesser charge than that which the Crown wished to proceed upon at that stage. The Crown would not accept that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. The trial was vacated for unrelated reasons and at the commencement of the subsequent trial the offer to plea guilty to the lesser charge was renewed and this time it was accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment. In those circumstances I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon the offender by 15% to reflect utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. 

13As well as sentencing Mr Russell for that matter I must also sentence him for contravening the AVO, that charge appears on a s 166 certificate. Given the close relationship between the two offences he will receive no extra punishment for having contravened the AVO. I take into account in making that decision also that the statement of facts specifically records at the time of the offence, and thus the time of the breach of the AVO, the offender was with Ms Fernando with her consent. 

14The offender has been in custody for some time now. Part of that is because he is bail refused on these matters but part also is because he served a sentence for unrelated matters. In order to reflect the pre sentence custody specifically relating to this matter I will start the sentence I am about to impose upon Mr Russell from 1 June 2013. I acknowledge that the principal of totality applies in relation to the fact that Mr Russell has served a sentence and been in continuous custody for some time. I have take that principal of totality into account in deciding the length of the sentences I will now impose upon him.

15 There are clearly special circumstances in this case and the most obvious of course is the continuous period of custody, but there is a need for supervision upon Mr Russell being released from prison. Mr Fraser expressed it well when he said there is also a need for a stick as well as a carrot. Mr Russell must know that a breach of parole, most obviously through further offending or drug use, will see him going back to custody with all the terrible consequences that that entails. 

16For the offence on the indictment of reckless wounding, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 1 June 2013 and a head sentence of five years. The non-parole period will expire on 31 December 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. The charge under s 166 certificate I impose a sentence of imprisonment of six months fixed term to date from 1 June 2013. It is my strong recommendation that Mr Russell be allowed to serve his sentence as close as possible to his parents in Walgett.

		15 April 2014",2014-02-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763265,R v Cordell; R v Petersen [2014] NSWDC 74,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing two men who were involved in a shocking home invasion back in 2011. I am sentencing one of the men for four crimes which he committed during the course of that home invasion. I am sentencing the other man for two crimes committed during the home invasion. The two crimes committed by the other man are the same two crimes involving the same victim as two of the crimes committed by the first man. The first man is named Dean Petersen and the second man's name is Ricky Cordell. 

2It is first appropriate to set out the crimes that I am sentencing these men for. Mr Petersen is the man who committed four crimes. Those four crimes are these. The first is assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. The victim was Mr Sciberras. That is an offence against s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament has fixed a maximum of 7 years to that crime. The second offence is another assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. This time the victim was Mr Sciberras' partner, Ms Karakizos. Again that crime carries 7 years' imprisonment under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act. The third crime is called detain with intention to steal property in company. The victim of that crime was Ms Karakizos's daughter, Ms McMaster. That is an offence against s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. Parliament regards that crime so seriously that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment to the offence. The last crime that I am sentencing Mr Petersen for is called use an offensive weapon with intention to commit an act of indecency. Again the victim was Ms McMaster. That offence is created by the Crimes Act, s 33B(1)(a). Parliament has fixed a maximum of 12 years' imprisonment to that offence. 

3When I am sentencing Dean Petersen for the last offence, he has asked me to take into account another offence, namely inciting the same victim, Ms McMaster, to commit an act of indecency towards Dean Petersen. Mr Petersen and the prosecutor have signed a form in accordance with s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) containing that request. I will take that crime into account when I am sentencing Mr Petersen for the last offence and I sign the form to that effect. 

4In two of the crimes committed by Mr Petersen, Ricky Cordell joined him. He was a co-offender. Those two crimes were the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company against Ms Karakizos and the detention with intention to steal property in company committed against Ms McMaster. He was a co-offender in the sense of being engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Petersen. The offences committed by Mr Cordell are committed against the same provisions of the Crimes Act and carry the same maximum sentences. 

5Mr Petersen pleaded guilty to all of the offences that he was charged with. He pleaded guilty on 10 April 2013, some 9 months after he was committed for trial. 

6As was pointed out by Mr S Molloy of counsel who appeared for Mr Petersen, there were some negotiations about the charges that were placed on the indictment and those negotiations resulted in a reduction in the number of offences on the indictment and an agreement between him and the prosecution about what he would plead guilty to. As Mr Molloy pointed out, the negotiations resulted in him being charged with fewer offences than those that he originally faced. In fact, as Mr Molloy pointed out, there were five charges laid by the police in the first place that were eventually not proceeded with. Mr Molloy referred me to the High Court's approval of Ipps J's remarks in Atholwood v The Queen [1999] WASCA 256; 109 A Crim R 465, as stated in Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6; 209 CLR 339; 76 ALRJ 382. I refer to [20 - 22] of the majority judgment in that case. 

7On the other hand Mr D Patch of counsel, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor, argued that the reduced number of charges was no more than a classic example of a plea bargain. He argued that Mr Petersen should receive no more than a 10% discount for his plea, whereas Mr Molloy argued that it should be closer to 15%. 

8I think there is some force in both submissions and I propose eventually to discount the sentences that Mr Petersen will receive by 12% because of the fact that he has pleaded guilty.

9On the other hand, Mr Cordell went to trial on four charges and was found not guilty of two of the charges. I am sentencing Mr Cordell for the two offences that the jury found him guilty of on 24 February 2013. If I have not already done so, I formally convict Mr Cordell of the two offences that I am sentencing him for. Because there was no plea of guilty by Mr Cordell, he does not have the advantage of the discount which is offered to a person who has pleaded guilty to an offence. 

10A judge needs to make findings about what happened in the course of offences so that those findings can be the basis of the sentences which are imposed. In this case there is in exhibit SF an agreement between the prosecution and Mr Petersen about the facts that he was to plead guilty to. In Mr Cordell's case I will sentence him on the basis of the evidence in the trial, but I have a guide provided by Mr Patch as to the findings that I might make, contained in MFI 27. 

11Georgia Karakizos lived at Colyton, a suburb of Sydney. She lived there with her seven children. They were aged from 19 down to 1. She and her partner, Mr Sciberras, who was the father of four of the children, were in the family room. It was in fact a converted garage. It was late at night on 25 September 2011. The children had gone to bed. The children included Justin McMaster. He was the 19-year-old son of Ms Karakizos and lived in a granny flat with his partner. The children also included Kayla McMaster, who was then aged 17 and lived in the main part of the house. 

12It was after midnight when Paul Sciberras and Georgia Karakizos heard a bang on the garage door. Mr Sciberras went out to find out who was there. He said he saw three men in the backyard. The three men, it is agreed, were Dean Petersen, Ricky Cordell and a man named Chris Bailey. There was some conversation about obtaining drugs. 

13In the facts agreed between Mr Petersen and the prosecution, Ricky Cordell produced a chrome-coloured knife and pointed it at Mr Sciberras's throat and told him to get inside the garage. Mr Sciberras did not immediately comply and Dean Petersen punched him in the head four times and then there was a fight amongst the men. Ricky Cordell and Dean Petersen tried to drag Mr Sciberras into the garage. At one stage, according to the facts which are agreed in the Petersen case and which I find in that case, Mr Cordell lunged at Mr Sciberras with a knife and scratched him. Mr Sciberras broke free.

14What I have just described are the findings which I make in respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company committed by Dean Petersen against Paul Sciberras. I make it clear that Mr Cordell has been found not guilty of any assault against Mr Sciberras. 

15Ms Karakizos obviously heard what was going on outside. She was inside, but her partner had not come back into the garage so she went out to look for him. Outside she was confronted by Dean Petersen and Ricky Cordell. One of them asked for money. She tried to get away to run to her neighbour's house for help, but Dean Petersen followed her and grabbed her by the hair. He started to drag her back towards the house. She was struck to her head by something metal by Dean Petersen. She was calling out for help. 

16I find those facts in respect of both men for the assault in company against Georgia Karakizos, but I add in respect of Ricky Cordell that there is evidence, which I accept, that he was standing some 1½ to 2 metres away. Indeed in exhibit S5 Ms Karakizos indicated that Mr Cordell had done no more than stand there and watch without touching her. 

17Kayla McMaster came out of the main part of the house. What she saw was her mother on the ground and Dean Petersen standing over her and kicking her. She asked Dean Petersen who he was and he said ""give me your money"". She said she did not know what he meant. At that point Dean Petersen commenced to commit the offence of detaining Kayla McMaster with intention to steal property in company. He grabbed her and put a knife to her throat. He then took her into the house. He took her through the house, back to the garage. He then walked her back into her mother's bedroom. 

18At that stage I am satisfied that Ricky Cordell was in that room. In other words, Mr Petersen's engagement in this offence commenced before Mr Ricky Cordell's offence. Like the assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company against Kayla McMaster's mother, Mr Petersen was the principal offender. 

19When they got into her mother's bedroom, Ricky Cordell was there looking for money. Dean Petersen demanded the money from her. She said she would have to go and look. Ricky Cordell said ""just tell me where it is and then we'll just go."" As Mr Patch pointed out, those words indicated that Mr Cordell was at that stage an active participant in the detention by making a demand on the victim. 

20While they were still in her mother's bedroom, Dean Petersen let Kayla McMaster go in order for her to look for money. At that point Mr Cordell found a jar of coins. Again, as Mr Patch pointed out, that indicated his active participation in the offence by being responsible for the location of some money, no doubt not what they were looking for, and its theft. 

21At this point Dean Petersen approached his victim, Kayla McMaster, with the knife again. Again he took control of her and made her go into her bedroom. He demanded a phone that he saw in that room. At that point Ms Karakizos' eldest child, Justin McMaster, came into the house. He saw some of what was going on and recognised Dean Petersen from around the neighbourhood. He said ""Dean, what are you doing?"" Dean Petersen denied that that was his name but, significantly, told Justin McMaster to go and find some money ""or she's gone"". 

22Justin McMaster went looking for some money, but came back reporting that he had found none. He went out to the front door and was confronted by Ricky Cordell, who ordered him back inside, at which stage he was holding a wheel brace, although that itself is not part of any offence committed in respect of Justin McMaster. 

23Again Dean Petersen forced Kayla McMaster on the move yet again. He took her out to the front of house and on to the veranda. He still had the knife. He walked her into the driveway. He started to threaten her. He called her a ""bitch"" and suggested that she suck his cock. He put a knife to her throat. She felt that she could not breathe. Although one of his co-offenders, not Ricky Cordell, told him to stop, he told him to shut up because she was coming with them. He then forced her to the ground. The actions which I have just described by Mr Petersen comprise the factual findings which I make against him for the offence of detain with intention to steal property in company. It will be seen that again Dean Petersen was the principal offender in that regard. Mr Cordell was a co-offender and a couple of times took an active part in the offending by making a demand on Ms McMaster and by taking the jar of coins.

24I turn now to the fourth offence that Mr Petersen has pleaded guilty to. After he had forced Kayla McMaster to the ground, he sat on her legs. He then got off her and said ""open your legs."" He threatened her and told him to show him her ""pussy."" She refused. He repeated the demand holding the knife up to her face. Despite Kayla McMaster begging him, he kept the knife there until she opened her legs and moved her underpants to one side saying ""there is that what you want?"" At that point Mr Petersen put the knife to her inner thigh in an action correctly described by Mr Patch as ""a very serious act of dominating sexual violence."" Fortunately the police were heard to be coming at that stage and the men disappeared. As a result of the behaviour I have just described, Mr Petersen was charged with the offence of using an offensive weapon with intention to commit an act of indecency against Kayla McMaster.

25The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is the Act of Parliament in New South Wales that deals with the sentencing of offenders. In s 21A(2) of that Act, Parliament has listed a number of ""aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence."" A number of those factors are present here. There are more factors present in respect of Mr Petersen. Mr Petersen was on parole at the time that he committed these offences. He was released on parole about a month earlier, having spent 2 years in prison for an armed robbery. Being on conditional liberty is a significant aggravating factor. The justice system allows people to be on bail, on good behaviour bonds and releases them early before their sentence expires from prison so that it can assist in their rehabilitation. Instead of getting on with his rehabilitation, Mr Petersen abused his liberty to commit these shocking crimes.

26In addition, another aggravating factor is that the offence was committed in the home of the victims. Everyone is entitled to feel safe and secure in their own home. The peace being enjoyed by these victims in their home was shockingly violated that night. 

27Mr Petersen already had a criminal record. I have referred to the armed robbery that he committed. It occurred in 2009 and he received a 4 year gaol term. He was released on parole after 2 years on 18 August 2011 and, as I said, committed these offences just over a month later. His record includes a number of entries for offences dealt with in the Children's Court including offences of break and enter, assaulting police, stalking, destroying property and an escape. 

28Mr Molloy argued that the matters in the Children's Court should not be included amongst the aggravating factors because of s 14 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). I think there is some force in that submission because s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act describes the relevant aggravating factor as the offender having ""a record of previous convictions."" Section 14 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act prescribes that in the case of ""a child who has pleaded guilty to, or has been found guilty of, an offence"" the Court shall not ""in respect of any offence, proceed to, or record such a finding as, a conviction in relation to a child who is under the age of 16."" Mr Molloy pointed out that his client turned 16 on 1 March 2007 so that I should not take into account as aggravating features any matters referred to in the Children's Court, dealt with by the Children's Court before then. I propose to accept his submission in that regard.

29There nevertheless remains a common assault and a destroy property and an escape which occurred after he turned 16. Nevertheless I accept Mr Patch's submission that the armed robbery is a significant and relevant conviction. Section 21A(2)(d), which deals with previous convictions, says they are aggravating ""particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences"" 

30The fact that Mr Petersen had a knife when he was detaining Kayla McMaster is also an aggravating feature because it involved the actual use of a weapon. It is not an aggravating feature of the s 33B offence because that offence involves, as part of its definition, the use of a weapon. In respect of the detention though, Mr Patch argued, and I accept, that there are degrees of aggravation with the use of a weapon. This offence not only involved the presence but the use of a weapon to threaten the victim. The weapon was a knife which had a capacity so far as the victim was concerned to inflict very serious bodily injury or death. The use of the weapon was sustained and it was accompanied by threats to kill the victim.

31So far as Mr Cordell is concerned, I take into account in respect of his sentences the fact that he committed these offences in the victims' home and, in respect of the detention offence, that at one stage he had a wheel brace. They are the only two statutory aggravating features relevant to Mr Cordell's case. The injuries to Ms Karakizos are apparent from photographs which are contained in the exhibits. The injury to Mr Sciberras which is relevant to Mr Petersen is shown in a photograph. There was some argument about whether or not Mr Cordell produced the knife first. I am here discussing Mr Petersen's case. I do not regard that issue as a significant one or one that needs resolution by me because once Mr Petersen obtained the knife, its use by him for a sustained period of time overwhelmed any significance of where he obtained it.

32It is obvious, as Mr Patch helpfully acknowledged, that so far as the offending behaviour on that evening was concerned, Mr Petersen was by far the more serious offender. He was charged with and pleaded guilty to two additional offences. If I have not done so already, I take this opportunity to formally convict Mr Petersen of the four offences that I have referred to and I am sentencing him for. In respect of one of the offences, I must take into account an additional offence under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

33In respect of the two offences which are in common between the two offenders, Mr Patch acknowledged and I accept that the criminality of Mr Petersen is significantly greater. Although Mr Cordell participated in the detention actively, his actions were not nearly as serious as those of Mr Petersen who not only physically controlled the victim and moved her from place to place, but was armed with a knife and made the threats.

34In respect of the offence against Ms Karakizos, Mr Cordell was part of the joint criminal enterprise and it was acknowledged by the victim that he was not actively engaged apart from his presence. Of course, as I have already said Mr Petersen was on parole and also had a previous conviction for an armed robbery. 

35Mr Patch fairly acknowledged that I can ignore Mr Cordell's criminal history and I accept that submission. It comprised offences in the Children's Court regarding property and trespass and a resist and in the Local Court for resisting arrest, bad language and property offences. For all of these offences he received good behaviour bonds. 

36It is important for a judge to set forth in the remarks accompanying a sentence what happened and how serious an example of the crimes were committed by the offenders. I have set out what happened and will turn later to the seriousness. It is also important for a judge to set out the personal circumstances and relevant information about the offender. 

37I turn to this now. Mr Petersen is now 22 but is about to turn 23 in about a week's time. He gave evidence in the proceedings and acknowledged that he had been drinking alcohol and taking amphetamines beforehand. Although he denied that he went with the knife or that he was aware a knife was being taken, I put little weight on those denials, not because I necessarily do not accept them but because of the sustained use that he made of the knife once he obtained it. 

38He is of Aboriginal background and has two daughters who are aged about six and about four. He was educated to year 10 and was working full-time before he went into custody. He has made very good use of the time he has had in custody and has undertaken a number of courses which are designed to assist in his rehabilitation. Mr Molloy tendered a number of certificates which became exhibit S8 which I have taken into account and which I accept demonstrate that Mr Petersen has applied himself in prison by undertaking the programs. 

39Mr Patch acknowledged that Mr Petersen's prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. I cannot find that they are good because he committed these offences whilst he was on parole. One of the courses he did over eight months attending every day. He has support from his family who were visiting him in custody. He was brought up by his mother and his father did not appear in his life until he was about seven when he found out that his father was an alcoholic. His father died some 10 years later from an alcohol-related disease. He is the youngest of four children. He has also been working whilst he has been in prison. He expressed his sorrow about what he put the victims through and expressed that to her and her family. I take that reference to include all of the victims. His brother has work for him when he finishes in prison. 

40Mr Molloy called Mr Petersen's mother, Ms Golden, who confirmed that her other son would offer Dean Petersen some work. She has observed significant changes in Dean Petersen since he has been in prison and undertaking the courses. She noticed that he is ""standing on his own two feet as in rehabilitating himself whilst in gaol and not just sitting there waiting for everybody else to help him"". Mr Petersen also wrote a letter which became exhibit 7 expressing his remorse about what had occurred as well as expressing it in evidence. 

41Mr Cordell is the older of the two men. He is still 30 and turns 31 this year. What is significant about Mr Cordell's case is this. About four months after he was arrested he sought bail. He was given bail on condition that he attended the well-known and respected Odyssey House, the drug rehabilitation centre. Overall he spent just short of two years in Odyssey House. I have a lot of material from and about Odyssey House which was tendered in evidence by Mr B Eurell of counsel who appeared for Mr Cordell. I have also heard from one of the Odyssey House staff who was called by Mr Eurell to give evidence on behalf of his client. That witness was Mr Justin Walker who is still mentoring Mr Cordell. Mr Walker pointed out that Mr Cordell had reached level 4 which is a very advanced stage in Odyssey House, carrying a lot of responsibility. He described Mr Cordell as a ""valued member of the community at Odyssey House"" who is also demonstrating that he would be a valuable member of the community outside Odyssey House. 

42There are also reports from Odyssey House which describe Mr Cordell's progress through the various stages in very complimentary terms. He is obviously highly regarded as a successful participant in the very demanding program offered by Odyssey House. I should say in the context of Mr Cordell acknowledging his heavy dependency on illegal drugs and the impact which it had in his life, he has always had steady employment and a number of trade qualifications. His life was completely out of control because of drugs and alcohol when he committed these offences. I should also add that the Community Corrections Section of the Department of Corrective Services have provided some very helpful pre-sentence reports in Mr Cordell's case. As they say, he had a ""long history of substance abuse but at the same time demonstrated a sound work ethic"". 

43He had encountered considerable adversity in his life which included domestic violence when he was growing up. He had a history which included a significant learning disability which was disclosed at school. His drug abuse included alcohol, cannabis and amphetamines as well as heroin and methylamphetamines. It noted that he had clearly demonstrated a long-term serious commitment to his own rehabilitation and regarded him as a low to medium risk of re-offending. 

44Returning to Mr Walker's evidence I asked him about the impact that a full-time prison sentence may have on Mr Cordell. Mr Walker, whose experience in this regard I accept, expressed the opinion that if Mr Cordell ""went back to gaol it would demolish any treatment or any issues that he has worked on or any progress that he has made as an individual up until this stage"". He explained that the environment in prison does not encourage ""the five pillars which we entrench as values in each resident in the program"". He has seen other residents going back into prison and bases his opinion on that experience. 

45There are also a number of references which were tendered by Mr Eurell on behalf of his client, mostly from people linked to Odyssey House but also one from his mother. She described positively her son's adjustment to the Odyssey House program and his success in rehabilitating himself. She said that he is refocusing his life. He has a young son and his partner is pregnant at the moment anticipating another child. His mother has seen ""major improvements"" since he has been in Odyssey House as well as ""his general well-being and health along with his attitude towards others"". 

46I turn now to consider the sentences which I should impose on these two men for the crimes which they have committed. 

47I accept that the criminality of Mr Cordell is significantly lower than the criminality of Mr Petersen and I accept the other features of difference between the two offenders which I have already referred to. There is a significant feature of Mr Cordell's case which I need to refer to. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists the purposes of sentencing. One of the purposes is ""to promote the rehabilitation of the offender"". Other purposes of course include ensuring that the offender is adequately punished and deterring the offender and others, as well as protecting the community and making the offender accountable for their actions and denouncing the conduct and recognising the harm. Mr Patch very fairly pointed out that this is one of the occasionally rare and unusual cases where an offender has made extraordinary efforts in rehabilitating themselves. It demonstrates rehabilitation, in my opinion, of the highest order. Mr Cordell has, as Mr Patch acknowledged, taken control of and redirected his own life and his prospects of rehabilitation are very good. Mr Patch acknowledged that the significance of personal deterrence is less because of the progress of Mr Cordell's rehabilitation and that the interests of society are better served by encouraging his rehabilitation. The need to protect the community is also reduced. 

48Mr Eurell described his client's rehabilitation as spectacular and pointed out the very small number of persons who reach the final stages of the course at Odyssey House. Mr Eurell pointed out that this offending conduct was brought about by the abuse of illegal drugs and that his client has successfully dealt with that cause. 

49The two offences that I am sentencing Mr Cordell for are both serious. Obviously the offence of detaining Kayla McMaster with intention to steal in company is much more serious. In normal circumstances I would regard an appropriate sentence for that more serious offence as being 6 years imprisonment and an appropriate sentence for the other offence, the assault, as being 2 years imprisonment. But because of the extraordinarily encouraging personal features which I have referred to I would regard appropriate sentences as being 3 years for the detention and 1 year for the aggravated assault. I would have accumulated those two sentences by 6 months with the result that the overall sentence would have been 3½ years. However, Mr Cordell spent just over 4 months in full time custody before he was given bail. In addition he spent nearly 2 years in the strict environment of Odyssey House. Although he was at liberty on bail, he voluntarily subjected himself to the physical restrictions of that facility. The Court of Appeal regards that sort of environment as quasi custody. I propose to allow about 14 months of that 22 months as being equivalent to full time custody. Overall I would regard Mr Cordell as having served the equivalent of 1½ years in full time custody. Accordingly, the overall sentence which I will impose upon him is one of 2 years imprisonment. Because of the evidence given by Mr Walker about the effect of full time prison and the importance of continuing his rehabilitation in the community I will shortly order that that sentence be suspended.

50I turn now to Mr Petersen's case. For reasons which I have already explained, his criminality is greater than Mr Cordell's. Mr Molloy also drew my attention, so far as his client was concerned, to the recent judgment of the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALRJ 1022; 302 ALR 192. I regard Mr Petersen's early upbringing as being affected by the kinds of factors referred to in that judgment which can mitigate the sentence which would be otherwise appropriate for any offender. In this case as it happens Mr Petersen is indigenous and it is generally, and appropriately, accepted that these problems are particularly prevalent within indigenous communities. The sentences which I would otherwise impose upon Mr Petersen are mitigated because his moral culpability is likely to be less ""than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred"" in the way that Mr Petersen's were. I am quoting from [40] of the judgment of French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ in Bugmy. It is also the case, as the High Court pointed out at [43], that the ""experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life.""

51Taking into account those factors and the rehabilitation which he has commenced in prison, but nevertheless the seriousness of the crimes which he has committed, I would regard appropriate sentences for the crimes which he committed as these: for the offence against Mr Sciberras, 3 years imprisonment; for the corresponding offence against Ms Karakizos, 3 years imprisonment; for the detention of Ms McMaster, 8 years imprisonment; for the use of the weapon to commit an act of indecency in respect of Ms McMaster, 5 years imprisonment. When one adds those up they come to a total of 19 years imprisonment. However if I were sentencing Mr Petersen individually for each crime I would direct that the sentences for the two crimes committed against Ms McMaster run partially concurrently so that the overall sentence would be 10 years. I would also direct that there be some concurrency between the two offences for the assaults so that they would be in effect 1½ years each. The result still comes to a total of 13 years imprisonment. Because Mr Petersen pleaded guilty I would reduce that term by 12% so that it would result in an overall prison sentence of 11 years imprisonment. At this stage I regard it as important to give particular weight to Dean Petersen's youth. As I said he is about to turn 23. He is still a very young man and I need to be wary of having a young man, such as he is, spend a very long time in prison. What I propose to do is to impose an overall sentence of 9 years imprisonment and to fix a non-parole period of 4½ years imprisonment.

52Mr Petersen when he was arrested for this offence on 30 October 2011 went back into custody but, as I explained, he was on parole when he committed these offences so when he went back into custody he had to serve the balance of that parole. He did not finish serving that sentence until 21 September 2013. Mr Molloy argued and Mr Patch acknowledged that in accordance with what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145, I may take into account the principle of totality and backdate the sentence somewhat that I am imposing rather than direct that it commence on 22 September 2013. I propose to backdate that sentence by 9 months so that it commences on 21 January 2013. 

53What I propose to do in respect of Mr Petersen is to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of the four offences that I am sentencing him for. As I said, I would have regarded appropriate sentences for the two McMaster offences as 8 years and 5 years and the two assaults as 3 years each. I would have directed some concurrency so that the overall result would be 13 years imprisonment but I would have reduced that to 11 years after a discount for pleading guilty. But because of his youth I would have imposed sentences with an overall effect of 9 years imprisonment.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Petersen, I am going to sentence you now if you would stand up, please. 

54I impose an aggregate sentence of 9 years imprisonment in respect of the offences that you have committed. The non-parole period will be 4½ years. The sentence will commence on 21 January 2013. The overall sentence of 9 years will therefore expire on 20 January 2022. The non-parole period of 4½ years commenced on 1 January 2013. It therefore expires on 20 July 2017. The first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 20 July 2017. The balance of your sentence of 4½ years is from 21 July 2017 to 20 January 2022. You have a seat, Mr Petersen. 

55There is one other matter I have to deal with regarding Mr Petersen and that is this. There was evidence given by Mr Petersen that he was interested in the violent offenders program at Parklea but that there needed to be a recommendation from a judge for him to undertake it. I recommend to the Commissioner of Corrective Services that, if he considers it appropriate, Mr Petersen be allowed to undertake the violent offenders program at Parklea.

56In respect of Mr Cordell I have indicated that the sentence I would have imposed in respect of the detention was 3 years imprisonment and the sentence that I would have imposed in respect of the assault was 1 year imprisonment and that I would have accumulated them or rather I would have directed that they be served concurrently to the extent of 3½ years imprisonment. I would have taken into account in effect 1½ years for pre-sentence custody therefore resulting in an effective sentence of 2 years imprisonment. I propose to impose an aggregate sentence in respect of those two offences. 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Cordell, if you would stand up.

57In respect of the two offences that you have committed I impose an aggregate sentence of 2 years imprisonment. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for the period of 2 years. The conditions of your good behaviour bond are that you accept supervision from the Community Corrections Section of the Corrective Services Department and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions from an officer of that office, particularly regarding issues of companions and drug and alcohol problems. Have a seat, Mr Cordell.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Papanis, Mr Cole, Ms Fard, first are there any matters of law or fact that might be dealt with under s 43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, errors or misdescriptions or things like that, anyone?

PAPANIS: Not necessarily a s 43 matter but one that would exercise the power under I think it's 167 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Mr Cordell when he was arrested a small amount of marijuana on his person. I hand up a s 166 certificate, I've given my friend a copy of that as a related offence. Given your Honour's approach to sentence and Mr Cordell's progress with the Odyssey House program I wouldn't make any submission on it except to recommend that that be dealt with with the matters that your Honour has just sentenced him on. I do have the fact sheet if that assists but it only goes so far as to say that when Mr Cordell was arrested he had a small amount of marijuana on him.

HIS HONOUR: So what do you want me to do? What is it, s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act?
PAPANIS: I believe it's 167, your Honour, I don't have the law in front of me at the moment I'm afraid.
HIS HONOUR: Is this a backup charge or related?
PAPANIS: It's a related offence. I have the police facts sheets relating to if it would assist and a charge--
HIS HONOUR: Not yet. What do you suggest I do?
PAPANIS: It would be within your discretion to have it incorporated into the suspended sentence if your Honour were minded that way or to my friend may wish to seek a--
HIS HONOUR: No, I'm going to give him a s 10A. It really pales into insignificance.
PAPANIS: I meant to indicate for there to be no heavy penalty on that one.
HIS HONOUR: Say that again?
PAPANIS: I meant to indicate to your Honour to not deal with it in any heavy way. It was just a matter that had come up and given that it's a small drug offence and there were the drug issues that he's addressed.
HIS HONOUR: In respect of the related offence of you don't need to be heard on that.
PAPANIS: I don't want to be heard.
HIS HONOUR: Which is the subject of MFI 28 possessing a prohibited drug. 

58Under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I convict Mr Cordell and dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty. 

COLE: I have one other matter. 
FARD: I don't have anything to add.
HIS HONOUR: Any other conditions so far as your client is concerned? Probation and Parole, Odyssey House says that he should, it just says that after care programme based in a geographical area. 
FARD: My client is happy with those conditions. 
HIS HONOUR: Do you or Ms Papanis think that I need to do anything more?
PAPANIS: Not so much a matter relating to the s 12 but I notice on the last occasion there was still the two addresses that were indicated in his bail variation so unless I understand he's now living in Jamisontown so I just wanted to maybe see if he's still living at that address.
HIS HONOUR: Are you still at Jamisontown?
OFFENDER CORDELL: Yes.

59The conditions are the one I have already directed to accept directions and recommendations. The second condition is that he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address. The third condition is that he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so. 

HIS HONOUR: Anything else in respect of Mr Cordell?

Mr Cordell, you have heard what I have had to say. You need to go with Ms Fard to the Registry to sign the bond. Ms Fard will explain to you this. A s 12 bond, a suspended sentence. You have got a suspended sentence. So you have to understand that you have got a 2 year gaol sentence but I have suspended it but it is still hanging there. Normally if you get a good behaviour bond and you breach it by doing something wrong you come back before the Court and a judge or magistrate might say that is fair enough, just go back and keep trying but with a suspended sentence it is different. It is quite different. If you get into trouble and you come back, the law about suspended sentences makes it very hard for the judge not to send you to gaol. So if you get into trouble again for anything and you come back before me or you mess up on your supervision and you come back before me my hands are tied. It is really important, Ms Fard will explain it to you again, that you understand that. Otherwise you have spent the last 2 years getting on with your life and not only that but really turning yourself around. I congratulate you. Keep up the good work. Just wait until Ms Fard accompanies you to the Registry.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Cole, Ms Papanis, the sentence in respect of Mr Petersen. Any submissions or any corrections?
PAPANIS: No.
COLE: In relation to Mr Petersen, your Honour made a recommendation in terms to Corrective Services in terms of him being allowed to undertake a certain course.
HIS HONOUR: I did. It was based on his evidence.
COLE: I understand that there may be a criterion that if you get more than 3 years fulltime gaol you cannot do that course but I would ask this, would your Honour be prepared to direct that a transcript even if just that portion of the recommendation that your Honour makes be taken out and attached--
HIS HONOUR: Of my sentence? They get it anyway. They ask for it anyway. It goes to Corrective Services.
COLE: I just make sure because sometimes Corrective Services can be a very slow moving - I meant no criticism
HIS HONOUR: When a sentence is over 3 years they ask for a transcript so that the remarks on sentence will go to Corrective Services. Mr Petersen, for reasons that I have explained your sentence is significantly higher but I have also discounted it a lot for the reasons that I explained and in the end a lot because of how young you are. You are still a young man but you did some dreadful things that night as did Ricky Cordell but you were even worse. So you have ended up with a 9 year gaol term. I could have commenced it in September last year but I have backdated it to January, given you 9 months when you were serving both, your balance of parole and this sentence so you have a 9 month start. You are in gaol until 20 July 2017. You are eligible for parole. You know the drill there. I cannot direct parole. It is up to the Parole Authority. They assess you and give you parole but that is when you are first eligible, 20 July 2017. You have got about 3 years and a few months to go. You also made a very good start on your rehabilitation. You have good support from your family and let them keep supporting you and get on with those courses so that when you get out eventually you can resume a life which hopefully which will not be affected in the ways that it has. Your sentence finally expires on 20 January 2022. Do you understand all of that?
OFFENDER PETERSEN: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Good luck. Is there anything else I need to do? I don't think there's anything I need to send, no, into custody with Mr Petersen so far as exhibits usually psychiatric or psychological material. There's none of that. Anything else?
COLE: Not for Mr Petersen.
FARD: We are going to the Registry. I am taking the client--
HIS HONOUR: Thank you. That's important and if you would explain to Mr Cordell again about the s 12 bond I'd be grateful and if you'd accompany him to the Registry so he could be signed up.

2763283,Doyle v R; R v Doyle [2014] NSWCCA 4,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Philip Doyle (the appellant) was arraigned on 38 charges alleging sexual offences committed against five male complainants.

2The appellant was initially tried on these 38 counts and one further count before Judge North and a jury (the first trial). Judge North gave a directed verdict on one count and the jury was otherwise unable to reach a verdict. At his subsequent trial before Judge Woods QC and a jury, the appellant was convicted on all 38 counts. He was sentenced to an overall term of 7 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

3The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sought leave to the extent that it was necessary to do so.

Each of the offences was alleged to have taken place between 12 April 2003 and 20 November 2003.

Outline of the Crown case

15Although it will be necessary to deal with the factual background in relation to some of the charges in more detail when addressing the grounds of appeal, broadly speaking the Crown alleged that each of the complainants were young persons who were befriended by the appellant whilst he was the proprietor of a cinema known as the Kogarah Mecca (the theatre). It was alleged that Mr Lawrence applied for a job at the theatre in early 1980 and worked as a projectionist and an usher on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. The Crown alleged that over time the appellant befriended Mr Lawrence and his family. The appellant was alleged at one stage to have promised Mr Lawrence a car and a vintage projector if he worked at the theatre for two years.

16Mr Lawrence said that a few times the appellant and he went to the appellant's unit at Ozone Street, Cronulla, where they had a sauna or a shower.

17The indecent assaults the subjects of Counts 1 to 3 were alleged to have occurred in the projection booth of the theatre. Mr Lawrence stated that as it was very hot in the booth he would wear only a singlet and underpants under his overalls. Mr Lawrence claimed the appellant came into the booth and slid his hands into the slits behind the pocket flaps of the overalls where he fondled Mr Lawrence's penis. 

18Mr Lawrence ceased to work at the theatre in early 1982.

19PM's sister performed in two pantomimes at the theatre. Between the first pantomime and the second (Hansel and Gretel) PM and his family socialised with the appellant and visited his unit overlooking the beach at Cronulla.

20PM said that he worked as an usher through every performance of Hansel and Gretel. After the pantomime PM began to spend more time with the appellant, although generally in the company of his family.

21In June 1985 PM's father left for a job in Lismore but his family did not join him until about January 1986. PM continued to see movies at the theatre and received some driving lessons from the appellant. PM said that one night when they drove to Kurnell the appellant suggested they could come back when the weather was warmer and that if they did so PM would not need swimming attire because they could swim in the nude.

22PM referred to an incident in July or August 1985 when he had gone to the theatre with friends and was offered cask wine by the appellant. As he did not want his mother to find out that he had been drinking it was agreed that the appellant would ask PM's mother to let PM stay overnight at the appellant's unit.

23After PM's mother agreed, PM stated that he and the appellant went back to the theatre and continued drinking. PM said he became intoxicated. He said that during the journey back to the appellant's unit the appellant touched his penis through his clothing and said something about his ""little dick"". This was the subject of Count 4 in the indictment. 

24PM claimed that when they arrived at the unit the appellant assisted in removing his clothing and slid his underpants off saying, ""You won't be needing those"".

25Thereafter PM said they got into bed and the appellant started to fondle PM's genitals stating, ""this will help us to be better friends"". PM said it hurt and he asked the appellant if there was any form of lubricant. The appellant obtained some baby oil and put it on his hand and on PM's genitals which he continued to fondle. This incident was the subject of Count 5.

26PM said that on the next day he contacted and arranged to meet a friend who he identified as NL. The following day he met NL and told him that something of a sexual nature had occurred involving the appellant. However, PM continued to see the appellant.

27PM said that he had heard of Mr Lawrence's name but had never met him. PM did not recall DL's name and did not remember meeting anyone by that name.

28DL commenced working at the theatre shortly after March 1986. He was given a uniform to try on and he told the appellant that the pants were tight. The appellant checked by feeling the front of DL's pants. He was given a different uniform.

29Initially DL worked Tuesday and Friday nights at the theatre, but later he also worked a shift on Saturday afternoons, mainly during school holidays. The appellant also asked him to come in early on Saturdays to help him with odd jobs. He stated that on occasion the appellant took him to lunch at McDonald's or a Chinese restaurant.

30On Tuesday 5 August 1986 there was a large storm and Salt Pan Creek flooded. DL lived on the other side of the river to the theatre and no traffic could get through, so DL could not be picked up and taken home. DL said he recalled a conversation between himself, the appellant, and Mr Robert Tenant, the theatre manager, in which Mr Tenant offered that he stay at his home. However, the appellant said he would have DL at his place. DL and the appellant arrived at the appellant's Cronulla unit at about 11.00pm.

31DL was told by the appellant that he did not have a spare bed so he would have to sleep in the appellant's bedroom. As DL did not have a change of clothes he got into bed in his underpants. The appellant also got into the bed, also in his underpants and possibly a t-shirt.

32DL's evidence was that the appellant was talking to him and touching him on his arm or leg. Eventually the appellant touched DL's penis on the outside of his underpants, holding his hand there for about 30 seconds. DL said he was in shock and very scared. He said the appellant started to stroke his penis and placed DL's hand on his own penis. DL said that he thought at some stage his underpants were removed by the appellant.

33DL said that the appellant started to masturbate him. DL said his hand was on the appellant's penis and that the appellant was thrusting his hips into DL's hand. DL said this continued for about two hours.

34This incident was the subject of Count 6 in the indictment.

35DL said that in around late September 1986 he went to the appellant's house in Sans Souci. The appellant asked him to pose for photographs. DL said that he would and he was given some Speedos to put on. He said they were too small and made his genitals bulge through his pants. The appellant photographed him around the pool and inside the house and then suggested that they go for a drive to Kurnell around the sand dunes. 

36DL said that whilst they were sitting in the back of the appellant's ute, DL wearing the Speedos and the appellant dressed in Speedos and a t-shirt, the appellant started to touch him on the inside and outside of his Speedos and asked DL to do the same to him. It lasted for about 15 minutes.

37This incident was the subject of Count 7.

38DL said that in around late November or December 1986 the appellant bought him a 10 watt amplifier.

39DL gave evidence that sometime later the appellant asked him if he would like to watch a pornographic movie. DL said that one night shortly thereafter he and the appellant went to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. They then went to the appellant's house and began to watch the film on television whilst seated at the edge of the bed. The appellant asked DL if he would like to masturbate to the film. Each of them removed their pants and masturbated. 

40They then started to masturbate each other. DL continued to masturbate the appellant until he ejaculated onto his stomach. This was the subject of Count 8.

41DL said a similar event to that the subject of Count 8 occurred the following morning, although it did not last as long as the night before. This was the subject of Count 9.

42Count 10 involved a similar incident to that the subject of Counts 8 and 9. DL said the incident occurred on a night in around March or April 1987 at the appellant's home. 

43DL stated that at that time the appellant asked him to kiss his penis, saying words to the effect ""Can you kiss me down there?"" DL said he did so and the appellant then asked him to put it in his mouth. DL said he was unable to do so, the thought of it making him feel very sick. DL said he believed that he and the appellant continued to masturbate each other after that. This incident was the subject of Count 11.

44KM went on a school excursion to the theatre for a screening in around April or May 1989. He said in evidence that some of the other students were ""stuffing about"" and he told them off as he was keen to see the film. KM said the appellant told him that he was impressed with what he had done and asked him whether he was interested in working at the theatre.

45KM said that after discussions between himself, the appellant and his mother, he started to work at the theatre, probably sometime between May and July 1989. He said that while he was trying on his uniform the appellant assisted him and in the course of doing so felt the pants around his waist between his crotch and at times brushed his hands against KM's lower buttocks and crotch entirely on the outside.

46KM said that from time to time after school he went to the theatre and chatted with the appellant. He said that one day in July 1989 the appellant told him he was good looking and he would like to take his photograph. KM said that the appellant told him he would like to see him with his shirt off and to see what he would look like naked. KM said he took his shirt and pants off and was standing in his underwear. He said the appellant then touched him on the chest and around the buttocks and crotch area, encouraged him to take his underpants off and assisted him in doing so.

47KM said that the appellant then began to fondle his penis to a point where he got an erection. KM said that it continued for a little while but he could not recall how it ended. This incident was the subject of Count 12.

48After the theatre closed down at some time between August and October 1989, KM said that he assisted the appellant in removing rubbish.

49KM stated that he was struggling with his sexuality, believing he was gay, and wanted to talk to someone about it. He said he regarded the appellant as a surrogate father figure and told him that he thought he was gay. 

50KM said that one day in August or September 1989 the appellant offered to take him on a tour of the theatre. This included the behind stage area where some pantomime costumes were kept. KM said that the appellant pointed to one and said that he should try it on. KM said the appellant assisted him to get undressed, helping him take off his pants and underpants. When he was naked he said the appellant told him how good looking he was and touched him on the buttocks and around the crotch.

51Thereafter KM said that the appellant touched him on his penis and played with it until it became erect. This incident was the subject of Count 13.

52KM said that on another occasion in late 1989, he and the appellant drove in a small truck to the Menai Tip to remove rubbish. He said that during the drive the appellant reached over and started touching him on his leg. The appellant then moved his hand to KM's crotch area on the outside of his pants, and then to his crotch inside his pants but over his underpants.

53KM said that the appellant then moved his hand inside KM's underpants and touched his penis. KM said he got an erection which the appellant maintained by continually touching and squeezing his penis. This incident was the subject of Count 14.

54KM said that once they unloaded the rubbish they got back in the truck and drove toward the appellant's house. KM said that when he and the appellant arrived at the appellant's home, the appellant gave him a pair of Speedos. When KM got undressed the appellant started to touch him on his penis and he got an erection. This was the subject of Count 15.

55After KM put on the Speedos he said that he and the appellant commenced swimming in the pool at the appellant's house. The appellant took off his Speedos and encouraged KM to do the same and helped him to take them off. After he did, KM said the appellant touched him on his penis. He said he got an erection and the appellant maintained it by touching him. The appellant encouraged KM to touch his penis as well, moving his hand and leading it down to the appellant's crotch and telling him to touch or squeeze him. This was the subject of Count 16.

56KM said he then went to the edge of the pool and put his arms over the ledge. He said the appellant came up to him, lifted him away from the edge and used one of his hands to rub his buttocks. KM said he felt the appellant's finger move inside his anus and start to probe inside. This hurt and the appellant stopped. This incident was the subject of Count 17.

57KM said the appellant then kissed him on the mouth for a little while and KM then got out of the pool and sat on the edge with his feet dangling in the water. The appellant then swam up to him and opened his legs.

58KM said that the appellant then put his mouth around KM's penis and took it off, repeating this a couple of times. The appellant then started to move his head back and forth along KM's penis until KM thought he was about to ejaculate. KM did not want to do so, so he backed off. This was the subject of Count 18.

59After this occurred KM said that he and the appellant lay on the pavement next to the pool. The appellant continued to touch KM on his penis until he ejaculated. This was the subject of Count 19.

60In early 1990 KM and the appellant met at the theatre and from there went to the appellant's house. KM said that as they drove to the house the appellant touched him on the leg and then on his crotch on the outside of his pants. He then put his hand inside KM's pants and fondled KM's penis. 

61During the drive to the appellant's home KM said that the appellant told him that he had some homosexual pornography. KM said that when they arrived he and the appellant got undressed, lay on the bed, and watched the video. KM said the appellant started to fondle his penis and he got an erection. The appellant either asked KM to touch his penis or moved his hand so he was touching it. This was the subject of Count 20.

62KM said that the appellant then put his open mouth onto his penis and moved his head up and down. This was the subject of Count 21.

63KM said that the appellant encouraged him to do the same thing to him. KM said the appellant touched him on the head and encouraged him to move his head down to the appellant's crotch. KM said that he opened his mouth and put it on the appellant's penis. The appellant told him not to bite but to suck and to move his mouth up and down. KM said that he did this for a few minutes. This was the subject of Count 22.

64KM said the appellant then told him to lie on his stomach. The appellant fondled his penis between his legs and rubbed his hands up around KM's buttocks. KM said the appellant then inserted a finger into his anus. He pulled it out and inserted it again, KM believed more deeply. KM said he told the appellant it was hurting and he stopped. This incident was the subject of Count 23.

65Sometime between late January and March 1990 KM said he was again helping at the theatre. KM said that he and the appellant drove to the appellant's house and on the way the appellant put his hand down KM's pants and fondled him. This incident was the subject of Count 24.

66When they arrived at the house KM said he and the appellant went for a swim. After being in the pool for a period they took off their swimmers and swam naked. KM said the appellant touched and fondled his penis, causing it to become erect. KM also touched the appellant's erect penis. This incident was the subject of Count 25.

67In around April 1990 KM said that the appellant took him on another tour of the theatre. He and the appellant then drove to the appellant's house. KM said that during the drive the appellant touched him on the crotch and then put his hand on the front of his pants and fondled his penis until it became erect. This incident was the subject of Count 26.

68When they arrived at the appellant's house KM said that the appellant showed him some photographs of young males about his age, some in swimmers and some naked. KM said to the appellant how good they looked without any body hair. The appellant then offered to shave KM. KM said that he and the appellant then went to the sauna at the house. After they turned the sauna on they went to the bedroom, got undressed and watched a pornographic video. KM said the appellant began to fondle him and he reciprocated. This incident was the subject of Count 27.

69KM said that the appellant then encouraged him to put his mouth around the appellant's penis which he did. He said the appellant placed his hands on either side of KM's head and moved slowly back and forth. This went on for about five to ten minutes. This incident was the subject of Count 28.

70KM said that when that finished the appellant placed his mouth over KM's penis and did the same to him. This was the subject of Count 29.

71KM said that thereafter he and the appellant went to the sauna where the appellant fondled him until he became erect. This incident was the subject of Count 30.

72KM said that they then went for a swim after which they went to the bathroom where the appellant shaved KM's legs, stomach and chest areas. KM said the appellant then shaved his pubic area and whilst doing so fondled him to get an erection. This was the subject of Count 31.

73Thereafter KM said that he had a shower and returned to the lounge where there was swimwear laid out with a camera. Over the course of the next hour or hour and a half, KM said the appellant took photographs of him, some with him wearing a swimming costume and some naked. In some of the photographs KM had an erection because the appellant had fondled his penis. This incident was the subject of Count 32.

74In about late 1990 KM said he had a conversation with the appellant at the theatre. The appellant told him the photographs had turned out well and invited KM to his home to look at them. On the drive to the appellant's home KM said the appellant placed his hand straight down the front of KM's pants and fondled him to get an erection. This incident was the subject of Count 33.

75On the drive back following the viewing of the photographs KM said the appellant fondled him on his penis. This was the subject of Count 34.

76MH was around 14 years of age when he sought a job at the theatre. He received a phone call from the appellant to come in to meet him and to possibly try on an usher's uniform. Whilst he was trying on the uniform the appellant placed his hands on MH's hips and between his naval and pubic region to gauge the measurement.

77MH commenced working at the theatre in September or October 2002. MH said that during the Easter school holidays the following year he had a conversation with another employee at the theatre, during the course of which MH said that he had shaved his genital region after watching a pornographic film.

78The appellant found out about this and MH said the appellant asked him to pose for photographs. MH said he told the appellant he thought it was ""a bit gay"" but the appellant said there was nothing gay about it. MH then agreed.

79A couple of days after MH told the appellant that he had shaved his pubic hair, he and the appellant were in the staff room behind the candy bar. MH said the appellant closed the doors and said, ""Look come over this way and turn your back to the CCTV because there's a blind spot"". MH said that the appellant then asked to ""have a look at it"" (where he had shaved himself) and the appellant put his hands ""near my testicles and I guess went for a grope"". This incident was the subject of Count 35.

80When MH commenced working at the theatre he was picked up by his mother. However, subsequently he was taken home by the appellant. These car trips usually included MH, the appellant and another employee, MB, however occasionally it would only be MH and the appellant. 

81On one of these occasions MH said that the appellant asked to look at his genitalia to see how the hair growth was progressing. MH said it was not really a look, ""it was more of a fondle, he'd just go down for a fondle"". This incident was the subject of Count 36. 

82MH said he noticed a pattern evolving and after that he sought to ensure that MB was present when the appellant drove him home.

83MH said that on one occasion he encountered the appellant in the main foyer toilet. He said the appellant pushed him back into a cubicle and put his hands down his pants. MH described it in the following terms, ""I guess felt my penis, went for a grab"". This incident was the subject of Count 37.

84MH said that sometimes it was necessary for him to go to the candy bar supply room. He said he was mindful of the area being isolated and tried to be quick when down there. MH said that once the appellant caught him there and ""put his hand down my pants inside my underpants"" and would ""once again go for a grope"". This incident was the subject of Count 38.

The defence case

85The appellant gave evidence denying all of the allegations. Part of his evidence was supported by the evidence of Mr Tenant and MB. In addition, the appellant relied on evidence of good character, calling a number of character witnesses.

The conviction appeal

Ground 1 - The trial judge misdirected the jury as to the proper uses of evidence admitted as tendency evidence and failed to adequately direct the jury as to permissible and impermissible uses of the evidence

86The Crown sought to rely on tendency evidence at the trial, serving notices on 24 August 2011 prior to the first trial and on 19 March 2012 prior to the trial the subject of this appeal, which stated that the Crown intended to adduce tendency evidence pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The notice dated 19 March 2012 so far as relevant was in the following terms:

""The tendency sought to be proved is his/her tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, namely:

1. To have a sexual interest in young male employees
2. To engage in sexual activities with young male employees
3. To use his position of authority to obtain access to young male employees so that he could engage in sexual activity with them.

The activities which the Accused engaged in which demonstrate the tendencies described above include the proclivity of the Accused:

(a) to be alone with young male employees in a cinema
(b) to have young male employees alone with him in his car
(c) to have young male employees alone with him at his house
(d) to share his bed with young male employees
(e) to engage young male employees to undertake additional work beyond their employment at the cinema
(f) to be present while young male employees try on their uniform
(g) to hug young male employees
(h) to kiss young male employees
(i) to ask young male employees to show him their private parts being genitals or buttocks
(j) to touch young male employees on their genitals
(k) to touch young male employees on the genitals when they were alone with him in his cinema
(l) to masturbate young male employees
(m) to masturbate in the presence of young male employees when they were alone with him

(aa) to give young male employees free admission to films
(bb) to give young male employees free admission for friends and family to films
(cc) to give gifts to young male employees""

87The notice stated that the evidence of tendency sought to be adduced by the prosecution bore upon the facts in issue. The notice then set out in detail 52 particular facts that the tendency evidence was said to bear upon.

88On 5 September 2011, senior counsel for the appellant at the first trial filed a motion seeking orders including that the counts on the indictment relating to each of the complainants be severed from those relating to the other complainants and that the tendency evidence be excluded.

89On 8 September 2011 Judge North dismissed the motion. The appellant submitted that as the ruling of Judge North was not revisited at the trial the subject of this appeal, his judgment on the admissibility of tendency evidence was binding as a consequence of s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Whether this was so in circumstances where a further tendency notice was filed may be questionable but, in any event, no appeal has been brought in relation to the admission of the tendency evidence as distinct from the directions given in respect of it.

90The tendency evidence was referred to at length by both the trial judge and Crown Prosecutor at the trial. In her closing, the Crown Prosecutor considered the tendency evidence toward the beginning of her address:

""The other thing that has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, if you're going to rely on it, is the tendency. That is the tendency the Crown alleges the accused had to act in certain ways; his sexual interest with young male employees; the fact that he acted on that sexual interest. So that is another aspect; if you're going to rely on the tendency, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.""(26/06/2012 p 3)

91Later in her closing address, the Crown Prosecutor made the following observations in relation to the tendency evidence:

""Ladies and gentlemen, it is part of this Crown case to say that the accused had tendency to act in certain ways. Relying on the tendency in that way, you can use evidence from one victim in relation to another victim if you find beyond reasonable doubt that the tendency is established on one person's evidence or on two people's evidence. If you find it's established beyond reasonable doubt then it can interact between all these charges.

The tendencies that are alleged, it's a pattern of behaviour from the accused that he had a sexual interest in young male employees, that he engaged in sexual activities with young male employees, and he used his position of authority to obtain access to young male employees so he could engage in sexual activity with them.

I've addressed you a lot as I've gone through the evidence in relation to the patterns and bits of evidence that you can see that proves the tendency; being alone in the car, the cinema, the home, engaging them to get additional work beyond their employment in the cinema. Why? Because that way you're alone with the boy. That creates the situation, the closeness, the opportunities.

To be present when they try on their uniform. I forgot to refer to it yesterday in relation to [MH] but he spoke about how the accused slipped his hand down the front of his pants when he got him to strip off in front of him to try on his uniform. Remember what he did to [KM]. He doesn't do it with his mother. He's thirteen years old, his mother is there, he can get his uniform fitted. No. He waits until he's alone with the boy and he touches him.

Sharing his bed with young male employees; [PM], [DL], [KM]. [KM] doesn't stay overnight but he's certainly in bed with him.

The hugs, the kiss; Mark Lawrence. 

Asking young male employees to show him their private parts, being genitals or buttocks. He does it to Mark Lawrence. He does it to [MH]. He arranges it with [KM] in relation to wanting to photograph him. Touching them on their genitals, getting the accused to be masturbated by the boys, masturbating the boys, acts of fellatio when he's alone, requesting them to do that for him. The request was made of [DL] but he couldn't go through with it. [KM] did.

Discussion of pornographic material with the young male employees. We've got the use of pornography with Mark Lawrence, with [DL], with [KM] and the text, the way it happens in relation to [MH] is again about the pornography.

Offering to take photographs of young male employees, taking their photographs. That applies to three of them.

Being in their company in relation to Speedos, alcohol, an interest in the shaved genital area. [KM] he gets to shave down. [MH] he keeps on asking him about it.

Gift giving, providing of meals, getting their family to come in. This is special attention for these boys."" (27/06/2012 pp 4-5)

92As set out in the paragraph above, the Crown Prosecutor noted that in going through the evidence she had addressed the jury in relation to the ""patterns and bits of evidence"" that were said to prove the tendency. Examples from earlier in her closing included:

""There was one time when Mark Lawrence went to the accused's place that the accused played a pornographic video for him. That is sexualising the relationship between the employer and the employee. That is behaviour that will get repeated time and time again by the accused.

Of course, the accused has denied playing pornography for Mark Lawrence, the same as he denied playing it for [DL], the same as he denied playing it for [KM]. The same as he denied discussions about pornography with [MH].""(26/06/2012 p 5)

...

""But you can see that there's this pattern emerging of special attention for Mark Lawrence and the way he's treated by Philip Doyle. The pattern will be repeated many years later and many, many times.""(26/06/2012 p 6)

...

""Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is time, extra time the accused is manoeuvring to be able to spend with these boys, just like he did with Mark Lawrence, just like he did with [PM], taking him off for the driving lessons, and now he's starting with [DL]. In relation to taking stuff to the tip, again it's a pattern that he used with [KM]. Robert Tenant confirmed that throughout the time with the cinema because of the nature of the cinema there was always stuff going to the tip. So we've reached this pattern, we've reached this developing where he's got the more time spent with him, we've got the sexual jokes, we've got the extra time.""(26/06/2012 p 23)

...

""Ladies and gentlemen, you can see a very significant and substantial escalation in the behaviour. [KM] is treated differently from the other boys. But as I say, unlike the others, who were feeling dirty or disgusted or guilty, or that it was something wrong, [KM] was actually comfortable with the behaviour. And that is why, in my submission, the accused was able to keep going with what he did.

You can also see with this evidence that we've got the technique that's appeared before of a slow build up. You go to a stage where the person is comfortable before you go to the next step.

Normalised sexual behaviour, use of pornography, jokes, conversation about sexual activity, create excitement and anticipation by talking about pornography before showing it to a teenage boy. It's a pattern of behaviour that you see not just with [KM], but with the others, the progression, the build up, the acceleration, the escalation of the offending.""(26/06/2012 p 52)

93The trial judge's written directions to the jury so far as they related to the tendency evidence were in the following terms:

""Generally, juries may only consider in relation to a particular charge the evidence directly related to that charge and only such evidence. You have before you here the evidence that the Crown relies upon as establishing that the accused committed the particular offences set out in the indictment.

However in certain cases the Crown may be allowed to add to the evidence it calls to prove guilt of a particular charge what the law calls 'tendency' evidence.

Here, the Crown is allowed to assert, in the proof of any (or all) of the charges, a pattern of behaviour revealing that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way. Here, the Crown asserts that at the time of the alleged offences, the accused:

1. had a tendency to have a sexual interest in young male employees;

2. had a tendency to engage in sexual activities with young male employees; and

3. had a tendency to use his position of authority to obtain access to young male employees so that he could engage in sexual activity with them.

The Crown asserts that the tendencies of the accused which it alleges are demonstrated by the accused doing acts (drawn from the evidence related to all the charges) such as:

taking young males driving alone in his car; having young male employees to his house, alone; touching young male employees on the genitals while fitting their uniforms; questioning young male employees about their sexual experience; giving gifts to young male employees; discussing pornographic films with, and showing such films to young male employees; offering to take photographs of young male employees in underpants or naked; giving alcohol to young male employees; discussing the shaving of the genitals of younger male employees, and actually doing it.

The evidence of the accused having one or more of the tendencies alleged can only be used by you, in the way that the Crown asks you to use it, if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt.

The first finding is that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those alleged acts, which I have listed, in fact occurred.

In making any such finding you do not consider each of the acts in isolation but consider all the evidence and ask yourself whether you are satisfied that a particular act relied upon actually took place. If you cannot find that any of these acts is proved beyond reasonable doubt, then you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency advanced by the Crown.

If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those acts occurred, then you go on to consider the second finding. You ask yourself whether, from the act or acts that you have found proved, you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency that the Crown alleges. If you cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt, then again you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency alleged.

However, if having found one or more of the acts attributed to the accused to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and you can from the proved act or acts conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency to act in the particular way that the Crown alleges, you may use the fact of that tendency in considering whether the accused committed the offences charged, or any of them.

The evidence must not be used in any other way. It would be completely wrong to reason that, because the accused may have committed one crime or been guilty of one piece of misconduct, he is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed all or any of the other offences. That is not the purpose of the evidence at all and it must not be used in that way.""
(Emphasis in original)

94The written directions also contained the following in relation to the issue of separate consideration of the counts in the indictment:

""Subject to a later direction about 'tendency' evidence, you must consider and decide upon each count separately, on the basis of the evidence relating to that charge.

Giving separate consideration to the individual counts means that you are entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on some other counts if there is a logical reason for that outcome.

If you were to find the accused not guilty on any count, particularly if that was because you had doubts about the reliability of the complainant's evidence, you would have to consider whether or how that conclusion affected your consideration of the remaining counts.""

This written direction was delivered in almost identical terms in the trial judge's summing up to the jury (29/06/2012 p 2). 

95In summing up the trial judge addressed at an early stage the function of complaint and tendency evidence in the following terms:

""In considering the various complainants' evidence and whether it does satisfy you of the accused's guilt on one or more of the relevant charges, you can look to see if that evidence is supported by other evidence in the trial. Such other evidence includes complaint evidence and tendency evidence and in this case the Crown says that there is evidence of this kind to support the evidence of the individual complainants ..."" (29/06/2012 pp 5-6)

96The trial judge then gave lengthy directions concerning the use that the jury could make of the tendency evidence. This was largely consistent with his Honour's written directions and was in the following terms:

""TENDENCY EVIDENCE

Generally juries may only consider in relation to a particular charge the evidence directly related to that charge and only such evidence. You have before you here the evidence that the Crown relies upon as establishing that the accused committed the particular offences set out in the indictment. However, in certain cases, the Crown maybe allowed to add to the evidence it calls to prove guilt of a particular charge, what the law calls tendency evidence.

Here the Crown is allowed to assert in the proof of any or all of the charges a pattern of behaviour revealing that the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way. Here the Crown asserts that at the time of the alleged offences the accused (1) had a tendency to have a sexual interest in young male employees, (2) had a tendency to engage in sexual activities with young male employees and, (3) had a tendency to use his position of authority to obtain access to young male employees so that he could engage in sexual activity with them.

The Crown asserts that the tendencies of the accused which it alleges are demonstrated by the accused doing acts drawn from the evidence related to all the charges such as taking young males driving alone in his car, having young male employees to his house alone, touching young male employees on the genitals while fitting their uniforms, questioning young male employees about their sexual experience, giving gifts to young male employees, discussing pornographic films with and showing such films to young male employees, offering to take photographs of young male employees in underpants or naked, giving alcohol to young male employees, discussing the shaving of the genitals of younger male employees and actually doing it.

The evidence of the accused having one or more of the tendencies alleged can only be used by you in the way the Crown asks you to use it if you make two findings beyond reasonable doubt. The first finding is that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those alleged acts which I have listed in fact occurred. In making any such finding you do not consider each of the acts in isolation but consider all of the evidence and ask yourself whether you are satisfied that a particular relied upon actually took place. If you cannot find that any of these acts is proved beyond reasonable doubt then you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency advanced by the Crown.

If you do find beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of those acts occurred then you go onto consider the second finding. You ask yourself whether from the act or acts that you found proved you can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency that the Crown alleges. If you cannot draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt then again you must put aside any suggestion that the accused had the tendency alleged. However, if having found one or more of the acts attributed to the accused to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and you can from the proved act or acts conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the tendency to act in the particular way that the Crown alleges, you may use the fact of that tendency in considering whether the accused committed the offences charged or any of them. The evidence must not be used in any other way. It would be completely wrong to reason that because the accused may have committed one crime or been guilty of one piece of misconduct is therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason must have committed all or any of the other offences. That is not the purpose of the evidence at all and it must not be used in that way.

EVIDENCE ABOUT SEXUAL CONDUCT NOT CHARGED IN THE INDICTMENT

At various points in their evidence several complainants referred to episodes of sexual contact other than the specific charges enumerated in the indictment. For example, [KM] said that 'It happened on numerous occasions a lot more than what is indicated in my statement'; transcript 656.

This evidence is properly before you as tendency evidence, but where there is an allegation of sexually improper conduct other than that specified in the indictment, you should approach the evidence as follows:

(1) You must disregard that evidence entirely unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged sexually improper conduct in fact occurred.

(2) Even if you accept that such sexually improper conduct in fact occurred you must not substitute proof of such conduct not charged in the indictment for proof of one of the acts specifically charged in the indictment. However, provided you act on these directions you are entitled to consider such evidence in proof of one or more of the charges if it persuades you of an element of a charge."" (29/06/2012 pp 15-17)

97Later in summing up the trial judge made a number of references to the tendency evidence when summarising the Crown case. His Honour referred on a number of occasions to the consistency in evidence between the complainants, including in the following: 

""The Crown puts it that you would believe that his version [Mark Lawrence's] about touching and hugging and kissing in the car. It was sporadic and consistent with the other approaches he has made to boys.""(02/07/2012 p 17)

... 

""Now the Crown made submissions to you about these allegations and in relation to [PM] she urged upon you, as she did in relation to the other complainants, that the direct evidence has to be supplemented by the fact that there are five independent complainants; that you would regard the conduct overall as demonstrating the tendencies of sexual interest in young men which the Crown alleges.""(02/07/2012 p 33)

...

""The Crown put it to you that you would accept his evidence [PM's] about the Subaru, that there were driving lessons out to Kurnell, that the accused said there is no need for a swimming costume at some point, and that even though the accused ever denied going out to Kurnell, that you would not believe that. That there are three complainants all of whom have no contact with each other, all of whom describe being driven out to Kurnell. You would find that a stronger pointer to the sexual interest in having young boys such as [PM] alone in circumstances where he could be influential.""(02/07/2012 p 34)

...

""The Crown says to you that, as with the other complainants, you would consider the evidence of [DL] in light of what the Crown alleges is a pattern of similar kinds of misconduct by the accused flowing from his attraction to young men.""(02/07/2012 p 59)

...

""The Crown went through the various episodes with you involving gay videos, indecent assaults on the bed, oral sex, the swimwear, the shaving of him after being in the sauna and his interest in shaving is consistent with the [MH] matter. Again, the Crown says that the description of occasional quick episodes of fondling in quiet parts of the cinema described by [KM] are consistent with what Mark Lawrence describes.""(03/07/2012 p 25)

...

""The Crown says you would accept the version given by [MH] who was independent of everybody else, much younger, no suggestion that he had got together and told a story in collaboration with [PM] or [KM] or the others. But you get this line again, the Crown says, 'You're so good looking you could be a model.' And this is what [MH] says and the Crown says, well, that is part of the pattern, that is part of his game plan with young men, just like with [KM]. And even though the accused is 60 by this time, he is still, the Crown says, actively interested in young men sexually. And the Crown says you would accept the version given by [MH] of the continuing and repeated sexual interest shown by the accused in the way that he said.""(03/07/2012 p 36)

98Finally, the trial judge made a number of further remarks in relation to the tendency evidence toward the conclusion of his Honour's summing up:

""The Crown case emphasises, to some significant degree, the number of complainants in this case and says that the sheer number of the complainants who come forward independently to give the versions which they do is very supportive of the Crown proposition that the accused has a tendency to be interested in young men in the ways that have been suggested.

There is no way that [MH], [PM], Lawrence, [DL] and so on got together and put their heads together to invent stories and, on the Crown approach to the case, you might expect that there would be some confusions and weaknesses in stories told about events years ago. But when you look at the overall pattern, you would be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that all of these men, despite some minor confusions or irregularities in their evidence, are telling you the truth; that the character of Mr Doyle is not the character of the outstanding citizen he represents himself to be, rather it is the character of a man who has an interest in molesting young boys and youths over the years, running the sort of business he has; has had the opportunity to pick and choose amongst them; he has picked and chosen a number of attractive young men and he has, indeed, done the things which they say he did. 

...

Except with one charge, the charges are brought within a range of dates, therefore it is difficult for Mr Doyle to defend himself against allegations which are uncertain about when they occurred and that perspective is one that you should bear in mind. On the one hand, you have got the Crown suggesting a pattern of interest in young men. On the other hand, you have got positive evidence of good character. So, you have to give consideration to those matters."" (03/07/2012 pp 38-39)

The appellant's submissions

99The appellant submitted that according to the tendency notices the prosecution did not seek to admit the evidence as coincidence evidence pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act. As such, he submitted that evidence of two or more events occurring was not admissible to prove a particular act or state of mind on the basis that it was improbable that the events were a coincidence. 

100Although the appellant accepted that the evidence relied upon by the Crown Prosecutor was admissible, he submitted that it was relied upon in such a way as to invoke coincidence reasoning.

101The appellant submitted that the written and oral directions given by the trial judge in relation to the tendency evidence were erroneous in a number of respects. He submitted that it was left open to the jury to reason that he had one of the three listed tendencies if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any of the activities set out in subpars (a) to (cc) of the tendency notice. He submitted that the activities were not capable of proving any tendency unless coupled with a sexual act. For instance, he submitted that having ""young male employees alone with him in his car"", which was not disputed by the appellant, was not capable of proving any of the tendencies without a sexual act also having occurred in the car.

102The appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to engage in ""circular reasoning"" in relation to the tendency evidence. This was said to have occurred as a result of the jury being directed to consider the evidence related to all of the charges when considering if the appellant had any of the three tendencies. The appellant submitted that it was impermissible to use the alleged occurrence of two events in order to prove that both events had occurred. 

103The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred by permitting the jury to engage in coincidence reasoning and by repeating and failing to correct instances in which the Crown Prosecutor relied on coincidence reasoning in her summing up. In that context he made particular reference to the portion of the summing up to which I have referred in par [98] above. The appellant submitted that coincidence reasoning was evident in the trial judge's reference to ""the sheer number of the complainants"" and also the repeated mention of the consistency in evidence as between the complainants, examples of which are set out at par [97]. It was submitted that the trial judge in doing so failed to correct coincidence reasoning. 

104The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that they could not reason in the manner suggested by the Crown Prosecutor in her closing address. The appellant submitted that the Crown Prosecutor used impermissible coincidence reasoning in summarising the evidence of the complainants to identify a pattern. Examples said to demonstrate coincidence reasoning by the Crown Prosecutor are set out in par [92]. 

105The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred by refusing to give a direction sought by senior counsel that the defence had no way of knowing whether the complainants had or had not spoken to one another. It was also submitted that the jury were not reminded that several of the complainants came forward following media attention regarding charges having been brought against the appellant. In fact such a reminder had been given in respect of KM and MH (see the directions under the heading ""Complaint Evidence Generally"" set out in par [187] below).

106The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that if they accepted the evidence of good character regarding the appellant, then they might have a reasonable doubt in relation to the tendency evidence. The appellant submitted that the trial judge obscured the proper use of tendency evidence and the onus of proof when he, as set out in par [98] above, referred to a ""pattern of interest in young men"" alongside ""positive evidence of good character"".

107Finally, the appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to give a direction in accordance with R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 (Markuleski).

108Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that a number of the listed activities in the tendency notice such as (a), (b), (s), (t), (x) and (z) were ordinary incidents of employment. He submitted that the first listed tendency was irrelevant except as a route to the second tendency. He also submitted that the third alleged tendency was relevant only as an aspect feeding into the second tendency. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that for a tendency to be probative it needed to be a sexual interest upon which the person acts. 

109Senior counsel for the appellant addressed the distinction between tendency and coincidence evidence. He submitted in relation to tendency evidence that what has to be established separately is the tendency itself. As such, tendency evidence works temporally and incrementally in order to establish the alleged tendency. Conversely, he submitted that coincidence evidence invokes a different process of reasoning that involves identifying events that are often not disputed, from which a conclusion can be drawn that the alleged event is not a coincidence. He submitted that as soon as reference is made to aspects like the ""sheer number of the complainants"" then one is reasoning to coincidence rather than tendency. 

110Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the events the subject of a specific count could not be used to satisfy oneself of a tendency regarding that count. He submitted that it made no sense to require that uncharged acts be proved independently beyond reasonable doubt, but not in respect of charged acts. He submitted that relying on the very thing that is sought to be proven throws away the exercise by introducing to the jury what amounts to legal nonsense. He submitted that if one was satisfied in relation to Count 1 then that could be used to establish a tendency in relation to Count 2. However, he asserted the trial judge erred by inviting the jury to have regard to the ""evidence related to all the charges"" when considering if the tendencies were made out. This, he said, pulled in everything including the charges which were to be proven. 

111Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred by invoking a process of coincidence reasoning. He pointed to the trial judge's reference in summing up to the ""sheer number of the complainants"" as ""supportive of the proposition that the accused has a tendency to be interested in young men"". He submitted such statements by the trial judge and Crown Prosecutor did not reason incrementally to a tendency; instead, it was reasoning that it cannot be a coincidence that there were numerous people making allegations. He submitted that even if it was a case of coincidence evidence, warnings would be given against reasoning based on the sheer number of complainants. 

112Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge's direction regarding sexual conduct not charged on the indictment, as set out in par [96] above, was instructive. He questioned that if the facts in issue that were the subject of the counts were permitted to be taken into account in considering tendency, why would a special direction be given in relation to the uncharged acts but not in relation to the charged acts? He accepted that the nub of the issue was that a direction should have been given as to the manner in which the charged acts could be used to establish tendency similar to the direction given in relation to the uncharged acts. 

113Senior counsel for the appellant reiterated that the trial judge erred by repeating submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor in relation to the number of complainants. He referred to the trial judge's statement, set out in par [97] above, that the ""direct evidence has to be supplemented by the fact that there are five independent complainants"" as an example of reasoning by the number of complainants and not by tendency.

114In relation to a Markuleski direction, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that where the jury had been wrongly directed as to tendency, it is not appropriate to have regard to the jury's verdicts in coming to a conclusion about whether or not such a direction should have been given. 

115As to the issue of leave, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that while Ground 1 picked up factual issues, questions of law were imbedded in the ground. He submitted that an application to exclude the tendency evidence was made before Judge North. However, he accepted that the application was not renewed before the trial judge. 

The Crown submissions

116The Crown at the outset of its submissions noted that none of the matters relied upon in support of this ground of appeal were raised before the trial judge.

117The Crown rejected the proposition that the activities alleged in the tendency notice were not capable of proving one of the tendencies unless coupled with a sexual act. The Crown referred to the alleged tendency to ""have a sexual interest in young male employees"" which was said to not require a sexual act. The Crown further submitted that the trial judge's written directions, set out at par [93] above, made it apparent that the jury could not move from finding one of the activities proved to one of the tendencies proved without being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the proved acts established the tendency.

118The Crown submitted that the trial judge's directions regarding tendency evidence did not lead to circular reasoning. The Crown submitted that unlike R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174; (2012) 217 A Crim R 487, upon which the appellant relied, the present case did not involve an assumption as to the facts that were to be proved. The Crown relied on a statement in R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210; (2002) 130 A Crim R 89 that the force of coincidence evidence arises from the co-existence of multiple pieces of evidence, where there might not be satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt from a single piece of evidence considered alone. It was submitted that similar reasoning applies to tendency evidence. 

119The Crown submitted that none of the comments made by the trial judge in his summing up in relation to the Crown's argument involved coincidence reasoning. The Crown also submitted that none of the material referred to by the appellant either formed part of his Honour's directions or involved coincidence reasoning, and if it had, it did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. In this regard, the Crown relied particularly on the judgment of Simpson J in KJR v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 165; (2007) 173 A Crim R 226. The Crown emphasised that the trial judge clearly directed the jury as to how they could use tendency reasoning as set out at par [93] above.

120In relation to a direction regarding possible communication between the complainants, the Crown submitted that the trial judge gave reasons for refusing to give such a direction, essentially that the issue had not been explored in evidence. The Crown also submitted that the trial judge was not asked to remind the jury of complainants coming forward after publicity regarding charges having been brought against the appellant and that the absence of such a reminder could not have caused the trial to miscarry.

121The Crown submitted in relation to the trial judge's direction regarding good character and tendency evidence that the passage referred to by the appellant, set out at par [98] above, should be considered in its full context. The Crown emphasised that following the trial judge's summing up the Crown Prosecutor suggested his Honour deal with each of the appellant's character witnesses. The Crown submitted that senior counsel for the appellant at the trial accepted the trial judge's invitation to respond regarding character witnesses by asking for the evidence of Mr McWhinney to be referred to and seeking certain directions as to the use to be made of the evidence of Ms Scott and Ms Johnston (see Ground 9 below). The Crown submitted no other objection was taken to the direction.

122In relation to the appellant's submission that the trial judge failed to give a Markuleski direction, the Crown submitted that the written directions set out at par [94] above were appropriate to raise the issues referred to in that case. The Crown submitted that even if the direction was not appropriate, there could not have been a miscarriage of justice in the present case where guilty verdicts were returned on all counts. 

123At the hearing, counsel for the Crown reiterated that the trial judge gave a direction of the type in Markuleski, and further, in a case where there were no acquittals the issue did not assume anything like the same importance.

124Counsel for the Crown emphasised that the trial judge's summing up had to be read as a whole. She stated that the appellant's written submissions were replete with references to parts of the summing up but that it needed to be read in its entirety.

125Counsel for the Crown accepted that to prove a tendency in the nature of the second listed tendency it was necessary to prove a charged or an uncharged offence. She accepted that the activities referred to by the trial judge in his summing up, set out at par [96] above, would not have been enough to be relied on to support the tendency notice. She accepted that this matter should have been made clear to the jury. However, she submitted that as a matter of logic and the manner in which the jury were directed, this issue would have been clear to the jury. She submitted that a specific direction was not required. 

The legislative framework

126The admission of tendency and coincidence evidence is governed by ss 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act which relevantly provide as follows:

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.

Note. The tendency rule is subject to specific exceptions concerning character of and expert opinion about accused persons (sections 110 and 111). Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as further exceptions.

98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: 

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

Note. One of the events referred to in subsection (1) may be an event the occurrence of which is a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if: 

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.

Note. Other provisions of this Act, or of other laws, may operate as exceptions to the coincidence rule.

...

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.""

Consideration

127As I indicated, it was common ground between the appellant and the Crown that to establish the second tendency referred to in the tendency notice, namely, to engage in sexual activities with young male employees, it was necessary to prove a charged act or a sexual offence with such an employee. Perhaps more accurately in the context of this case, to prove the second tendency it would be at least necessary for the jury to, first, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant engaged in one of the activities referred to in subpars (j) to (o) of the tendency notice and, second, to also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the engagement in such activities proved that the appellant had the tendency alleged in par (2) of the tendency notice. The position, in my opinion, was the same so far as the third tendency in the notice was concerned, having regard to the fact that the notice states that the purpose of obtaining access to young male employees was to engage in sexual activity with them.

128However, that does not mean that the other activities described in the tendency notice or the first listed tendency were irrelevant. Whilst some of those activities, even if proved beyond reasonable doubt, may well have been insufficient to establish the second tendency, the jury if satisfied that a number of those events occurred could have concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had a sexual interest in young male employees. This conclusion would have been a relevant factor in their deliberations of whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one of the charges against the appellant was established.

129There is no doubt that to the extent reliance was placed on uncharged sexual conduct in establishing the tendency, that conduct had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt: HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [41], [46] and [196]; DJV v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 272; (2008) 200 A Crim R 206 at [19] and [30]. The trial judge explained this in his direction to the jury in the part of his summing up headed ""Evidence About Sexual Conduct Not Charged In The Indictment"", which I have set out in par [96] above.

130The appellant did not cavil with the directions given in relation to the uncharged acts, but submitted that the jury should have been specifically directed that the charged acts themselves could not be used to establish the tendency unless the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of such charged acts occurred, without having regard to the tendency evidence. He accepted, for example, that if the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of the charges relating to Mr Lawrence, they could use that as tendency evidence in considering the charges against at least PM and DL.

131The trial judge's direction in fact did not deal with the potential use of the charged acts as tendency evidence at all. In the direction to which I have referred in par [96], his Honour dealt with matters that did not constitute sexual offences (see the third paragraph of his direction under the heading ""Tendency Evidence"" set out in par [96] above). His direction as to how that evidence could be used seemed to relate only to establish tendency alleged from those particular acts. 

132The written directions were in the same form.

133At the outset of his written directions the trial judge explained that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element of a charge and that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each complainant was an honest witness and was reliable as to the vital parts of his evidence before finding the appellant guilty. They were also told that subject to his directions regarding tendency evidence, they were to consider the evidence in relation to each count separately. There was no suggestion that a conviction in respect of any of the counts could be used as tendency evidence in respect of the other counts.

134I have set out above the address of the Crown Prosecutor so far as it related to tendency evidence. The Crown submitted to the jury that those portions of the tendency notice which referred to activities involving sexual misconduct could be used as showing the tendencies in the notice, but stated that the tendency had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The trial judge also made it clear that to prove the tendency beyond reasonable doubt the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt both that the activities said to have given rise to the tendency occurred and that those activities gave rise to the tendency in question.

135In these circumstances the trial judge, in my opinion, did not fall into error in not directing the jury that if and only if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that one or more of the charged acts occurred without having regard to the evidence relating to the other charged acts, they could then use that conclusion as tendency evidence in respect of the other charges if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the tendency was established. In one sense a failure to give such a direction was favourable to the appellant, as the direction did not suggest that evidence relating to the charged acts could be used to establish the tendencies complained of.

136I do not think this position is affected by the fact that the trial judge directed that the jury should not look at the acts in isolation but consider all the evidence to determine if the acts took place. The acts in question were those summarised in the direction and the direction emphasised the need for satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that those acts in fact took place.

137As I indicated, the appellant submitted that the direction referred to in the preceding paragraph involved what he described as circular reasoning. It is correct that as a matter of logic a fact cannot be proved by a chain of reasoning which assumes the truth of that fact: Sutton v The Queen [1984] HCA 5; (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 532; Thompson v The Queen [1989] HCA 30; (1989) 169 CLR 1 at 17. That does not mean, however, that the evidence of a fact said to establish a tendency need be proved by considering its existence or otherwise divorced from other evidence at the trial. That was made clear in Thompson supra at 17 in the following passage from the judgment of Mason CJ and Dawson J when considering what is now described as coincidence evidence:

""The nine points of similarity advanced by the prosecution and apparently accepted by the trial judge went too far. In considering whether the deaths at Richardson displayed the necessary degree of similarity to the deaths of the two sisters, it was impermissible to include as a fact the matter which it was sought to prove, namely, that the deaths did not occur by accident. The points of similarity accepted by the trial judge assumed that the two sisters were shot through the head, as were the victims of the Richardson killings. That was tantamount to assuming the truth of the fact in issue which the similar fact evidence was tendered to prove. As Brennan J. pointed out in Sutton:

'It is a canon of logic, rather than of law, that one cannot prove a fact by a chain of reasoning which assumes the truth of that fact. That canon has a particular application in determining the cogency and hence the admissibility of similar fact evidence. When the Crown seeks to tender similar fact evidence as the foundation for inferring a fact to be proved in a trial, it is erroneous to assume the truth of the fact to be proved in determining the cogency of the evidence. ... That proposition does not preclude reference to direct evidence of the fact to be proved in determining the cogency of similar fact evidence. Similar fact evidence tending to confirm the existence or occurrence of such a fact may be confirmed by direct evidence of the same fact.'

We would only add to that passage the comment that there does not seem to be any reason why the evidence of the fact to be proved which confirms the similar fact evidence, or adds to its cogency, should be confined to direct evidence.

The similarity between the killings at Richardson and those of the two sisters was to be considered in the light of the whole of the evidence.""(Citation omitted)

138R v Gale; R v Duckworth supra, relied on by the appellant, is an example of where coincidence evidence sought to be relied upon assumed the truth of the actual fact required to be proved to establish the offence. The accused were charged with robbing a hotel at Nimbin. Duckworth was the licensee of the hotel and it was alleged that he and Gale were parties to the robbery, having fabricated a story that Duckworth was the victim.

139Gale and Duckworth had previously pleaded guilty to a robbery at a Queensland hotel which was carried out by them with the assistance of the manager of that hotel. The similarities alleged included the presence of Gale and Duckworth at both robberies and that an insider was involved in both (the manager at the Queensland hotel and Duckworth at Nimbin). The coincidence evidence thus assumed the very matters to be proved, namely, the presence of Gale and the involvement of Duckworth.

140By contrast, in the present case there was no such assumption. The facts that were said to give rise to the alleged tendencies had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt as the first step in proving that the appellant had any of the particular tendencies. It did not involve any assumption of fact.

141It can be noted that it is by no means exceptional for tendency to be proved by reliance on evidence established in relation to one of a number of charges in the indictment. In BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 303 evidence of different complainants as to the conduct of the appellant towards them was held to have been correctly admitted as evidence having significant probative value. Hodgson JA dealt with the matter in the following terms:

""[112] In my opinion, subject to the question of concoction, to which I will return, features of the appellant's conduct described by each complainant were sufficiently similar and sufficiently unusual for the evidence of each of them to have significant probative value in showing the specified tendencies; and the existence of those tendencies would have significant probative value in supporting other evidence that the appellant committed the offences charged. In my opinion, it is unusual for a parent or grandparent to do acts of the kind described by each witness, and the acts described by each, if accepted, would in my opinion to a very significant extent rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the appellant having an unusual sexual interest in his daughter and granddaughters and having a tendency to give effect to that interest in assaulting them; and the existence of those tendencies in turn would to a very significant extent rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the commission of the offences charged. In my opinion also, the probative value of the evidence is such that it substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have. The danger of the jury responding inappropriately to it, or giving it more weight than it truly deserves, is in my opinion small, particularly if appropriate directions are given.""

See also KRI v The Queen [2011] VSCA 127; (2011) 207 A Crim R 552.

142In the present case no objection was taken to the activities referred to in the tendency notice being relied upon as evidence establishing the asserted tendencies, nor was it suggested that the tendencies if established could be irrelevant in proving the charges. As the trial judge directed, it was necessary for those activities to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and for the jury to also be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the activities so proved gave rise to the alleged tendency. The direction in my opinion adequately dealt with those issues.

143Of more concern is the fact that the activities enumerated by the trial judge both in his written directions and in his Honour's summing up could only go to establish the first of the three tendencies referred to in the tendency notice. However, as the jury was directed that even if the activities were established they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those activities established one of the tendencies, I do not think that the direction in the terms it was given caused a miscarriage of justice.

144The appellant next complained that the trial judge not only failed to direct the jury not to engage in coincidence reasoning but also failed to correct the impermissible use of the evidence as coincidence evidence in the summing up by the prosecutor. That submission must be considered in the context of the written directions set out at par [93] above that subject to the question of tendency, the evidence on each count was required to be considered separately and that if the proved activities established the tendency beyond reasonable doubt, the jury could then use the fact of that tendency in considering whether the accused committed the offence, but the evidence could not be used in any other way. The trial judge also emphasised that it would be wrong to reason that because the accused may have committed one crime or be guilty of one piece of misconduct, he was therefore generally a person of bad character and for that reason may have committed all or any of the other offences: see also par [93] above.

145Particular complaint was made of that portion of the summing up which is extracted at par [98] above. In the first two paragraphs the trial judge was self-evidently summarising the Crown case. In the first paragraph the trial judge, whilst referring to the ""sheer number of the complainants"", did so in the context of the proposition that the appellant had the tendency to be interested in young men. Although the trial judge referred in the next paragraph to the ""overall pattern"", that is not necessarily an invitation to adopt coincidence reasoning, particularly in light of the warning that the trial judge had previously given as to the use which could be made of the evidence.

146I will not go into detail in relation to the other areas of the summing up about which complaints of this nature are made. However, it must be emphasised that the references to the Crown Prosecutor's address contained in the summing up about which complaints are made must be read in context. Thus, reference in the summing up to the Crown submission ""that the direct evidence has to be supplemented by the fact that there are five independent complainants"" is immediately followed by ""you would regard the conduct overall as demonstrating the tendencies of sexual interest in young men"". The same comment was made after the third of the statements referred to, ""That there are three complainants all of whom have no contact with each other, all of whom describe being driven out to Kurnell"". The other statements complained of are consistent with tendency reasoning, although they could also involve coincidence reasoning. However, the fact remains that the trial judge directed the jury as to the limited use that could be made of such evidence.

147The situation in the present case is analogous to that considered by this Court in KJR v The Queen supra. The appellant in that case was charged with various sexual offences. Evidence of various other offences not the subject of the charges was admitted to establish tendency. The trial judge in his summing up said of that evidence: ""You could use that finding to assist you to conclude that the accused must have committed the other offences in which a similar practice was adopted"". On appeal it was argued that the direction was erroneous as it invited coincidence reasoning. This ground of appeal was rejected. Simpson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed, made the following remarks:

""[3] The relevant directions have been set out in the judgment of Rothman J. I agree with his Honour that there are some passages in the summing up that are couched in language more commonly associated with s 98 (coincidence) evidence than s 97 (tendency) evidence. An example of this is to be found in the passage first extracted under the heading 'Ground 1' where there is a reference to 'a striking similarity between two or more events', giving rise to a conclusion that the offences in question were committed by the same person. Identifying the appellant as the person who committed one or more offences by reference to his having committed another, or others, and parallels in the manner of these being carried out, simply was not an issue in this case. But the language used was not inapt to the issues raised for a jury by tendency evidence. In Gardiner v The Queen (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 I considered the purpose of s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). At [124] I wrote:

'124 Underlying s 97 is an unstated but obvious premise. That is that proving that a person has a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind in some way bears upon the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. The fact in issue is the conduct, or state of mind, on a particular occasion relevant to the issues in the proceedings, of the person whose tendency is the subject of the evidence tendered. That is, evidence that a person has or had a tendency to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind is not tendered in a vacuum. It is tendered for the purpose of further proving (or contributing to proving) that, on a particular occasion, that person acted in that way or had that state of mind. Proof of the tendency is no more than a step on the way to proving (usually by inference) that the person acted in that way, or had that state of mind, on the relevant occasion.'

Proof of a tendency, whether of conduct or a state of mind, is a stepping stone on the way to proof of an ultimate issue. If it is proven that two or more allegations made by a complainant are of conduct having a 'striking similarity', that 'striking similarity' is also available to prove tendency to behave in a particular way. Proof that an accused person had a tendency to behave in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, is tendered for the purpose of proving that, on the particular occasion in question, that person behaved in the particular way alleged, or had the particular state of mind alleged.""

148In the present case the similarity of conduct was available to prove tendency and the trial judge said on more than one occasion that it could only be used for that purpose. In those circumstances the direction was not erroneous.

149It also follows, in my opinion, that it was unnecessary for the trial judge to emphasise that the matters raised by the Crown Prosecutor, to which I have referred in par [91]-[92], could only be used as evidence of tendency. The use that could be made of such evidence was adequately stated.

150As I indicated, the trial judge declined to give a direction that the defence had no way of knowing of whether the complainants had or had not spoken to each other. In circumstances where there was no evidence or suggestion that they had spoken, it was not erroneous for the trial judge to decline to give the direction sought.

151Further, the appellant did not seek a direction that some of the complainants only came forward subsequent to the publication of the charges. No miscarriage of justice has been shown from the failure to give such a direction and in those circumstances r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.

152The appellant also criticised the trial judge's direction as to good character. The criticism had two limbs. The first was the failure to refer to the whole of the body of character evidence brought forward by the appellant. In this context it must be remembered that early in his summing up the trial judge referred to what he described as uncontested evidence of good character, stating that the jury should take it into account on the question of guilt and in relation to whether the appellant's evidence should be believed (29/06/2012 pp 20-21). On the third day of the summing up he referred to the Crown proposition that the evidence demonstrated that the appellant was not the person of outstanding character claimed, but rather had the character of a man who had an interest in molesting young boys. He then referred immediately thereafter to the submission put by senior counsel for the appellant at trial that there was good character evidence completely inconsistent with the Crown version, referring in general terms to evidence of persons whose children had gone ""through his business"" and who denied ever suffering or observing any molestation or irregularity of a sexual kind (03/07/2012 pp 38-39). At the conclusion of the summing up the Crown Prosecutor indicated that the trial judge had not specifically gone to the character evidence. On being asked whether he sought any further direction, senior counsel for the appellant stated that the trial judge had covered the material adequately in summary, but asked that reference be made to the evidence of a Mr McWhinney, and further, in relation to the evidence of Ms Smith and Ms Johnston, that the jury be told it was not appropriate to reason from the fact that they had asked their children if they had been molested, that they were concerned about the appellant. The trial judge complied with that request (03/07/2012 pp 41-42, 46-48).

153I do not think in those circumstances that the directions were inadequate. Although the trial judge did not refer in detail to all the character witnesses, he did summarise the effect of the evidence and complied with senior counsel's request for elaboration. The jury could have been in no doubt that the accused presented himself as a man of exemplary character and it was necessary to take that into account in determining whether any of the allegations brought against him were made out. Nor do I think the trial judge erred in failing to tell the jury that if they accepted the evidence of good character they might have reasonable doubt in relation to the alleged tendencies. It seems to me that what was said by the trial judge in that portion of the summing up referred to in par [152] above sufficiently averted to this issue. The trial judge also indicated in the portion of the summing up set out in par [98] above, that the evidence of good character had to be taken into account in evaluating the Crown's suggestion that the appellant had a particular interest in young men. Once again senior counsel for the appellant at the trial made no complaint about the direction. Even if a further direction should have been given, r 4 applies and it has not been shown that any miscarriage of justice arose.

154The final matter raised under this ground was that the trial judge failed to give a direction in accordance with R v Markuleski supra. The direction referred to is that in the case of multiple counts reference should be made to the effect upon the assessment of the complainant's credibility in a word against word case if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence on any count. In Markuleski at [186]-[188], Spigelman CJ stated it is not necessary to specify any precise words, but it will often be enough to direct the jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant's evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or the reliability of the complainant's evidence generally.

155I have set out at par [94] above the direction given to the jury as to the course they should adopt if they found the appellant not guilty on any count because of doubts as to the reliability of the complainant's evidence. Interestingly, the trial judge's direction was in the form suggested in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book. Notwithstanding this it may have been preferable to precisely indicate that doubt as to the reliability of the complainant on one count should be taken into account in the jury's assessment of their reliability on other counts. However, the direction in my opinion was adequate to alert the jury as to the impact of doubts as to a complainant's credibility on one count on their assessment of other counts.

156Finally, the point was not taken by senior counsel for the appellant at the trial and as there was a verdict of guilty returned on all counts there was no miscarriage of justice. Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.

157It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 2 - The learned trial judge erred in admitting evidence of complaint related to DL in the trial 

158During the first trial, DL was cross-examined in relation to whether he had complained to his father about any of the incidents he said took place between him and the appellant. He gave evidence that at the time of the incidents he did not tell his father, but said that he told his father about the storm incident some 10 years prior to the first trial.

159The prosecutor made an application pursuant to s 108 of the Evidence Act to re-establish DL's credibility in respect of this complaint and to lead evidence of a further complaint made to KB, the ex-wife of KL. Judge North rejected the evidence as DL had not been cross-examined on such a complaint. Judge North also rejected an application to call KL. 

160However, before the trial judge an application was made to revisit the ruling and to lead evidence from both DL and KL as to this complaint. The basis was that at the time the order was made by Judge North the Crown was not on notice that alibi evidence would be given.

161Although the trial judge was not referred in detail to the evidence given by the appellant at the first trial, his evidence was that on the night of the storm which occurred on the day of the incident the subject of Count 6, he was at a Chinese restaurant celebrating the birthday of MB, returning from the restaurant close to midnight. He denied being with DL and, in particular, denied that he was at home with DL from about 11.30 pm. This evidence was given after the ruling by Judge North.

162In a judgment dated 23 May 2012 the trial judge ruled that the complaint evidence of DL and KL should be admitted. He said that at the time of Judge North's ruling the alibi notice later tendered, which gave rise to the evidence of MB, had not been given. He noted that the appellant intended to introduce similar evidence to that given before Judge North and concluded that the evidence would, by implication, suggest fabrication by DL of his evidence of sexual assault on the night of the storm.

163The trial judge appeared to accept that mere denial does not constitute a suggestion of fabrication, but stated that the evidence went significantly beyond that to propose a positive geographical separation of the appellant from the location of the assault. In the circumstances he concluded, relying on s 108(3) of the Evidence Act, that it would not be in the interests of justice to permit the denial by the appellant and the evidence of MB to go unchallenged by the prior consistent statements of DL and KL.

164Thereafter DL gave evidence that in the 1990's he had a conversation with KL about the night of the storm and told her that he was working at the theatre and that he ""stayed in his [the appellant's] bed that night"".

165KL gave evidence that in 1991 DL told her that when the river flooded his parents let him stay at the appellant's home, they shared a bed and that ""Phil would touch [DL]'s penis and [DL] would touch Phil's penis"". KL said the conversation only occurred once, although in cross-examination she said they discussed obtaining counselling and that DL told her that it did happen again. The latter evidence was said to be inconsistent to that of DL.

The appellant's submissions

166The appellant submitted that this evidence should not have been admitted for a number of reasons. First, he submitted that having regard to the fact that there had been no application to revisit the ruling before Judge North after service of the alibi notice and, further, as it was put to the appellant in that trial that the incident took place after the period the subject of the alibi notice, it was not in the interests of justice that the ruling be revisited.

167Second, the appellant submitted that the evidence of DL was not evidence of complaint as it contained no reference to sexual misconduct. As set out above, DL's evidence was that he told KL he had stayed in the appellant's bed.

168Third, the appellant submitted that evidence of alibi is not a suggestion that evidence of a complainant is fabricated or reconstructed. He submitted that even if the evidence was capable of casting aspersions on the credit of DL, the question of leave remained. He submitted that for the reasons give in pars [166] and [167] above, the inconsistency between the evidence of DL and KL and the fact that the complaints were not fresh, leave should have been refused because the introduction of the evidence led to substantial unfairness in the context of a prior binding ruling.

169The appellant noted that the Crown case as put in the first trial was either that MB and the appellant were mistaken as to the time they returned from the dinner, or that the appellant was not at the dinner at all. The appellant submitted that the former scenario did not lead to the impossibility or geographical separation referred to by the trial judge.

170Finally, the appellant submitted that the evidence was inextricably linked to the earlier determination by Judge North under s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act refusing the appellant leave to cross-examine DL as to an alleged sexual encounter with another person which had occurred while he worked at a pizza shop. The evidence was said to reduce the substantial probative value of the complaint and to elevate the unfair prejudice to the appellant who could not test the evidence of DL or KL by reference to that complaint.

171Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that even if the evidence was admitted, it should only have been admitted for a credibility purpose and not to prove the truth of the statement. However, he accepted that no application was made under s 136 of the Evidence Act to limit the use which could be made of the evidence.

The Crown submissions

172The Crown submitted that no formal alibi notice had been given in the first trial. It was submitted that the application to adduce evidence of complaint to KL was made after cross-examination to the effect that no complaint had been made by DL to his father. It was said that Judge North rejected the Crown's application to adduce the evidence on the basis that his Honour did not see how a failure to complain to one person would ""open that up regarding this particular complaint"".

173The Crown submitted that the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant was implicitly suggesting that DL had fabricated his evidence on this issue. Reference was made particularly to the following cross-examination of DL at the first trial:

""Q. This storm that apparently - this incredible storm that took place that you told us about, are you absolutely certain that that occurred on the evening when you were taken to the accused's place of residence and there was this kind of mutual masturbation?A. Yes I'm sure.

Q. No, are you absolutely sure?A. Yes, I am. 

Q. There can't be any doubt in your mind that this was the night that this storm took place because the bridge was knocked out, was that correct?A. That's correct.""(23/09/2011 p 460)

...

""Q. Then the next paragraph if we can start there. You talk about moving his hips up and down and his penis rubbed against my hand, then you say after about an hour of Doyle masturbating and fondling my penis, you see that?A. Yes.

Q. Do we take that seriously, he's grabbing hold of your penis, masturbating for about an hour, is that right?A. Yes.

Q. All right. Now as we go over to the next paragraph he's - you are up to two hours there. Do you see paragraph 39, you've got the accused, Mr Doyle, with an erection throughout the two hours, do you see that?A. Yes.

Q. Are we take that as an expression of normal English words, he's got an erection for about two hours, is that right?A. Yes.

Q. But apparently during that instance or that incident you didn't get an erection, is that right?A. That is correct.""(23/09/2011 p 472-473)

Consideration

174Section 108 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:

""108(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness.

(2) (Repealed)

Note. The Commonwealth Act includes a subsection referring to section 105 of that Act.

(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 

(a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or

(b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion,

and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.""

175Also of relevance is s 192 of the Act. This provides:

""192(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 

(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d) the nature of the proceeding, and

(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.""

176Section 108(3)(b) is narrower than the general law insofar as it requires the leave of the court prior to the introduction of the evidence. However, the references to non-deliberate reconstruction and suggestion widen it, as does the omission of any requirement that the statement be made sufficiently early to be inconsistent with the evidence at the trial being a recent invention: J D Heydon, Cross on Evidence, (9th Aust ed 2013) at [17315].

177It has been stated that a mere denial of evidence does not suggest that the evidence was fabricated: R v Whitmore [1999] NSWCCA 247; (1999) 109 A Crim R 51 at [39]; cf Graham v The Queen [1998] HCA 61; (1998) 195 CLR 606 at [7]. However the appellant's case went well beyond that. The complaint related to an event on a specific identifiable date. The appellant not only denied the event but also gave notice that he proposed to lead evidence that he was not in the vicinity of where the event took place. When this is considered in conjunction with the cross-examination of DL at the first trial referred to in par [173] above, it seems to me that it was being at least suggested by implication that DL was fabricating his evidence. In Pavitt v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 88; (2007) 169 A Crim R 452 at [105], McColl JA and Latham J stated that there was no warrant for reading into s 108(3) a requirement that fabrication be explicitly raised or strongly inferred before the credibility rule is waived. Adams J who dissented in the result did not deal with this issue. In my opinion, in the present case, fabrication was in fact strongly inferred.

178It follows that the precondition to the grant of leave under s 108(3)(b) was made out.

179The appellant submitted that leave should not have been given. It was submitted that there was no application to revisit the ruling of Judge North at the first trial after the alibi evidence was adduced. I do not regard this as being of particular significance. DL had completed his evidence by that time and a forensic decision not to renew the application which would have involved recalling DL does not seem to be a matter which could prevent the discretion to grant leave being exercised in a retrial.

180The appellant submitted that the evidence of DL was not evidence of complaint. That may be so, but the evidence that he told KL ""I stayed in his bed that night"", referring to the night of the storm, was consistent with the version he gave at the trial, albeit not going as far as that version.

181The fact that the evidence of KL went further (see pars [164]-[165]) and thus was not entirely consistent with the evidence of DL did not provide a basis for declining to admit the evidence. Counsel for the appellant at trial was able, if he so desired, to cross-examine on such inconsistency.

182Whilst, in my opinion, the fact that the consistent statements were not fresh was relevant to the exercise of the discretion, it is not a precondition for leave being granted under s 108(3) of the Evidence Act. Although the statements were said to have been made some five years after the alleged incident, they were made well prior to the trial. Although the trial judge did not refer to this matter, he was expressly referred to the complaints being late in the argument that took place on the day of his ruling and in those circumstances there is no reason to doubt that he took this into account.

183Nor do I think the order made by Judge North under s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act, the subject of Ground 4, affected the position. No reliance was placed on that ruling in resisting the application under s 108 in the Court below. Further, while the evidence of both DL and KL expressly referred to the night of the storm and to the appellant, it does not seem to me that this ruling provided a sufficient basis for refusing leave.

184No application was made at the trial under s 136 of the Evidence Act to limit the use to be made of the evidence.

185It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 3 - The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding use of the evidence of complaint

186The trial judge gave the following written directions on the issue of complaint:

""'Complaint' Evidence Generally

The next direction I must give you concerns what is called 'complaint evidence'.

The Crown argues that this evidence supports the credibility of the complainants as witnesses, in that if you accept the evidence it may increase the weight which you give to the evidence as to the alleged sexual assaults with which the accused is charged.

As this evidence relates to statements allegedly made to other people in the past and outside the courtroom, it is referred to in law as 'hearsay evidence'. A 'complaint' witness merely repeats in court what that witness says the complainant said to him or her about the alleged incident. The person who is said to hear this complaint was not present to observe what occurred between the complainant and the accused as alleged in the indictment. Accordingly, a 'complaint' witness cannot give direct evidence about the actual alleged crime. You will, therefore, necessarily approach this evidence with caution.

I repeat that to meet the argument of the accused that the complainants' evidence is false, the Crown has led this evidence to show that the accused did in fact commit the offences charged.

If you accept that the complaint was made, then you may take it into consideration as some evidence of the fact that the sexual assaults alleged, relating to that complainant, actually took place.

Furthermore, if you accept that a complaint was made, that fact may also assist you in determining the weight to be given to the complainant's evidence here in court by a complainant as to the sexual assaults alleged against the accused.

[I will refer to the 'complaint' evidence.]

Delay in Complaint

The absence of a complaint or delay in making a complaint is a matter that you may take into account in assessing the credibility of a complainant's evidence as to what he said the accused did.

For some complainants, there was delay of decades between the alleged incident and the matters being reported to police.

The accused was first told about the Mark Lawrence allegations when approached by police in 1999, and was told about the allegations by the other four complainants when charged in 2009.

However I am required by law to direct you that a delay in complaint, even a long delay, does not necessarily mean that a complaint is false.

There may be good reasons why a person who has in fact been the victim of a sexual assault may fail to report, to delay in reporting, such an offence.

From your own knowledge of the world, you might think that there could be cases where embarrassment, guilt feelings or worry about the reactions of family or friends might cause a genuine victim of sexual molestation to suppress what had taken place.

In this trial, there may be good reasons which occur to you from the evidence why, if the complainants or any of them were actually molested in their youth, as alleged, they might maintain silence for a long time.

It is for you to evaluate such considerations. You should also take into account the evidence by the accused denying the occurrence of the offences.

Practical Problems for the Defence Caused by Long Delay in Reporting

There is a further warning I should give you relating to this issue of the absence of any or delay in complaint being made by complainants.

It is most important that you appreciate fully the effects of delay or absence of complaint on the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing prosecution evidence or bringing forward evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt.

[In this regard, I will refer to certain specific difficulties encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or in adducing evidence in his own case.]

These difficulties put the accused at a significant disadvantage in responding to the prosecution case, either in testing the prosecution evidence, or in bringing forward evidence him (sic) to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt, or both.

The delay means that the complainants' evidence cannot be fully tested as it otherwise might have been. Had the allegations been brought to light and the prosecution commenced much sooner, it would be expected that the complainant's memory for details would have been clearer. This may have enabled his evidence to be checked in relation to those details against independent sources so as to verify it, or to disprove it. The complainants' inability to recall precise details of the circumstances surrounding the incidents makes it difficult for the accused to throw doubt on his evidence by pointing to the circumstances which may contradict him. Had the accused learned of the allegations at a much earlier time he may possibly have been able to recall relevant details which could have been used by his counsel in cross-examination of the complainant.

Another aspect of the accused's disadvantage is that if he had learned of the allegations at a much earlier time he may have been able to find more witnesses or items of evidence that might have either contradicted the complainant or supported his case, or both. He may have been able to recall with some precision what he was doing and where he was at particular times on particular dates and to have been able to bring forward evidence to support him.

Because the accused has been put into this situation of significant disadvantage the conduct of his defence has been made more difficult. As a result, I warn you that before you convict the accused you must give the prosecution case the most careful scrutiny. In carrying out that scrutiny you must bear in mind the matters I have just been speaking about - the fact that the complainant's evidence has not been tested to the extent that it otherwise might have been and the diminished ability of the accused to bring forward evidence to challenge it, or to support his defence.

However, I am not telling you that these problems for the accused make it impossible for the prosecution to prove its case. If, after carefully considering my warnings and directions and scrutinizing the complainants' evidence with great care (in the context of all the other evidence) you are well satisfied of the truth and accuracy of the complainants' evidence in relation to any of the charges and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the alleged offences did occur, then it is your duty to return a verdict of guilty in relation to that matter.""(Emphasis in original)

187The trial judge gave the following oral directions:

""COMPLAINT EVIDENCE GENERALLY

The next direction I must give you concerns what is called complaint evidence. The Crown argues that this evidence supports the credibility of the complainants as witnesses. In that if you accept the evidence it may increase the weight which you give to the evidence as to the alleged sexual assaults with which the accused is charged. As this evidence relates to statements allegedly made to other people in the past and outside the courtroom, it is referred to in law as hearsay evidence. A complaint witness merely repeats in court what that witness says the complainant said to him or her about the alleged incident. The person who is said to hear this complaint was not present to observe what occurred between the complainant and the accused as alleged in the indictment. Accordingly, a complaint witness cannot give direct evidence about the actual alleged crime. You will therefore necessarily approach this evidence with caution.

To meet the argument of the accused that the complainant's evidence is false the Crown has led this kind of evidence, complaint evidence, to show that the accused did in fact commit the offences charged. If you accept that the complaint was made then you may take it into consideration as some evidence of the fact that the sexual assaults alleged relating to that complainant actually took place. Furthermore, if you accept that a complaint was made that fact may also assist you in determining the weight or value to be given to the complainant's evidence here in court by the complainant as to the sexual assaults alleged against the accused.

I will just interrupt myself there and mention the complaint evidence to you. Mark Lawrence made a statement to police on 13 January 1999 and that of course is a complaint, he said he flew down to Sydney on 13 January 1999 and gave his statement. Now you will recall that Mr Bentley, a police officer, referred to evidence that [EL] had reported the indecent assault of Mark Lawrence. I will just refer to that evidence. You will recall that Mr Bentley was the initial policeman involved in the case and he says at p 407, 'I had at about 7 pm on Monday 11 January 1999 I had a telephone conversation with a female person named [EL] who reported the indecent assault allegations on Mark Lawrence' and then he said on 13 January 1999 he spoke to Mark Lawrence and obtained the statement from him.

So far as [PM] is concerned, he told the Court that he had mentioned to his friend [NL], p 340 of the first trial, he said that 'he rang [NL] on the Sunday after the event that he alleged' and then he gave details to him on the following Monday. [NL] gave evidence about this, p 453 of this current trial. He said, 

'[PM] rang me up one day very upset and saying that there had been an incident between him and Philip Doyle.' He said, 'I can't remember if we talked about it on the phone or whether we met somewhere and talked about it. I remember the conversation but I don't remember where it took place but nonetheless he did. I know he did ring me and he was just very upset about that Mr Doyle had apparently given him some alcohol and had, I don't know, sexually assaulted him or molested him or something like that. I didn't ask for the specific details'.

Now that is complaint evidence and you understand that the nature of this evidence is that [NL] is not saying that he was anywhere where he saw himself anything taking place between [PM] and Mr Doyle, he was saying that that is what [PM] reported to him and it is what we call 'hearsay evidence'; and the significance that you attach to it is a matter for you. So far as [PM] bringing this to the attention of the police, Detective Senior Constable Lee gave evidence that on 26 August 2009 he was contacted by [PM] the day after a media release relating to the arrest of the accused Mr Doyle.

Now again turning to [DL]. [DL] told you that he made a complaint to [KL] his then wife (or [KL] as she was) and she gave evidence about that at p 243 in the following terms. She was referring to her relationship to him, she said they started living together in 1991 and he was working, amongst other places, at the Pizza Place at Kogarah. She said they were in a car at McDonald's, 'I don't know for whatever reason we just started talking about personal stuff'. She said they had been delivering pizzas. She said 'From what I remember he was telling me about when he was working at the Kogarah Mecca and he mentioned Phil Doyle and [DL] was about fourteen at the time and he was saying that there were no women or no girls kind of employed there'. Well that is of no great significance, but she was asked to focus on what he specifically told her and she said, p 243:

'Yes he told me about a time when it was raining and storming and the Georges River was flooded and he couldn't get home and he'd been at work that night and his parents were called to see if they come and pick him up and they couldn't get there and they gave the okay for [DL] to stay at Phil Doyle's place that night.

Q. Did [DL] say anything else about what happened that night?
A. He didn't want to go into too much detail but what he did say was that they shared a bed and that Phil would touch [DL's] penis and [DL] would touch Phil's penis and he seemed composed but he was kind of staring into the distance.'

In cross-examination she indicated that she had been separated from him six years ago and she said she was definite about having been told that, that Mr Doyle had been in bed with him and that there had been touching of the penis.

Now [DE] (you will recall, one of the workers at the Kogarah Mecca) gave evidence, amongst other things, on this subject, the subject of complaint. She said that she would occasionally work with [DL] on the same shift, p 367:

'We were in the candy bar and it's just normal chit chat but it was quiet and we weren't speaking at the time and then he just made the statement that something similar to 'Phil got me to pose for photos in my undies' and I didn't know how to react to that or what to say to it so I just kind of did a lame oh or something like that and he never pursued it any further and I never said anymore so it was just silence after that for quite a while.

Q. Did you ever have a further conversation with [DL] about what he had said?
A. No.'

Now that relates to the charge in count 7.

As for [KM], there is no complaint evidence. He said in his evidence that he had not revealed anything about it until after he saw the article in the paper and the arrest had occurred, and he contacted the police after 25 August 2009 and made his statement on 14 September 2009 and similarly with respect to [MH], there is no complaint evidence, he said he did not discuss it with anybody until he contacted the police in September 2009.

As I say to you that is complaint evidence, it is not eye witness evidence and you have to treat it with caution, but you are entitled to take it into account in the way that I have described.

Let me refer to delay in complaint. The absence of a complaint or delay in making a complaint is a matter that you may take into account in assessing the credibility of a complainant's evidence as to what he said the accused did. With some complainants there was a delay of decades between the alleged incident and the matters being reported to police.

The accused was first told about the Mark Lawrence allegations when approached by police in 1999 and was told about the allegations by the other four complainants when charged in 2009. However, I am required by law to direct you that a delay in complaint, even a long delay, does not necessarily mean that a complaint is false. There maybe good reasons why a person who has in fact been the victim of a sexual (sic) may fail to report or delay in reporting such an offence and from your own knowledge of the world you might think there could be occasions where embarrassment and guilt feelings or worry about the reactions of family or friends might cause a genuine victim of sexual molestation to suppress what had taken place.

In this trial there maybe good reasons which occur to you from the evidence why, if the complainant or any of them were actually molested in their youth as alleged, they might maintain silence for a long time. It is for to evaluate such considerations (sic). You should also take into account the evidence by the accused denying the occurrence of the offences.

PRACTICAL PROBLEMS FOR THE DEFENCE CAUSED BY A LONG DELAY IN REPORTING

There is further warning I should give you relating to this issue of the absence of any or delay in complaint being made by the complainants. It is most important that you appreciate fully the effects of delay or absence of complaint on the ability of the accused to defend himself by testing prosecution evidence or bringing forward evidence in his own case to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt. In this regard I will refer to certain specific difficulties encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or in adducing evidence in his own case. I will just refer to some of those matters, members of the jury.

One of them is the inability of each of complainant to remember some possibly important details in connection to the allegations of assault, in particular regarding the night of the big storm of 5 August 1986, each complainants' incapacity to recall with any precision the date, or in some cases the month upon which he was allegedly sexually assaulted or when he began and entered his employment with the Kogarah Mecca Centre. Again, another consideration is the unavailability of some Kogarah Mecca Theatre staff, now dispersed over the years, to give evidence about various matters raised in the defence case - for example, to confirm Mr Doyle's evidence as to the frequency with which the complainant, [KM], attended the Kogarah Mecca Cinema after he ceased employment there, and probably some other matters.

Another matter is the inability (because of the lapse of time) to have a proper inspection undertaken of Mr Doyle's former residence at [Sans Souci], particularly with respect to the presence or absence of an operative sauna about which the complainant [KM] gave evidence. The view of the swimming pool from the premises next door and, since there has been changes made, an inspection closer to the point in time of the allegations might have indicated the presence or absence of a pool table or a billiard table which [DL] says Mr Doyle allegedly had at his home at the time of the [MP]/[DT] masturbation incident.

Another matter which time affects is the unavailability of Mr Doyle's mother to give evidence upon the issue of whether Mr Doyle did take the complainant, [PM], to her place prior to the alleged occurrence in count 4 and the inability to find any persons she might theoretically have been entertaining at that time.

Another consideration related to delay is the unavailability of [DW] potentially to contradict evidence given by the complainant [PM] that Mr Doyle provided alcohol to [PM], [DW] and [NL]. Again, another matter that relates to delay is the unavailability of Robert Lopez to give evidence, in person - he has died. He might have given evidence and been tested in the witness box particularly with respect to his assertions of the complainant [DL] returning to work for the Kogarah Mecca around the mid 1990s and his recollection of paying [DL] cash for the two or three weeks he worked there at the time, and although there is a statement from him writing to Mr Lopez you do not have his evidence in person. Another consideration related to delay is the inability to identify persons nominated by [MB] as being at his [birthday party] on 5 August 1986.

Further, time and the lapse of time has made it impossible to have a proper inspection of the unit at Ozone Street, Cronulla as to how it was at the time of the allegations and particularly about whether there is an operative sauna or the presence or absence of a trap door in some part of the unit allegedly seen by the complainant [PM]. Again, I mention the inability to have had a proper inspection undertaken of the residence at [Sans Souci] again particularly with respect to the presence or absence of a working sauna about which the complainant [PM] gave evidence, and the presence or absence of a pool table which [DL] has mentioned and which I have already referred to.

Now these matters may not only have been affected by the long delay. It may be that the long passage of time has had an impact on Mr Doyle's ability to remember the details in connections with various allegations and so to assist his defence. For example, as appears at p 823 of the transcript, Mr Doyle's failure to remember putting an inscription in the book Mark Lawrence said was given to him upon Mr Doyle's return from America and another instance of his failure to recollect, which may well be attributable simply to the lapse of time, is the failure to remember whether Mark Lawrence rode in one of the vintage cars (that is at p.825) and Mr Doyle's recollection about the car that he drove on the evening of 5 August 1986 might well be affected by the lapse of time or the exact route he took to and from the city might similarly be affected; transcript p.882. Or, again, his inability to remember how much time per day he spent at the Hurstville Mecca Cinema; p.876.

Now, these difficulties are the kind which I have mentioned, put the accused at a significant disadvantage in responding to the prosecution case, either in testing the prosecution evidence or in bringing forward evidence to establish a reasonable doubt about his guilt, or both. This delay means that the complainant's evidence cannot be as fully tested as it otherwise might have been. Had the allegations been brought to light and the prosecution commenced much sooner, it would be expected that the complainant's memory for details would have been clearer. This may have enabled his evidence to be checked in relation to those details against independent sources so as to verify or to disprove it. The complainant's inability to recall precise details of the circumstances surrounding incidents makes it difficult for the accused to throw doubt on the evidence by pointing to circumstances which may contradict him. Had the accused learned of the allegations at a much earlier time, he might possibly have been able to recall relevant details which could have been used by his counsel in cross-examination of the complainant.

Another aspect of the accused's disadvantage is that if he had learned of the allegations at a much earlier time he may have been able to find more witnesses or items of evidence that might have either contradicted the complainant or supported his case or both. He may have been able to recall with some precision what he was doing and where he was at particular times on particular dates and to have been able to bring forward evidence to support him. Because the accused has been put into this situation of significant disadvantage, the conduct of his defence has been made more difficult. As I result I warn you that before you convict the accused you must give the prosecution case the most careful scrutiny. In carrying out that scrutiny you must bear in mind the matters I have just been speaking about. The complainant's evidence has not been tested to the extent that it otherwise might have been and there is a diminished ability of the accused to bring forward evidence to challenge it or to support his defence. 

However, I am not telling you that these problems for the accused make it impossible for the prosecution to prove its case. If, after carefully considering my warnings and directions and scrutinising the complainant's evidence with great care in the context of all the other evidence, you are well satisfied of the truth and accuracy of the complainant's evidence in relation to any of the charges and you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the alleged offences did occur, then it is your duty to return a verdict of guilty in relation to that matter.""(29/06/2012 pp 6-15)

The appellant's submissions

188The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that evidence of complaints as to particular counts could be used to support the credibility of the complainants as witnesses. He submitted that the direction was far too general, particularly where there was no complaint evidence for some of the complainants. Aligned to that he submitted that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that it could increase the weight given to the evidence in respect of all of the sexual offences and also in directing the jury that if they were satisfied the complaint was made, then it could be used as evidence for the fact that all of the counts took place.

189The appellant submitted that the trial judge summarised the evidence of complaint without confining it to particular counts. He submitted that the concluding words, ""As I say to you that is complaint evidence, it is not eye witness evidence and you have to treat it with caution, but you are entitled to take it into account in the way I have described"", reinstated the general directions in relation to the evidence of all the complainants.

190The appellant referred to Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297, in which the High Court emphasised the statutory preconditions to the admission of evidence of complaint contained in s 66 of the Evidence Act, including, that the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the complainant. He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [40] that there may well arise circumstances where use of complaint evidence would be limited.

191The appellant also referred to the fact that in the circumstances in Papakosmas supra, where there had been what the appellant described as spontaneous and immediate complaint, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J pointed out at [42] that a direction describing the hearsay evidence as ""'some evidence' in support of the charge was accurate, and did not overstate its importance."" He submitted that the circumstances in Papakosmas were very different to the circumstances in the present case.

192The appellant submitted that the precondition of ""fresh in the memory"" of the complainant was not satisfied in the case of DL's complaint to KL, or in the complaint of Mr Lawrence to his mother or the police some 19 years later and thus could not be used in support of Counts 6 or 7 in relation to DL, or Counts 1 to 3 in the case of Mr Lawrence.

193Further, so far as the evidence of the complaint to KL was concerned, the appellant referred to the acceptance by McHugh J in Papakosmas supra at [90] that the need for a discretionary limitation was much stronger when the evidence was admitted under s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act rather than s 66(2).

194The appellant submitted that the complaint recalled by DE from DL was not a case of sexual activity alleged in a particular count. In circumstances where the evidence of DE was different from that of DL, DE stating that DL told her that he was photographed in his underwear as distinct from the evidence of DL that he was photographed in Speedos, and also where no evidence was given by DL of a complaint to DE, the appellant submitted that the evidence was not available to support Count 7.

195The appellant submitted that the only evidence capable of use as truth of the facts was the complaint evidence of PM in relation to Counts 4 and 5.

196The appellant submitted that the errors in the direction regarding complaint constituted a miscarriage of justice.

197Senior counsel for the appellant pointed first to the trial judge's reference in his summing up to the statement by Mr Lawrence to the police on 13 January 1999, which he described as a complaint. Senior counsel for the appellant said it would have been better to say it was not a complaint, particularly having regard to the provisions of s 66(3) of the Evidence Act.

198Senior counsel for the appellant then referred to the trial judge's directions concerning the complaint by PM to NL, which he said was not specific to Count 4. In relation to PM's complaint to the police he made a similar submission to that which he made in respect of the complaint to the police by Mr Lawrence.

199Senior counsel for the appellant submitted the statement of complaint made by DL, which was admitted as a result of the application of s 108(3) of the Evidence Act, should only have been admitted for a credibility purpose and the jury should have been told that. He repeated the written submission that the complaint to DE was not capable of supporting Count 7.

200Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the effect of the directions was to elevate a whole list of matters which could not be complaints. He submitted that the combined effect of the directions was that all of the out of court representations were admissible to prove the facts.

The Crown submissions

201The Crown submitted that none of the matters the subject of the appeal on this ground were raised at trial. The Crown submitted that underlying the submission that complaint evidence generally could not be used as proof of the facts was an assertion that the evidence was wrongly admitted. The Crown pointed out that no objection to its admission was taken and no limitation under s 136 of the Evidence Act was sought.

202The Crown submitted that had objection been taken, consideration could have been given to the matters referred to in s 66(2A) of the Evidence Act.

203The Crown also pointed to the fact that the trial judge directed that there was no complaint evidence in respect of either KM or MH.

204Counsel for the Crown also pointed to the fact that the trial judge in his directions dealt with the problem of delay in relation to complaint evidence.

Consideration

205Section 66 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:

""66(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is available to give evidence about an asserted fact.

(2) If that person has been or is to be called to give evidence, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of the representation that is given by: 

(a) that person, or

(b) a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made,

if, when the representation was made, the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.

(2A) In determining whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of a person, the court may take into account all matters that it considers are relevant to the question, including: 

(a) the nature of the event concerned, and

(b) the age and health of the person, and

(c) the period of time between the occurrence of the asserted fact and the making of the representation.

Note. Subsection (2A) was inserted as a response to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606.

(3) If a representation was made for the purpose of indicating the evidence that the person who made it would be able to give in an Australian or overseas proceeding, subsection (2) does not apply to evidence adduced by the prosecutor of the representation unless the representation concerns the identity of a person, place or thing.

(4) A document containing a representation to which subsection (2) applies must not be tendered before the conclusion of the examination in chief of the person who made the representation, unless the court gives leave.""

206Apart from the evidence of complaint made by DL to KL there was no objection taken to the admission of the evidence of any of the other complaints, nor was there any application made under s 136 or s 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence or limit its use. Indeed, although the appellant at least implicitly suggested that some of the evidence was wrongly admitted, no ground of appeal was directed to that issue.

207Further, no objection was taken to the summing up of the trial judge on this point.

208Section 66(2A) was introduced into the Evidence Act following the decision of the High Court in Graham supra, where it was held that ""fresh"" means recent or immediate, its contemporaneity or otherwise being the most important consideration in any assessment of freshness. The approach to be adopted in the application of s 66(2A) was considered by this Court in R v XY [2010] NSWCCA 181; (2010) 79 NSWLR 629, where complaint of a sexual assault of a child under the age of 10 made between two and five years after the event was held to fall within the subsection. In holding that the evidence was admissible, Whealy J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated that the expression ""fresh in the memory"" was to be interpreted more widely than in Graham supra. He stated that it was not confined to an examination of the temporal relationship which, whilst relevant, was not determinative, as the nature of the event concerned must also be taken into account as an important consideration: Graham supra at [79] and [99].

209Thus, it is correct that in considering whether complaint evidence should be admitted consideration must be given to whether the statutory preconditions were made out and whether the use of the evidence should be limited pursuant to s 135, s 136 or s 137, Papakosmas supra at [34]-[35], [40], [44] and [90]-[94]. However, the preconditions must be considered having regard to the words of the statute in the manner discussed in XY supra.

210The trial judge did not have to give consideration to whether the preconditions were fulfilled as the evidence was admitted without objection. As was stated by McHugh J in Papakosmas supra at [72], in the absence of any objection no error of law was demonstrated either in the admission of the evidence or in the direction. Rule 4 applies and for the reasons set out hereunder no miscarriage of justice has been shown.

211The appellant complained that the trial judge's direction was far too general, particularly where there was no complaint evidence in relation to some of the complainants. I do not think this criticism is justified. As I indicated in dealing with Ground 1, the trial judge at the outset of his directions emphasised the need to consider the evidence on each count separately. Further, in each of his written and oral directions set out at pars [186] and [187] above, his Honour stated that ""If you accept that the complaint was made, then you may take it into consideration as some evidence of the fact that the sexual assaults alleged, relating to that complainant, actually took place"" (emphasis added). Further, in relation to the complaint evidence the trial judge dealt with each complaint separately and stated that there was no complaint in respect of KM or MH.

212It is correct as the appellant stated that the trial judge did not confine the complaint evidence to a particular count. However, with the exception of the complaint of DL to KL and PM to NL, the complaints did not relate to particular instances. That may have been relevant had any application been made to exclude or limit the evidence, but none was made.

213So far as the delay in the making of the complaints was concerned, this would also have been relevant had the admissibility of the evidence been challenged. However, the trial judge emphasised that the delay in the making of the complaints was a matter to be taken into account in assessing the credibility of the evidence, addressed the difficulties occasioned to the appellant by virtue of such delay occurring and had previously warned the jury of the caution to be used in assessing such evidence. In these circumstances I do not think the direction caused the appellant to lose the chance of an acquittal.

214In these circumstances this ground has not been made out.

Ground 4 - The trial miscarried as a result of the ruling of the trial judge in the first trial (binding in the second trial), erroneously refusing leave pursuant to s 293 Criminal Procedure Act to cross-examine the complainant DL about his alleged sexual experience with the pizza shop owner, Mr Bonica in the late 1980's

215In a statement to the police made on 7 September 2009, DL, in addition to alleging sexual misconduct by the appellant, asserted he was sexually assaulted by a Mr Robert Bonica, the proprietor of a pizza store where he worked in 1988 and early 1989. He alleged in the statement that he was sexually assaulted by Mr Bonica in April 1989 following which he immediately resigned his employment. The allegation made by DL against Mr Bonica was accurately summarised by the appellant in his written submissions in the following terms:

""For the first 6 months of his employment at the Pizzeria, Mr Bonica was friendly and made jokes about sexual things.

In around September or October of 1988, Mr Bonica starting complimenting him on his appearance and discussed homosexual experimentation.

Mr Bonica began giving him gifts, and in August 1988 gave him a gift for his birthday.

One night after work in November 1988, at the invitation of Mr Bonica he went to his unit in Hurstville and watched a pornographic video with Mr Bonica.

Around April 1989, Mr Bonica suggested that he and DL go to the Emperor's Garden Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. They arrived around midnight, ate a meal and left around 1.30am.

That evening after dinner at the Chinese restaurant, DL drove Mr Bonica back to his car. When they pulled up at the curb, Mr Bonica leant over from the passenger seat and rubbed DL's genitals in an attempt to get him aroused. He continued to rub his genitals for some minutes.

DL resigned after the incident where Mr Bonica rubbed his genitals.

DL returned to work for Mr Bonica around December 1990, delivering pizzas two nights a week. DL's then girlfriend, [KL], was pregnant and DL worked for Mr Bonica for 'a few months' over that period.""

216In dealing with the effect that the conduct alleged against the appellant had on him, DL made the following comments in his statement:

""67. I continued to work at the cinema for a few more months. I started to become a different person after the incidents. I felt dirty and was disgusted with myself, and I carried shame. My level of confidence in myself and my identity began to crumble, at a time when I was trying to find my identity as a young man. I would retreat from social situations with my friends and become a loner, keeping to myself a lot, feeling I had nothing good to offer anyone as a friend or person.""

217Ultimately, DL made the following comments in relation to the alleged conduct of both the appellant and Mr Bonica:

""86. These incidents involving Philip Doyle and Robert Bonica left me an empty and disillusioned person. Over the years I've felt many emotions including insecurity and these incidents have had a major influence on my confidence. Even today, I try and avoid coming into contact with men because I feel intimidated which is based on fear of being vulnerable. I am socially awkward and feel that I am weak willed and easily led due to my experiences with Doyle and Bonica. If I'm amongst a group of people who are laughing at a joke or a funny situation, I would rarely be relaxed enough to join in, and would never feel like part of the group. My humour developed into black humour after the incidents with Doyle. I see that whole period leading into my early 20's as a dark chapter of my life.""

218In the first trial the appellant sought leave to cross-examine DL on the incident concerning Mr Bonica. In a judgment delivered on 27 September 2011, Judge North declined to grant such leave, relying on the provisions of s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

219It was apparently argued before Judge North that the incident concerning Mr Bonica was disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution by the tender of the statement of DL at the committal proceedings. That submission was rejected by Judge North. Although it was contended on the appeal that Judge North erred in his application of s 293(6), this particular submission was not pressed at the appeal.

220Judge North also rejected the argument that s 293(6) was enlivened because the statement by DL in his evidence that he felt sick when the appellant asked him to put the appellant's penis into his mouth implied a lack of sexual experience such as to enliven the subsection. Judge North concluded that whether what occurred subsequently with Mr Bonica compounded DL's feelings of disgust or self-loathing, that could not be relevant to a fact in issue. On this basis he rejected the application.

221Although the appellant relied on s 293(4) in his submission before Judge North, his Honour did not deal with this argument, probably because it was not clear whether or not it was pressed.

222No application was made to revisit the ruling of Judge North at the trial.

The relevant legislation

223Section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides as follows:

""293(1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence.

(3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 

(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or

and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission.

(5) A witness must not be asked: 

(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or

(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.

(9) (Repealed).""

The appellant's submissions

224The appellant emphasised that this Court has made it clear on a number of occasions that the categories of exception in s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act should be construed broadly and in favour of the accused.

225The appellant submitted that the conduct alleged by DL against the appellant and against Mr Bonica were part of a connected set of circumstances within the meaning of s 293(4)(a)(ii), pointing to the fact that DL in par [86] of his statement to the police suggested his condition of feeling empty and disillusioned was a consequence of the incidents of abuse by both the appellant and Mr Bonica. He submitted that the similar allegations made against Mr Bonica and the timing and circumstances of the complaint made about the appellant to KL were so connected to the circumstances of the offence that it bore on DL's credibility and also the objective likelihood of two separate employers of DL acting in a similar fashion in the 1980s. He submitted that the timing of the complaint to KL may have suggested that DL was confused or transferring his anger against Mr Bonica to the appellant. He submitted that these were matters on which the appellant was entitled to cross-examine.

226The appellant also submitted that the case for the prosecution implied a lack of sexual experience such as to enliven s 293(6). He submitted that this followed from the evidence of DL that he felt introverted, withdrawn and dirty as a result of the incident. He submitted that s 293 and its predecessor were introduced into the legislation to prohibit irrelevant questioning of sexual assault victims as to their previous sexual behaviour. He stated that this was not the situation in the present case and the proposed questioning should have been allowed so the jury were appraised of all the circumstances, particularly when the prosecution was allowed to lead evidence of complaint and the trial judge permitted that evidence to be used as evidence of the fact that the offences occurred.

227The appellant submitted that given the relevance of the evidence there was no rational forensic purpose in not seeking to revisit the ruling of Judge North, particularly when evidence of complaint was allowed to be introduced. He also submitted that the prosecutor should have drawn the attention of the trial judge to the different context in which the ruling of Judge North was made.

228The appellant submitted that the failure to permit this cross-examination deprived the appellant of a real chance of an acquittal.

229The appellant further submitted that even if Judge North and the trial judge had correctly applied s 293, this Court retained a residual discretion to allow an appeal on this ground on the basis that there was a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant was deprived of a real chance of acquittal. In this context the appellant referred to the decision of this Court in R v Morgan (1990) 30 NSWLR 543. Senior counsel for the appellant noted that the Crown did not contend that the case was wrongly decided. Senior counsel also submitted that s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act was broad enough to deal with the situation, referring to Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; (2008) 236 CLR 358.

The Crown submissions

230The Crown submitted that the ultimate question was whether the appellant lost the chance of an acquittal which was fairly open to him as a result of the refusal to permit cross-examination on the incident involving Mr Bonica.

231The Crown submitted there was no obligation on the prosecutor to apply to revisit the ruling of Judge North when defence counsel had not done so.

232The Crown submitted that the argument based on s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act was abandoned before Judge North, but in any event it was erroneous.

233The Crown placed particular reliance on what was said by this Court in GEH v R [2012] NSWCCA 150, in which similar submissions to those made by the appellant in this case were made in respect of two sets of alleged sexual offences. The time difference between the alleged offences was between 8 and 15 months. The Crown submitted that the appeal in GEH v R supra was dismissed because of a failure to demonstrate that the incident sought to be introduced occurred at or about the same time as the incident the subject of the charge or formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed. In the present case the Crown pointed out that the time difference between the incidents involving the appellant and those involving Mr Bonica was 23 months.

234The Crown submitted that Judge North was correct in the conclusion he reached concerning s 293(6). In that context counsel for the Crown emphasised that DL had said in his statement (at par [67]) that the feelings of dirt, disgust and shame arose from his encounters with the appellant.

Consideration

235For the exception to the prohibition in s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act contained in s 293(4)(a) to apply, both limbs of the subsection must be satisfied. In the present case the alleged offences by the appellant against DL took place in 1986 and 1987, the last being in March or April 1987. The incident with Mr Bonica was alleged to have taken place in April 1989 some two years later. Accepting that the section is to be construed liberally in favour of the accused (see for example R v Morgan supra at 551), it does not seem to me that the sexual activity alleged against Mr Bonica took place at or about the time of the commission of the offences alleged by DL against the appellant.

236Further, I do not think that the precondition in s 293(4)(a)(ii) is satisfied. The question is whether the two complaints of sexual activity, namely, the alleged assaults by the appellant and the alleged assault by Mr Bonica, formed part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed offences, being the offences by the appellant, were committed. There does not seem to be a connection between the alleged assaults by the appellant and the alleged assault by Mr Bonica. The fact that complaints to the police were made at the same time does not demonstrate the events formed part of a connected set of circumstances.

237I do not think the fact that the statement could be used in some way to test the credit of DL affects the position. Two alternatives were suggested by the appellant. He suggested that if the statement were true it would suggest that DL was transferring his anger against Mr Bonica to the appellant. Alternatively, if it were false, it could demonstrate that DL had a predilection for making false complaints. Either way the relevant event itself, being the alleged assault by Mr Bonica, did not form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed. Although the complaint against Mr Bonica might go to the credit of DL, it was not so connected to the commission of the offences alleged that it bore on the objective likelihood of their commission: see GEH v R supra at [81]-[82].

238Further, in my opinion the evidence did not fall within s 293(6). As I pointed out, DL said in his statement at par [67] that he felt disgusted with himself and carried shame as a result of the alleged assaults by the appellant. This was stated separately to the feelings that he said he felt after the further alleged assault by Mr Bonica. It does not seem to me that the statement implied any lack of sexual experience such as to enliven s 293(6). The feelings that were referred to by DL could be held equally by a person with or without a lack of sexual experience. It does not seem to me that DL stating that he had these feelings after the assaults by the appellant implied a statement that he lacked sexual experience.

239Further, the case of the prosecution made no reference to the alleged assault by Mr Bonica. Cross-examination as to his experience at a later time after the assaults the subject of the charges took place could have no relevance to his sexual experience or lack thereof at the time the alleged assaults by the appellant occurred.

240In these circumstance, Judge North was correct in refusing leave to cross-examine DL in relation to his alleged sexual experience with Mr Bonica.

241The appellant submitted that even if this was the case the exclusion of the evidence, particularly coupled with the admission of the evidence of the complaint made by DL to KL, meant either that its exclusion or the admission of that complaint evidence led to a miscarriage of justice.

242In that context the parties accepted that even if the evidence was correctly rejected, the appeal could be allowed if there was a miscarriage of justice: R v Morgan supra at 554; cf R v Berrigan (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 7 October 1994, unreported); contra HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2; (1999) 197 CLR 414 at [47] and [150]-[153].

243I have already dealt with the reasons that the trial judge was correct in admitting the evidence of the complaint made by DL to KL.

244Further, I do not think that the fact that the evidence of the alleged assault by Mr Bonica was excluded, whether coupled with the admission of the complaint evidence or otherwise, led to a miscarriage of justice.

245On the material available the evidence would have gone no further than showing that DL had made a complaint against another person relating to an incident some two years later. There was no evidence to suggest that this complaint was true or false. It does not seem to me that there was a real chance that a jury having accepted the evidence of DL beyond reasonable doubt would reach a different conclusion solely based on the fact of another complaint, absent any evidence as to whether the further complaint was accurate or otherwise. In these circumstances, in my opinion, there was no miscarriage of justice.

246My opinion is not altered by the fact that the complaint to KL was admitted. That complaint was specific both as to the identity of the offender and the time it took place. It does not seem to me that in those circumstances the account that a jury would take of a complaint concerning a specific instance would be affected by the fact that a complaint in relation to a different incident had been made at a much later point in time.

247It follows in those circumstances that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 5 - The learned trial judge erred in (a) Allowing Mr Tenant to be cross-examined by the prosecution under s 38 Evidence Act 1995 and (b) Allowing Mr Tenant to be recalled to give ""supplementary evidence"" for the prosecution

248Mr Robert Tenant worked at the theatre from 1973 when he was aged 16 until 1991, rising to the position of general manager.

249In the course of his evidence in chief Mr Tenant stated that he could not recall if a fridge with wine in it was in his office at the theatre. By contrast, in his evidence in the first trial he said that there was wine in the fridge in his office on occasions.

250Mr Tenant also gave evidence that he and the staff generally finished work around midnight. This was in contrast to a statement he had made in 1999 in which he said quite often ""we would be working late until the early hours of the morning"".

251Mr Tenant's evidence was that PM was never employed at the theatre. He described him as KM's ""hang-on brother"", recalling he was about 10 years of age.

252During the course of Mr Tenant's evidence in chief the Crown Prosecutor made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Mr Tenant: first, by showing him his early evidence concerning wine in the fridge (the first application); second, by showing him that part of his statement which referred to working into early hours of the morning (the second application); third, by showing him a promotional flyer to suggest that he was wrong about PM being 10 years old and not being employed at the theatre (the third application); and, fourth, showing him a reference which stated that KM was employed as an usher (the fourth application). 

253Mr Tenant's evidence had been that he could not recall KM very well, he did not remember interviewing him and it was unlikely that he was employed by the appellant without first being interviewed by Mr Tenant.

254Following these applications the following exchange occurred:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: If I am going to put to the jury that he is wrong about these matters I ought to give him the opportunity-

HIS HONOUR: Correct himself, yes. Well, if you could get the evidence he's given today - it's basically a prior inconsistent statement, is it not?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Prior inconsistent statement in relation to the evidence he gave on the last occasion.

HIS HONOUR: And you say unfavourable?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: And unfavourable, your Honour, yes.

HIS HONOUR: What's your attitude about that, Mr Terracini?

TERRACINI: First of all, he's not my witness; secondly, it's a regular application by Crowns that witnesses are unfavourable which I find quite offensive to a lot of witnesses. Prior inconsistent is a far more neutral situation. They're just shown their statements and say, 'Look do you agree or not?' I don't think that he should be an unfavourable witness.

HIS HONOUR: You don't think he should be an 'un' what?

TERRACINI: I don't think that there's a basis for demonstrating he's unfavourable.

HIS HONOUR: At this stage anyway the Crown is basically saying he said different things. Yes, that's the case, isn't it, Madam Crown?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: He said the same thing about [PM], he said the same thing about [KM], but if I'm going to submit the jury he's wrong I have the obligation to seek to put the material to him.

TERRACINI: Well as I stated it's not my witness, I got it on the first trial your Honour's dealt with and other than a meet and greet I've had no dealings with Mr Tenant so I don't want to be in the situation of suggesting that we seek to protect him in any shape or form.

HIS HONOUR: Well you can show - do you have any objection to the Crown showing him the - is there a flyer?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: There is, it's a, what's the words, a brochure for the pantomime naming [PM] as the usher. There is a reference signed by Phillip Doyle for [KM] commencing his work as an usher. There are-

HIS HONOUR: Not signed by Mr Tenant?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No by Mr Doyle. But it would be clear that [KM] was employed during the time that Mr Tenant was the manager, according to that reference.

TERRACINI: And I think that the reference will fall in a way where this witness is saying that he was around; he's obviously doing something but I don't have much memory of him and if his figure of about 100 ushers accurate, and it seems to be approaching that number, then it's hardly surprising that he doesn't know every single person.

HIS HONOUR: Well Madam Crown in general I'll let you put these things to him without any necessity to - we've gone well beyond hostility and there's no suggestion of that but it may well - I can see he's unfavourable. Point the differences out to me tomorrow morning and give me a copy of the flyer and so on and I'll consider it further.""(30/05/2012 pp 260-261)

255On the following day the trial judge was shown the material said to give rise to the inconsistency and, ultimately, the following exchange took place between the trial judge and senior counsel for the appellant:

""HIS HONOUR: Well it doesn't seem at this stage as if he has been adverse in the sense of not trying to do his best. But in all those matters, prima facie it seems to me that you should be entitled to ask him appropriately leading questions. The, Mr Terracini this is not rip and tear stuff I think the Crown could legitimately put those matters.

TERRACINI: Well your Honour all the Crown has to do is to say 'I want to show you he was born on such and such a date' there's no issue about it your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Exactly.

TERRACINI: If he's never said as I understand, he never said that he does remember anything, but that's not surprising.

HIS HONOUR: No, no, I think that Madam Crown is just being very cautious. I think that's right. Madam Crown if you start to cross-examine this witness I'll, in any vigorous fashion I'll stop you.""(31/05/2012 pp 265-266)

256As a result, the following questions were asked of Mr Tenant by the Crown Prosecutor without objection from the defence:

""Q. And your recollection is that [PM] would have been about ten when you first met him?A. As I recall yes, he was only young.

Q. Now in relation to the pantomimes, if there are pantomimes done at the end of year over three years that involves [KM] being Hansel and Gretel, her first pantomime. Little Red Riding Hood her second pantomime and Cinderella her third pantomime. In relation to [PM] and when your recollection is he is ten years old, would that have been at the start?A. I really don't recall. I don't know how old he was, I just thought he was around about ten when you mentioned it

Q. What I want to do is suggest that [PM] was actually born in December of 1968, so by 1983 when the May Jack and the Beanstalk pantomime was on the boy would have been actually fourteen years old?A. Maybe yeah.

Q. And that he was actually employed to work on the Hansel and Gretel pantomime as an usher and that pantomime was January 1984?A. [PM] was never employed as an usher.

Q. Front of House, is that duty usher duties?A. Yes.

Q. If the witness could please be shown this, which is a copy of exhibit NN from the previous proceedings. Mr Tenant looking at that, does that appear to be a copy of an official souvenir program for the Mecca Theatre production of Hansel and Gretel?A. Yes.

Q. A production that was performed at the Mecca Theatre Kogarah, January 9 to 21 of 1984?A. Yes.

Q. If I can take you to the last page of that document. It gives a list of people that the Hansel and Gretel show spectacular wishes to thank the following people for their devoted assistance to the show?A. Yes.

Q. [PM] is listed as Front of House, isn't he?A. Yes I can see that.

Q. Having seen that do you concede it is possible that [PM] did actually work as an usher on that performance and you just don't recall him at this stage?A. I don't recall [PM] working.

...

Q. During the course of giving evidence I want to suggest to you that these questions were asked and these were the answers you gave, referring to page 292, 'Q. During the time of 1986 do you know if there was often alcohol kept in the theatre manager's fridge, wine?' and your answer, 'Yeah, there would have been wine on occasions'. Next question, 'Was there a fridge up in the office that you had, the office that was on the street level?' and your answer was 'Yes'?A. Yes, I thought about it after you talked to me yesterday and there was a fridge there, a little bar fridge.

Q. And the little bar fridge that was in the office that you occupied was that a little bar fridge where there was often wine kept?A. It was in the kitchen area, it wasn't in my office.

Q. Last year you certainly agreed that the all right was kept in the that manager's fridge, you said, 'Yes, there would have been wine on occasions'?A. Yes. The fridge was in the kitchen area which was around that corner from where I sat.

Q. But just focussing on the theatre manager's fridge, the fridge that was in your office?A. No there was never a fridge in my office. I was referred to the theatre's manager's fridge as the fridge that was in the kitchen because there was fridges in the candy bar.

Q. Right but last year when you were asked, 'Was there a fridge up in the office that you had, the office that was on street level?' and your answer was 'Yes'?A. Well the office, the kitchen is on street level as well.

...

Q. I suggest that during the time it was closed for renovations that [KM] would on occasions come to the cinema to help take rubbish away with the accused?A. No that wouldn't have happened.

Q. Could this document please be shown to the witness which is exhibit CC from the previous proceedings. Does it appear to be a reference signed by, or a copy of reference signed by Phillip W Doyle?A. Yes.

Q. On Mecca Movies City letterhead?A. Yes.

Q. Dated November 7, 1993?A. Yes.

Q. So by that stage you were no longer working for the Kogarah Mecca?A. No.

Q. The first line, 'I have known [KM] in the capacity of friend and employee for a period of almost five years'?A. Yes.

Q. Given the timeframe of that reference that would take us back to at least 1989?A. Yes.

Q. Is it possible that [KM] was employed at the Kogarah Mecca Theatre having seen that reference from then starting May 1989 and you just don't recall that boy?A. I just don't recall him. I did all the hiring and firing and I don't recall [KM] ever working for us.

Q. But is it possible that he is just one of the many employees, that you just don't recall him?A. Yes.

Q. But he did work there from May 1989 to the middle of 1991?A. Well I don't recall him working there in that timeframe.

...

Q. I show you a copy of this document. Does that appear to be a copy of the statement that you made at the Southport Police Station in 1999?A. Yes.

Q. At the time you made that statement and you were asked questions specifically about the early 1980s would your recollection have been better that it is now?A. I don't know. I don't know how to measure that.

Q. Well 1999, 19 - 17 years after the event do you think your recollection would have been better than it is now when I'm asking you questions 32 years later?A. Possibly.

Q. I ask you to have a look at page 2 of that statement. I'm going to read the very bottom paragraph or part of it 'When Mark worked his mother or father would drop him off and pick him up again at the end of the night'. Were you referring there to Mark Lawrence.A. Yes.

Q. 'A lot of the times Mark would be dropped off by someone working there instead of having his mother or father coming for him', is that what you said?A. Yes.

Q. You go on to say 'Quite often we would be working late until the early hours of the morning or some staff would stay back after work and have a social chat and a few drinks together'?A. Yes.

Q. So at that stage in 1999 what you included in your statement was 'quite often we would working late until the early hours of the morning'?A. I was referring to myself and Phil Doyle there.

Q. Is that straight after you've spoken about when Mark worked his mother or father would drop him off and pick him up again at the end of the night. A lot of times Mark would be dropped off by someone working there instead of having his mother or father come to him. Quite often we would be working until the early hours of the morning or some staff would stay back after work and have a social chat and a few drinks together?A. Some staff would have been the adults, Phil, myself.

Q. But in relation to working until the early hours of the morning the projectionist would have to stay until the end of the film, wouldn't they?A. Correct.

Q. And if the projectionist was getting a lift home with Philip Doyle would he also be there until the early hours of the morning?A. No. The young staff would have been taken home straight away.

Q. But the ushers they finished up earlier, didn't they?A. Some did, some stayed.""(31/05/2012 pp 275-284)

257Earlier in his evidence Mr Tenant had given the following evidence concerning gifts to staff:

""Q. During the time that you were employed at the Kogarah Mecca cinema did you receive any gifts from Phillip Doyle yourself?A. Oh he might have - t-shirts when he went overseas, things like that but nothing, nothing major, no.

Q. Were you aware of any other members of staff being given any gifts by Mr Doyle?A. Small things, a box of chocolates, that sort of thing, nothing, nothing huge.""(31/05/2012 p 268)

258Mr Tenant had given evidence at the first trial that the appellant had not given any gifts to staff. In these circumstances the Crown Prosecutor made an application under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Mr Tenant on that statement (the fifth application). The application was in the following terms:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour just on the basis that is again evidence it was inconsistent with the evidence that he has given here today only gifts.

HIS HONOUR: And it what?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Only gifts. He said today that there were gifts given. That he recalls gifts being given, T-shirts, chocolates, things like that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: And last year he said there not any gifts.

HIS HONOUR: What's the point of, what's the significance of that?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The significance is that gift giving for the ushers is exceptional behaviour by accused, consistent with the tendency evidence. The other staff at the Kogarah Mecca to his knowledge during the time that he worked there were never given any gifts.

HIS HONOUR: What did he say this morning. He said that occasionally there would be chocolates or T-shirts or something.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: T-shirts, things brought back from overseas trips. I didn't have an exact note in relation to it but certainly consistent with him coming back and giving gifts.

HIS HONOUR: Well it seems to be inconsistent but is that the only questioning about gifts in the previous trial of this witness.""(31/05/2012 p 280)

259Mr Tenant was then cross-examined on the voir dire in relation to the prior statement. Following that the trial judge made the following remark:

""That probably covers the field Madam Crown. I mean I will allow you to remind him of that evidence in front of the jury. And he can explain it. I won't allow you to cross-examine him about the matters of discussion, certainly at this stage anyway.""(31/05/2012 pp 281-282)

260The application does not appear to have been opposed by senior counsel for the appellant at the trial.

261Thereafter, Mr Tenant was questioned on this matter to the following effect:

""Q. Mr Tenant, in relation to the evidence that you gave on 15 September last year I want to suggest that you were also asked this question and gave this answer:

'Q. During the time that you worked with Philip Doyle were you aware of him or do you have any knowledge of any gifts being given to any members of staff?'

and your answer was 'No'. Do you agree that was the evidence that you gave in September of last year?A. Yes.

Q. You were then asked 'Did you receive any gifts?' And your answer was 'No', do you agree that was the evidence that you gave in September of last year?A. Yes.""(31/05/2012 p 283)

262During cross-examination Mr Tenant gave evidence concerning a sauna at the appellant's premises. This evidence was to the following effect:

""Q. Have you got any memory of being in that or seeing it?A. I remember seeing it. It was used as a storage area. It didn't work.

Q. Storage for what, do you have any memory of that?A. It had boxes in it. I'm not sure what was in the boxes.

Q. And in terms of steps leading down to the water from the Ozone Street place at Cronulla, have you got any memory of seeing them?A. Yes.

Q. Was that attached to his property in the sense that it was part of the Certificate of Title of the property or was it used by anybody who was on the site of the home unit block?A. It was used by anybody.

Q. So as it were a set of stairs going down from the front side of the home unit down to the water?A. Correct.""(31/05/2012 pp 298-299)

263Mr Tenant gave the following evidence at the first trial:

""Q. With respect to the property at Cronulla, Ozone Street, Cronulla, was there any discussion or any conversation that you heard about doing the same thing to the sauna at Cronulla, that is turning it into a development room as opposed to a sauna?A. I don't really recall, so I think there was a sauna down there but I never used it and I never paid much attention to it.

Q. But there's no doubt that there were steps leading down to the beach?A. Correct.

Q. They could be readily accessed?A. Easily accessed yes.""(15/09/2011 pp 310-311)

264At the conclusion of the cross-examination of Mr Tenant by senior counsel for the appellant at the trial, the Crown Prosecutor applied to further question him. This application (the sixth application) concerned two matters. First, that Mr Tenant had declined to make a statement to the police after 1999 and, second, inconsistent evidence concerning a sauna at the appellant's premises. The first matter was said to constitute re-examination, while reliance was placed on s 38 of the Evidence Act in respect of the second matter. It is necessary to refer to the exchange between the Crown Prosecutor and the trial judge concerning the application:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour rather than yo-yoing the jury in and out, if I could just indicate in relation to the evidence that was given regarding the sauna in cross-examination I am going to be applying to question the witness about what he said in the previous trial about that in re-examination and there are other matters where he was asked about whether the police had asked him for certain things, I'd also want to ask him about the fact that he declined a number of requests from the police to make a statement post 1999.

TERRACINI: I don't mind that your Honour because we can ask him about the police harassment when they were trying to interview his eleven year old daughter and saying to them that he was not being co-operative because he allegedly knew far more. And then they turned up at his house when he was absent and then started speaking to his daughter. So no doubt that will all come out. That's the reason why he decided he wouldn't be making any further statements to the police.""(31/05/2012 p 315)

265The trial judge suggested the application be considered at the conclusion of the cross-examination. Thereafter, the following exchange took place:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour yesterday the witness gave evidence at page two hundred and-

HIS HONOUR: So this is an application under-

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It's an application to cross-examine the accused in relation to prior inconsistent statements.

HIS HONOUR: So this is section?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: S 38.

HIS HONOUR: I'll just get the transcript. Yesterday's transcript is it?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Which page?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Starting at page 298 yesterday.

HIS HONOUR: Two ninety-eight, right. Which line?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Commencing at line 48 in relation to the sauna at Ozone Street, the witness said he remembered seeing it, 'It was used as a storage area, it didn't work, it had boxes in it, I'm not sure what was in the boxes'. Last year when he was asked about the sauna at page 284 at line 4 he was asked, 'Q. The unit at Ozone Street, do you know whether or not there was any sauna at that unit? A. I believe so, I recall - I don't - I never went in it, it was downstairs I believe.'.

HIS HONOUR: Two eight-four, right. So Ozone Street is at Cronulla is it?""(01/06/2012 p 326)

266Following further discussions the following remarks were made:

""TERRACINI: I mean to the chase, if my friend in normal re-examination wants to say, 'On a number of occasions you were asked to make a statement to the police and you declined' well there can't be an objection to that, as long as your Honour tells the jury that a private citizen doesn't have to make statements to police, there's nothing wrong with that. And again if my friend says, 'Well you had a conference with Mr Bowe' I couldn't object to that either because it's a fact. But your Honour would need to tell the jury that he doesn't have to speak to Mr Bowe either but he did, and there's nothing wrong with that either.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I'm content with that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well on that point I think that's the position that we'll follow. Are we clear on that?

...

HIS HONOUR: All right. Now as to Mr Terracini, as to the sauna matter, plainly that's an inconsistency isn't it?

TERRACINI: Yes well again I emphasise that we don't act for him but I agree that there is an inconsistency. I don't agree though that the stairs are. It still has to be a meaningful inconsistency. Maybe I'm missing something, I just don't see any significance. The staircase existed, there's no question about that. And it leads down to the water and.

HIS HONOUR: I suppose the place hasn't been blown up since then has it or? Demolished to make way for a Taj Mahal?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No the police officer-

TERRACINI: No it's still there.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: -has been to the outside and has certain photographs-

TERRACINI: Yes there's photographs your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well are there photographs inside and outside or?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Not inside.

TERRACINI: No not inside.

HIS HONOUR: Look well Madam Crown on that point you can clarify, it seems to me, find out what you can about it but not so as to cross-examine about credibility. On the sauna business it seems to me that there clearly is, within terms of s 38, a prior inconsistent statement, and if you wish to go further than that and deal with issues of credibility in relation to it, you will need to make another application to me. At the risk of irritating the jury but you may cross-examine about that.

In terms of the scope of that cross-examination I am inclined to adopt the approach of Mr Justice Hayden (sic) that the section is only meaningful if it eventually might allow questions with a view to shaking the witness' credibility but you don't get to that point. You certainly don't get to that point right now. We'll see what the witness says.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour so I, to raise it, I also wish to put to him the evidence given at p 310 from 15 September in relation to the Ozone Street sauna.

HIS HONOUR: 310?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Lines 45 to 50. Cross-examination.

HIS HONOUR: This is the last trial?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is the last trial.

HIS HONOUR: That's at 310. This is about a development, being turned into a development room, a camera room is it? 310 as distinct from-

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. Well 310 he said in chief in relation to the sauna-

HIS HONOUR: Sorry where I'm just losing the plot here. We're talking about the first trial or yesterday?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: The first trial 310.

HIS HONOUR: All right which line?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Line 45. 'With respect to the property at Ozone Street, Cronulla, was there any discussion or any conversation you heard about doing the same things you saw at Cronulla. That is turning it into a development room as opposed to the sauna?'. 'But I don't really recall, so I think there was a sauna down there but I've never used it and I never paid much attention to it.'.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. All right, whereas yesterday he said?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Whereas yesterday in his evidence about the sauna in cross-examination was, 'I remember seeing it, it was'-

HIS HONOUR: But which page?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Page 298.

HIS HONOUR: Yes?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Lines 38 to 46.

HIS HONOUR: Well there appears to be a contradiction there. And you can ask him to explain that contradiction. And then I won't let you take it any further unless you make a - in the light of what he says, unless you make a further application. What I mean by that is, that you may conduct yourself like a probing questioner but not like a destructive question, if I can use the term from one of the cases on the subject, unless and until I give any further direction about it. But on the face of it there's a clear contradiction. He may just say well he remembers now, I don't know. And that's matter for submissions in due course. But there is a contradiction and you can certainly ask him questions about that. We may need to revisit it, I don't know. But you can ask those questions. Do you agree with that Mr Terracini?

TERRACINI: Yes your Honour, my position is only by way of a suggestion. It seems uncontradicted that he wasn't given a copy of his evidence which was lengthy, in fairness to him, perhaps if we can have a morning tea break, he can see the transcript and then at least he's got the opportunity to see what he said and he may well just say, 'Oh look I've made an error.'.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour I don't believe it's ever appropriate for the Crown to give witnesses copies of their transcript from prior trials.

HIS HONOUR: No well we wont do that no.

TERRACINI: Your Honour I'm not suggesting that there is anything improper but he did give a lengthy period of evidence and he doesn't have any aide memoirs of any kind.

HIS HONOUR: Well that's all right the Crown is not going to cross examine him destructively, as I said she can certainly probe with questions about that and we'll see what happens, there may well be another matter of law. Well are we clear on those points?

TERRACINI: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Very well, we'll have the jury. Is that all of the re examination of - or there may be other matters that you wish to deal with that don't necessarily require any contention.""(01/06/2012 pp 332-335)

267Thereafter the following evidence was given without objection:

""Q. Do you recall in the previous trial you were also asked about the sauna at Ozone Street Cronulla?A. Probably yes, I don't recall the exact question.

Q. Well I suggest to you last year when I was asking you questions at page 284 line 4, you were asked this question, the unit at Ozone Street do you know whether or not there was any sauna at that unit, and your answer was, I believe so I recall I don't I never went in it, it was downstairs I believe. Was that the evidence that you gave in relation to that sauna last year when you were asked about it?A. If you say so, yes.

...

Q. Between that occasion when you said that you never went in it and it was downstairs I believe, you haven't had any opportunity to go and have a look at those premises have you?A. No.

Q. But yesterday you said that it was used as a storage area and you remembered seeing boxes in it?A. Yes.

Q. You were also asked in cross examination last year another opportunity in relation to the sauna at Ozone Street at page 310, you were asked this question in cross examination, with respect to the property at Cronulla Ozone Street Cronulla was there any discussion or any conversation that you heard about doing the same thing to the sauna at Cronulla, that is turning it into a development room as opposed to a sauna. And the answer you gave, I don't really recall so I think there was a sauna down there but I never used it and I never paid much attention to it. Do you recall if that was the evidence that you gave last year when you were asked in cross examination about the sauna at Ozone Street?A. If that's what's there.

Q. What's changed between last year when you told a jury that you never went in it, 'It was down there I believe', and when you told the jury that 'I never used it and I never paid much attention to it', compared to yesterday when you detailed it being used as a storage area, 'It didn't work, it had boxes in it.'. What's changed since you gave the evidence last year and giving evidence yesterday?A. I guess time, had time to think about it and reflect, that was asked - the first questions were asked me with no notice or anything to remember a sauna. You don't have a chance to think about it.

Q. Well you were asked questions by me about the sauna and then my learned friend went to the sauna again in cross-examination so you certainly got asked questions about the sauna last year on two occasions and fairly consistent accounts that you hadn't paid much attention to it and you'd never been down there?A. I'd never been in it to have a sauna.

Q. So the evidence you gave on oath last year on two occasions when you said you'd never been in it and you never paid much attention to it, that evidence that you gave you now say is wrong?A. I gave evidence at the time that I thought was correct. As I said, I've had time - this has been going a long time, you start to remember different things. The sauna meant nothing to me, I'd never used the sauna there.

...

Q. But as of 2009 you've said that there were a number of approaches by the police-A. Yes.

Q. -asking you to make a statement?A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever actually meet up with the police where they may have had any opportunity to show you any photographs or any documents or any materials?A. No, no.

Q. And was that by your choice?A. Yes.

Q. Prior to the trial in September last year did you have a conference with any lawyers?A. I had Michael Bowe visited me at my place of work.""(01/06/2012 pp 336-338)

268No direction was ultimately given to the effect that Mr Tenant had no obligation to speak with the police.

269There was subsequently an application to recall Mr Tenant to give evidence concerning the ownership of a truck which Mr Tenant had owned from 1989 to 1996 and about a thankyou note from Mr Lawrence which was said to have been given to the appellant when Mr Lawrence ceased employment at the theatre.

270The application was made on two grounds. It was the appellant's case at the trial that when Mr Lawrence ceased employment at the theatre he left a thankyou note for the appellant. At the first trial Mr Tenant said he did not remember such a note, whereas at the trial in question he said that he did recall it.

271The second matter which formed the basis of the application related to a truck which according to the evidence of KM was used for taking rubbish to the tip. Inquiries had revealed that the vehicle was owned by Mr Tenant from 1989 to 1996 and thereafter by the appellant until 11 May 2012 when it was transferred to Mr Tenant. The Crown indicated that it wished to question Mr Tenant in relation to the acquisition of that truck and the evidence he gave in the proceedings.

272Mr Tenant was cross-examined on the voir dire. Thereafter the following exchange took place between the trial judge and counsel:

""HIS HONOUR: The truck is in fact something that's been dealt with in the trials. It's a fact relevant to a fact in issue in the trial in relation to one of the charges involving [KM]. And the question of what it was like is relevant. On the answers given here I don't see how I can let you cross-examine him about it; you may want to ask about the truck because it was mentioned and get what he has to say about it but I don't think you're entitled to cross-examine him Madam Crown because he simply denies any impropriety. It's a fact that he received it and he doesn't dispute that and he can explain that; it is a matter in issue in the trial is the question of the Ute, whether the Ute was used in relation to the rubbish removal. There was a - whether or not it was a truck. [TM] says she sees a Ute, a pale vehicle which she doesn't, presumably mix up with a truck with a cage on it; so I know that all those things are in issue in the trial. I've a mind to let you get the supplementary evidence about the fact that he owned the truck and it was in Mr Doyle's name and that it was later transferred to him but none of that is really contrary to the evidence that he's given in the case; so unless it's inconsistent you're not entitled to cross-examine on it but you are entitled to get it out as evidence-in-chief.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It could still be motive to lie your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well you're entitled to put to the jury at the end of the trial that you rely on some witnesses and not on others, of course it depends what the accused says presuming he gives evidence. I'm not going to make any ruling about motive to lie at this stage on the material in the Basha Inquiry or the voir dire, call it whichever, you may not cross-examine the witness on that material but you may get it out as supplementary evidence.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour I'd also like to cross-examine on the note evidence.

HIS HONOUR: You can cross-examine on that and no doubt he'll give the same evidence he has. But you can certainly cross-examine on that; you've covered the sauna haven't you?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I have covered the sauna your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: And the fridge?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes I did your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Well you're entitled to put to the jury at the end of the trial, no doubt as you will, that they should accept one version rather than another. But in terms of credibility - what's that section, 102 is it, about credibility?

TERRACINI: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It's got to have substantial-

TERRACINI: Probative value.

HIS HONOUR: -now you might be suspicious but the fact is that he gives what appears to be a plausible explanation about that, that he's got plastic Guide Dogs in the back of the truck. No doubt Mr Terracini is salivating at the prospect of being able to mention Guide Dogs for the blind in his address to the jury, but it doesn't seem to me to be such to have such weight that it represents a basis for an attack on the credibility of a witness at this stage. I don't know what the evidence will show later on but you can cross-examine him about the note in front of the jury and you can get from him the registration history so to speak of the vehicle because it does have some bearing on at least one of the issues - one of the charges in the trial; very well we'll have the jury.

TERRACINI: Your Honour I should be permitted then to cross-examine about the innocuous nature of the truck because if my friend, and this may require a ruling from your Honour before Mr Tenant's leave, because if my friend's going to say it's a motive to lie and I've got grave feelings of disquiet about that approach because he's given categorical denials in the absence of the jury and we're entitled to those denials if she's going to say that he's got a motive to lie knowing what's been heard in the absence of the jury. The fellow's got to have some opportunity by indirectly to stand up for himself.

HIS HONOUR: Well if the evidence is being called as supplementary evidence, which it is, you can cross-examine on it.

TERRACINI: Thank you.

HIS HONOUR: Right. We'll have the jury. It's a matter for you Madam Crown how far you take that whether you want to raise that matter but you can certainly get the history if you wish to.""(07/06/2012 pp 526-528)

273The Crown Prosecutor then asked Mr Tenant questions directed toward the inconsistent statements concerning the note. Thereafter she asked the following questions:

""Q. So your contact with Philip Doyle was certainly beyond telephone conversations discussing his state of health?A. I did that as well.

Q. Did you also meet him for some meals on occasions?A. I saw him not for meals, I saw him at Ramsgate RSL for a drink once and the Panorama Room at Bulli for a drink once.

Q. Were they prearranged or did you just happen to be there and you happened to see him?
A. No they were prearranged.

Q. And were both of those after September 2011 when you gave evidence in this matter last year?A. Yes.

Q. In relation to the receipt of that truck from Mr Doyle-A. Yes.

Q. -has that had any influence on the evidence you've given?A. None whatsoever.

Q. The friendship that you've maintained with Mr Doyle-A. I wouldn't really call it a friendship like he's never been to my place, my wife has never even met him.

Q. You've certainly been to his place though apart from the truck?A. Yeah once - one other time.

Q. Was that the weekend before you gave evidence in September 2001?A. I don't recall what weekend it was sorry.

Q. Your Honour I am referring to page 285 from the 15 September.

HIS HONOUR: That is last year is it?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is your Honour.

Q. I suggest that you were asked these questions on the 15 September, 'When was the last time you saw him apart from these court proceedings' and your answer was 'Last weekend'. Do you agree that you gave that evidence on the 15 September last year?A. If that's what it says yes.

Q. You were asked 'When you saw him last weekend, 'Was there anybody else present' and your answer '[MB]'.A. Okay.

Q. Do you recall seeing Philip Doyle on that occasion with [MB]?A. I don't know the dates sorry. I can't remember a weekend - which weekend it was or where it was.

Q. Well within days of giving evidence in the proceedings last time you had been in the company of Philip Doyle and [MB], does that accord with your memory?A. If I said that then that's would've happened yeah.

Q. And in the months leading up to September 2011, did you spend other time with the accused Philip Doyle?A. Possibly.

Q. You were asked on the 15 of September 2011, 'Are you able to say how many occasions' and your response 'I don't know exactly. Half a dozen, ten, maybe ten'.A. Okay.

Q. Do you agree that's the evidence you gave in September of last year?A. Yes.

Q. So in relation to Philip Doyle do you say that you don't really have a friendship with him?A. Not really.

Q. Well what was the purpose of seeing him on those half dozen maybe ten occasions?A. Mainly about his health, how he has been affected.

Q. Mr Tenant have you had any discussions with anybody about the evidence that you gave in September 2011?A. Not really no.

Q. Have you spoken to anybody about the evidence that you gave about the sauna at Ozone Street Cronulla?A. No.

Q. Are you certain of that?A. Yes. I think so.

Q. This morning did you say it was impossible that you had had discussions with somebody about the Ozone Street Sauna?A. I may have mentioned to my wife in discussions with her but nothing else.

Q. In relation to your concern for Philip Doyle's health has that had any influence on the evidence that you have given in these proceedings in front of this jury?A. No.

Q. Nothing further.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Terracini.

TERRACINI: Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR: Sorry.

Q. The work that you are doing now-A. Yes.

Q. -does that include work as a consultant for Guide Dogs Australia?A. Yes.

Q. Is that paid employment with Guide Dogs Australia?A. You get a fee yes.

Q. And does part of your fee relating to transporting the plastic guide dog money box donation things?A. Yes.

Q. So you are paid in relation to transporting those plastic guide dog money box things?A. Yes I get a fee.

Q. And does your fee relate to how often or how many of those you deal with?A. Yes.

Q. The truck that you're now in possession of that you were given by Philip Doyle, is it your intention to use that truck to transport these plastic guide dog donation boxes?A. Yes that's what it's for.

Q. So you're going to or your intention is to make money from using that truck?A. You just about break even, it's more of a charity than anything. They give you a small fee but by the time you run petrol, accommodation, running around you don't make much money.

Q. Well you're certainly paid a fee and you can claim expenses as part of your tax return, can't you?A. Yes.""(07/06/2012 pp 536-539)

274Senior counsel for the appellant at the trial then cross-examined Mr Tenant to establish that the truck was of very little value, worth about $400, and had not been used for transporting life size Guide Dog Australia donation boxes. Mr Tenant also denied receiving money from the appellant.

275In her address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor made the following remarks:

""Robert Tenant was the manager from the time when Mark Lawrence started at the Kogarah Mecca and he said that Mark Lawrence came back and asked for a job at the cinema for his brother after he'd left the cinema. Mark Lawrence denied that that happened. Robert Te",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763286,R v McKellar (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 107,"Judgment
1On Monday 17 February 2014, the special hearing of three serious allegations made by the Crown against Shane Thomas McKellar (to whom I shall refer in these reasons for verdict as ""the accused"") commenced in the Supreme Court at Bathurst.  Before that occurred, I had satisfied myself that the necessary preconditions contained in the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act 1990 (NSW) for such a hearing being conducted had been fulfilled.  I shall refer to that legislation as ""the Act"", and references to sections will be to those of the Act unless otherwise indicated.
2The special hearing was conducted by me as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings: s 21(1).  The accused was represented by senior counsel throughout the special hearing, in accordance with s 21(2).  The special hearing was conducted in such a way that it was intelligible to any interested observer: R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505; 54 NSWLR 1.  No election for the proceedings to be conducted before a jury having been made by either party, the special hearing proceeded before me sitting as a judge alone: s 21A.
3A short time after the special hearing commenced, the accused voluntarily absented himself.  After hearing submissions, I permitted the special hearing to continue in his absence, and have delivered a separate judgement in that regard: R v McKellar (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 105.
Indictment
4At the commencement of the hearing, an indictment containing three counts was presented.  The third count, including a statutory alternative that was relied upon by the Crown, was the subject of a verdict by direction by me at the end of the Crown case.  Again, that is the subject of a separate judgement: R v McKellar (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 106.  In the circumstances, there is no need for me to discuss that count further, although the evidence that was said to found that count remains before me and may require consideration.
5The remaining two counts were as follows.  Count one alleged that, contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the accused had, on 21 May 2011 at Bourke, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, robbed Bruce Wentworth Delany of the sum of $50, and immediately after doing so had inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the same person.  For reasons that will become apparent, it is important to record that that offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.
6Count two alleged that, contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act, on 23 May 2011 and in the same township, the accused murdered the same gentleman (to whom I shall refer throughout these reasons as ""the deceased"").
Fundamental legal principles
7I turn to discuss some fundamental principles applicable to the special hearing.
8It is incumbent upon me to return verdicts with regard to those two remaining counts.  I am also required, not only by way of the common law with regard to criminal proceedings conducted before a judge alone (see Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250) but also by way of s 21B(2), to set out the principles of law that I have applied, the findings of fact that I have made, and the process of the application of the law to those facts that underpin my verdicts.
9It is convenient at this stage to state three basic legal principles that I have borne firmly in mind in coming to my verdicts.
10The first is that the Crown bears the onus of proof.  The accused need prove nothing.  It is not a matter of the accused needing to establish his innocence; to the contrary, it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove his guilt.  
11The second principle is that the Crown is required to do so beyond reasonable doubt.  Proof to any lesser standard is insufficient.  Suspicion, even the gravest suspicion, cannot, of course, be equated with proof beyond reasonable doubt.
12The third and final basic proposition is that it is not incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt every fact upon which it relies.  Rather, it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove the essential elements of the two offences before me.  It is convenient to set them out now.
Elements of the offences
13As for count one, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that, on 21 May 2011, whilst armed with an offensive weapon, the accused robbed the deceased and immediately afterwards inflicted grievous bodily harm upon him.  And the Crown must prove that, in doing so, the accused acted voluntarily. 
14Analysing those elements in more depth for a moment, an offensive weapon is defined in s 4 of the Crimes Act as including ""anything that is made or adapted for offensive purposes"" or ""anything that, in the circumstances, is used, intended for use or threatened to be used for offensive purposes, whether or not it is ordinarily used for offensive purposes or is capable of causing harm"".
15Robbery may be defined as the stealing of property from the person of the victim or his or her immediate vicinity accompanied by the use of violence or the threat of violence.  
16Stealing may be defined as the taking away of property of another person, without the consent of that person, with a dishonest state of mind, and with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of his or her property.
17Inflicting grievous bodily harm may be equated with causing really serious physical injury.
18It is not the case that it is an element of count one that the accused intended that grievous bodily harm would result: Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205.
19Turning to the elements of count two, the Crown case had two bases.  The first basis was what I call intentional murder, and the second was what I call constructive murder (also sometimes known as felony murder).
20The elements of the first basis of the Crown case for murder are that the accused; voluntarily; did an act; that caused the death of the deceased; and, at the time of doing that act; the accused intended: either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.
21The elements of the second basis of the Crown case for murder are that the accused; voluntarily; did an act; that caused the death of the deceased; during or immediately after; the commission by the accused of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or 25 years.
22The Crown submitted that count one, in light of the applicable maximum penalty to which I have referred, is able (if established beyond reasonable doubt) to fulfil the role of the foundational offence for constructive murder.
23With regard to constructive murder, I approach the matter on the basis that the act causing death need not be an ""extra"" act above and beyond the elements of the foundational offence.
24It can be seen with regard to count one and the two bases of count two that voluntariness is an essential element of each offence: see, with regard to constructive murder Penza and Di Maria v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 21.  I approach the requirement of voluntariness as being of a willed movement of the muscles on the part of the accused, as opposed to, for example, a reflex action.
25I shall return to discuss some further legal principles shortly.  At this stage of my reasons it is convenient to set out all of the evidence presented in the trial in general chronological form.  None of the evidence was the subject of dispute by senior counsel for the accused, whether by way of cross-examination, or by calling of witnesses to the contrary, or by way of submissions.
Chronological background of undisputed facts
26The deceased was born on 31 January 1930.  Accordingly, on Saturday, 21 May 2011 he was aged 81 years.  He resided at premises at 16 Becker Street, Bourke.  His neighbour to the north was Ms Annette Wilson at 18 Becker Street.  His neighbour to the south was Ms Karlene Potter at 16 Becker Street.  To her south at 12 Becker Street lived Ms Patricia Grimes.  On the other side of the road was 11A Becker Street. 
27Between 2005 and 2009, the deceased was treated for various health issues.  These included significant problems with regard to his heart, including the replacement of a valve.  He also had a cancerous tumour successfully removed from his bowel.  Dr Grassby, a surgeon, treated him with regard to the latter condition.
28In December 2010, the accused, an Aboriginal man then aged 32 years, met a young lady by the name of Ms Belita Wilson.  The two of them were in the habit of spending time at the home of her aunt, Ms Annette Wilson, who, as I have said, lived next door to the deceased.  During that month, the accused mentioned that he wished to break into the home of the deceased.  Belita Wilson dissuaded him from doing so.
29Throughout the weeks leading up to 21 May 2011, the accused and Belita Wilson stayed at 18 Becker Street for a number of nights.  They left their clothes there in a blue striped plastic bag.
30At 6:30 PM on Friday, 20 May 2011, Karlene Potter finished work.  At about 7 PM she visited the deceased at his home, and found nothing out of the ordinary.  Meanwhile at about 7 PM Ms Gloria Wilson, the mother of Belita Wilson, hosted a barbecue at her home at 1 Hamilton Place, Bourke.  The accused and Belita Wilson attended that barbecue before sunset.  At that time, the accused was wearing a green hooded jumper, green and gold shorts, and a yellow cap.
31On the same evening, Mr Warren Edwards attended a barbecue at 5 Harris Street, the home of his aunt Ms Gail Edwards.  It seems that the accused visited that barbecue at some point, but stayed for only 10 to 15 minutes.
32At around 8 PM, Annette Wilson, who had been out for a drink, returned to her home at 18 Becker Street.  Karlene Potter returned to her home at 14 Becker Street at 8:15 PM.  At 9 PM Annette Wilson went to sleep.
33At 10 PM, Mr Victor Azzopardi arrived at his daughter's home in Darling Street, Bourke, and there decided that he and his son Mr Jimmy Smith would go hunting.  They proceeded to do so.
34Gail Edwards went to bed at around midnight.  When she did so, the accused and Belita Wilson were still at her home.
35At some stage before 1 AM on Saturday 21 May 2011, Annette Wilson was woken by Belita Wilson and the accused, who had come to her house wanting to retrieve their bags.  They stayed for 15 minutes, and then left.  Annette Wilson locked the door behind them.  In the event, they did not take their bags with them.
36In the early hours of the morning of 21 May 2011, the accused and Belita Wilson went walking all over town.  They were searching for prohibited drugs that they could purchase and use.  Belita Wilson bought some drugs.  According to her, the accused possessed no money. 
37At about 4 AM, Victor Azzopardi returned from his hunting trip to the home of his daughter in Darling Street.  There he saw Belita Wilson and the accused.  The accused had a lighter, a spoon, and syringes.  In the presence of Victor Azzopardi, the accused injected Belita Wilson with some form of drug.  According to Belita Wilson, the accused also used drugs intravenously, perhaps a morphine tablet that had been crushed and dissolved.  Victor Azzopardi formed the opinion that the accused was affected by a prohibited drug, because he was talking a great deal and not making sense.
38According to Victor Azzopardi, Belita Wilson left the premises at Darling Street, and she was followed later by the accused.  
39According to Belita Wilson, she and the accused parted at around sunrise at the corner of Short Street and Tarcoon Street, Bourke.  When Belita Wilson last saw the accused, he was heading up a laneway towards Becker Street.  At the time, the accused was wearing a green hooded jumper with a black print on the front and grey tracksuit pants.  The two had arranged to meet later that day at the home of the mother of Belita Wilson.
40At 6 AM, Karlene Potter awoke and made herself a coffee.  At about 6:30 AM, Karlene Potter saw the deceased let her dog out of her yard, which was in accordance with his usual practice.  The deceased was wearing navy blue or black track pants, a vest, and a cardigan.
41Meanwhile, back at her home at 1 Hamilton Place, Gloria Wilson woke up and assumed that Belita Wilson and the accused had left.
42At some indeterminate time that morning, Annette Wilson left 18 Becker Street and went to visit Gloria Wilson at 1 Hamilton Place.
43Again at an indeterminate time, a young boy to whom it is convenient to refer as CO woke up at the home of his grandmother at 90 Darling Street, had breakfast, kicked a ball around, and had a shower.
44At about 9:25 AM, Karlene Potter saw the deceased return her dog to her yard.  Very shortly after that, Karlene Potter noticed her dog barking and trying to jump the fence.  Karlene Potter became concerned about the welfare of the deceased. 
45The deceased made his way from his home at 16 Becker Street to the home of Karlene Potter at 14 Becker Street.  Whilst at the front door he yelled out to her ""[O]pen the door"".  When she did so, Karlene Potter saw the deceased with his back to her, leaning on the railing, holding his stomach with one hand.
46The deceased said ""He's in there, he's in there.  He said he was going to kill me"".  Karlene Potter asked ""Who?""  The deceased replied, ""The bloke, he's in there"".  Karlene Potter moved as if to go over to 16 Becker Street, and the deceased said ""No, no, come back, he's still in there.  He stabbed me.  I gave him $50 and the bloke said 'I don't care, I am still going to kill you.'  He had a knife, it was that big."" The deceased used his hands to indicate a distance of approximately 13 inches.  The deceased then said ""It was a skinny knife and had a pointy blade.  I was pulling his hair.  Ring the ambulance"".
47Karlene Potter called the police station at Bourke and requested the urgent attendance of police and ambulance.  She did what she could to assist the deceased and make him comfortable.  She also called out to her neighbour Patricia Grimes ""Pussy, someone broke in and stabbed Rooster and they're still in his house."" 
48Patricia Grimes and her daughter came over and assisted Karlene Potter with the treatment of the deceased.  Patricia Grimes heard the deceased say ""Someone broke into my house and stabbed me and he's still there.  He's got a knife and a golf stick"".  
49A little later, Karlene Potter asked the deceased ""Who was in there?"" and the deceased replied ""He had long hair, dark sunglasses on, late 20s and thin framed"".
50Meanwhile CO was walking down the street with some friends.  They were kicking a ball around on the way to the park.  CO saw a man on the ""other side of the fence"" between 16 and 18 Becker Street; that is, in the backyard of 18 Becker Street.  He observed that the man had long hair and was wearing a blue and yellow hat.
51At around the same time, a young boy to whom it is convenient to refer as DJ was standing in the driveway of 11A Becker Street (virtually opposite 16 Becker Street), and saw a man jump the fence.  According to DJ, that man was wearing black clothes, a blue and yellow hat, black gloves and running shoes, and was holding a ""pointy"" knife and a golf stick.  The man said to DJ ""Don't look"".
52The young boy CO saw a number of women attending to the deceased on the front balcony of 14 Becker Street.  CO overheard one of the women say that the assailant had possessed ""a knife and a golf stick"".
53At about 9:30 AM, the accused came through the back door of 5 Harris Street, Bourke.  He was panting as if he had been running, and seemed to be nervous.  He was seen by Gail Edwards.  She asked him ""What the fuck is you coming in here for, are you running from the police?""  He replied in the affirmative.  The accused at that stage was wearing a shirt, track pants, and a grey zip-up hooded jumper.
54At the same premises, Warren Edwards awoke to find the accused standing by his bed.  The accused said to Warren Edwards ""Run me down here"".  When Warren Edwards declined and said that he had no petrol, the accused said ""Yeah I got money for petrol"", and thereafter Warren Edwards agreed.  According to Warren Edwards, the accused was agitated and was wearing black trousers and a black top and a hat or beanie.  The accused and Warren Edwards got into the motor vehicle of Warren Edwards.
55Warren Edwards drove the accused and another man up Harris Street.  The accused requested that Warren Edwards take an alternative route.  Eventually, Warren Edwards dropped the accused off at the home of Ms Alison Smith.
56At about 9:40 AM, uniformed police attended 14 Becker Street.  They immediately assisted in the care of the deceased.  The police entered 16 Becker Street and found that no one was present.  They did note that some drawers were opened and a yellow handled screwdriver was lying on the floor.  
57Meanwhile ambulance officers had arrived and were attending to the deceased at 14 Becker Street.  In the presence of Mr Kern, the ambulance officer, the deceased was asked who had stabbed him, and he replied ""It was an Aboriginal male in his 20s with long hair and dark glasses.  I don't know who he was.""
58Whilst he was being wheeled to the ambulance, Patricia Grimes heard the deceased say ""He's Aboriginal, he's twentyish, he's got long hair because I grabbed him by the hair and got a handful.""
59The deceased was transported to Bourke District Hospital by way of ambulance and passed into the care of Dr Robb.  Thereafter enquiries were made about his urgent transfer to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney or Dubbo Base Hospital.  The medical condition of the deceased fluctuated.
60At about 10 AM, uniformed police were seeking to enter 18 Becker Street, as against the possibility that the person who had stabbed the deceased was present in those premises.  A uniformed police officer went to the rear of 18 Becker Street and found the door was locked, contrary to the expectation of Annette Wilson.  Annette Wilson told that officer that there should be no one in her home.
61Two uniformed police entered the house, and immediately saw a golf club and a plastic mask with long hair attached to it in the lounge room. They also saw that the manhole cover was open in the laundry.
62At Bourke District Hospital, Dr Robb examined the deceased.  He noted that the deceased had a laceration in the vicinity of his right ear, an injury to his left ear, a small wound to the lower part of his breastbone, and three wounds to his abdomen that featured dried and oozing blood.  There were no wounds to the back of the deceased.  The deceased denied that he had been hit with any implement such as a golf club, and no injuries were observed to his head or scalp.
63At 10:20 AM, two more police officers entered 18 Becker Street.  They observed that the kitchen window on the north side of the home was open.
64At 11:30 AM, Senior Constable Campbell spoke with the deceased in the emergency department of Bourke Hospital.  The deceased told Senior Constable Campbell that a man followed him inside his house through the back door and asked him for money.  The deceased said that ""He would be in his twenties, reasonably thin build and long hair, he had a golf club and a knife"".  The deceased gave him $50 but ""he wanted more, and then he told me he [was] going to kill me, and then he started to stab me"".  The deceased also said that while they ""wrestled about"" he had grabbed a handful of the assailant's hair, and that after he ran next door the assailant stayed in the house. 
65At 3:15 PM, the deceased arrived by way of the Royal Flying Doctor Service at Dubbo Base Hospital.  He was immediately transferred into the care of Dr Grassby and taken to the operating theatre.
66At 3:30 PM, Detective Senior Constable Kremers, a crime scene officer, attended the premises of 14, 16, and 18 Becker Street.  He took a large number of photographs and prepared captions for them.
67With regard to 16 Becker Street, he saw in the dining room a large number of red stains that tested positive to presumptive tests for blood.  He observed a large hole in the gyprock wall, with pieces of gyprock on the floor, suggestive of it having been recently created.  He saw and collected a number of hair fibres from the floor.  He saw that the drawers of a side table were open and their contents disturbed.  He saw what he believed to be passive drops of blood on the chest freezer.  He observed that a chair was upturned on the floor.  He saw a metal bracket, with one end wrapped in blue material.  He could not locate any fingerprints of significance in the premises.
68He examined the bedrooms of the home. In the master bedroom he saw that the wardrobe doors and drawers had been opened.  He also saw an open packet of screwdrivers on the floor.  In the laundry, he located a length of rope and a golf club at the entrance to the rear yard.  At the end of a ramp leading from the rear doorway into the backyard, he located a small pair of scissors, the handles of which were wrapped in blue material that was very similar to the material in which the bracket had been wrapped.  He also located a $50 note at the bottom of the ramp.
69Detective Senior Constable Kremers took various samples from 16 Becker Street, and made various markings.
70At 14 Becker Street, he observed a number of bloodstains on the concrete path leading to the front door.  He also located a jacket of the deceased in that location. He did not enter those premises.
71In the rear yard of 18 Becker Street, Detective Senior Constable Kremers located three bags of clothes.  Wrapped up under the house were sundry items of clothing and two mobile phones.  Also located under the house were four pieces of blue coloured material that were very similar to the material that was around the bracket and the handles of the scissors located at 16 Becker Street.
72In the lounge room of 18 Becker Street, Detective Senior Constable Kremers located a latex mask with long hair attached to it on the lounge.  He also located a golf club behind the lounge chair that had red stains on its shaft and a white, chalky substance on its head.  
73In bedroom three Detective Senior Constable Kremers located a hole in the gyprock that created a cavity.  Located in the wall cavity were some used syringes and spoons, and a large double-bladed knife wrapped in a red and white tea towel.  Another golf club was also found in bedroom three.
74In the laundry, the crime scene officer observed that tiles had been removed from the wall above the sink, leaving a cavity that exposed the rear of the taps.
75The officer took a number of items from 18 Becker Street and left the premises.
76At about 5:50 PM, the deceased was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at Dubbo Base Hospital, his surgery having been completed. He remained intubated, paralysed and ventilated, and his condition appeared stable.
77Some time later in the day, the accused asked Victor Azzopardi to drive him from Bourke to Narromine, a not inconsiderable distance.  He agreed to do so.  Victor Azzopardi dropped Jimmy Smith and the accused off at a stock yard whilst he went to purchase petrol, using $100 cash that he had been given by the accused.  When Victor Azzopardi returned to pick up the accused and Mr Smith, the accused said ""Let's get out of here quick"".
78Whilst the three men were driving towards Nyngan, the accused said ""I stole all the money and I stabbed the old man, I'm in big shit.""  Victor Azzopardi asked ""How many times did you stab him?"" to which the accused replied ""Will you go witness for me, tell them I didn't do it?""  Victor Azzopardi replied in the affirmative in an attempt to pacify the accused.  Throughout the drive the accused repeatedly spoke about the fact that he had ""stabbed the man and taken the money"", asked Jimmy Smith and Victor Azzopardi to ""go witness"" for him and ""tell them I didn't do it"", and encouraged Victor Azzopardi to drive faster as he wanted to ""get away"".
79By 11:38 PM, the vehicle driven by Victor Azzopardi with his two passengers had arrived in Narromine.  It was observed by uniformed police, who stopped it for a random breath test.  The police observed that the accused, who was sitting in the back seat, was moving around as if trying to conceal an object.  When the police sought to stop the car, the accused said to Victor Azzopardi ""Go Vic put your foot down"".
80When the police approached the car and spoke to the occupants, the accused gave a false name.  It was found that the person whose name the accused had given had breached a bail curfew, and as a result the accused was arrested and taken to Narromine Police Station.  At that location the accused was found to have a very large amount of cash in his wallet.  In due course the accused gave the police his correct name, and his identity was confirmed as Shane Thomas McKellar.
81In the early hours of Sunday 22 May 2011, the police officer who had arrested the accused was informed that he should be detained with regard to an allegation of a serious assault.  Meanwhile the money located in the possession of the accused was counted at Narromine Police Station and found to total $6057.80.
82To be clear, the learned Crown Prosecutor at the commencement of the special hearing explicitly disavowed any submission that that sum had been the subject matter of the robbery of the deceased or a stealing from 16 Becker Street. 
83At 2:15 AM detectives arrived from Dubbo.  A detective noticed a bruise above the left eye of the accused.  It was decided that the accused was intoxicated by some substance and should not be interviewed at that stage.
84At 4:28 AM, the accused engaged in a recorded interview.  He told the police that he had spent the night of Friday 20 May 2011 at his uncle's farm just outside of Bourke.  He also told them that on the Saturday morning he had gone fishing close to the property of his uncle, and spent some time gardening there before walking to the home of Victor Azzopardi just before 4 PM so that he, Victor Azzopardi and Jimmy Smith could drive to Orange to assist the sister of the accused to move her belongings back to Bourke.  The accused told police that he did not see or speak to anyone, and was not seen by anyone, on the Friday night or on the Saturday before he left to meet Victor Azzopardi.
85At 5:51 AM that interview concluded.  At the end of the interview, a detective noted what appeared to him to be red stains on the shoes being worn by the accused. The accused claimed that the stains were actually ""egg"".
86At about 4 AM on Monday, 23 May 2011, the blood pressure of the deceased collapsed without warning.  It was determined that that was probably the result of sepsis or a serious heart problem.  Dr Grassby spoke with the family of the deceased and it was agreed that there should be no further surgical intervention.  Tragically, at 9:05 AM on Monday, 23 May 2011, the deceased passed away.
87Subsequently, the police conducted further investigations, including examination of items seized from various premises at Becker Street. Police also returned to the premises at 18 Becker Street.  Further items, including a green hooded jacket from bedroom two, and blue material from under the house, were taken back to Bourke Police Station.
88On Tuesday, 24 May, Annette Wilson returned to her home at 18 Becker Street and went through it room by room with two detectives.  She noticed that a number of electrical items were missing from her home.  She was also shown a photograph of the knife that had been previously seized from the wall cavity with a tea towel wrapped around its handle, and she identified the tea towel as belonging to her.  On the same occasion, police located in the wall cavity behind the taps in the laundry a pair of canvas gloves that featured a large number of red stains to their exterior.
89On Wednesday, 25 May 2011, the autopsy with regard to the body of the deceased was conducted by Dr Cala.  Dr Cala provides in his autopsy report details of the wounds that I have already described, along with wounds on the left index finger and right elbow of the deceased that Dr Cala considered could have been ""defence-type"" injuries.
90Dr Cala, whilst noting that the deceased (as one might expect in light of his age) had a number of health issues, found that, other than the injuries to which I have referred, the body of the deceased was generally unremarkable.
91Dr Cala also expressed the opinion that there was no deficiency in the medical treatment of the deceased.  
92Dr Cala expressed the opinion that the direct cause of the death of the deceased was multiple stab wounds.  He noted that the three wounds to the abdomen were between 17mm and 20mm wide.  He also expressed the opinion that the most serious of the wounds had a depth of approximately 12 cm.
93Finally, he expressed the opinion that the knife seized from 18 Becker Street could have inflicted the injuries to the body of the deceased.
94On the morning of 1 June 2011, the accused was taken from Bathurst Gaol to Bathurst Police Station for the purpose of an interview.  There he was spoken to by a detective and said ""I hadn't even got to Narromine yet and people were ringing and causing trouble for me.  I don't even know what you are talking about"".  Thereafter, on legal advice, the accused exercised his right to silence.  Although the accused did not consent to various forensics samples been taken, eventually a buccal swab and hair samples were taken from him.
95On 27 October 2011, a certificate was prepared with regard to the results of DNA testing of a large number of items seized from various premises at Becker Street, a sample from the deceased, and the sample from the accused.  
96To state those results with great succinctness, the latex mask found in 18 Becker Street had bloodstains at two locations that were statistically extremely likely to have come from the deceased.
97The blades of the scissors found at the back of 16 Becker Street possessed DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused.  So did the blue material wrapped around the right handle of the scissors.
98The left shoe of the accused was found to have a stain that was positive to a presumptive test for blood.  That stain contained DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused and the deceased. 
99The right shoe of the deceased had a stain that was positive to a presumptive test for blood, and was found to be statistically extremely likely to contain DNA that came from the deceased.
100A swab from the golf club handle located in the lounge room in 18 Becker Street contained DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the deceased and the accused.  The stain on the shaft of the same club reacted positively to a screening test for blood and was statistically extremely likely to contain DNA from the deceased.
101All of the hair located at 16 Becker Street was statistically extremely likely to have come from the head of the accused.
102Blood drops located at the front of 16 Becker Street were statistically extremely likely to have come from the deceased.
103As for the pair of gloves located in the wall cavity in the laundry of 18 Becker Street, the left glove on its inside cuff revealed DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused.  A stain on the outside of that item reacted positively to a screening test for blood, and contained DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the deceased.  
104As for the right glove, the inside cuff of that item contained DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused.  A stain on the outside of the back of that item reacted positively to a screening test for blood, and was statistically extremely likely to have included DNA from the deceased.
105The green hooded jumper that was located in a bedroom inside 18 Becker Street, and which, according to the evidence of Belita Wilson in the witness box, was the jumper that she had seen the accused wearing in the early hours of Saturday, 21 May 2011, was found to have DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused on its inside left cuff and on the interior of the back of the neck.  It was also found to have two stains, each of which reacted positively to a presumptive test for blood, and each of which was statistically extremely likely to contain DNA from the deceased.
106As for the tea towel that had been wrapped around the knife that was secreted in 18 Becker Street, it was found to have DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused.
107As for the knife itself, its handle was found to contain DNA that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the accused.  Two stains that were located on the blade of that knife each contained DNA material that was statistically extremely likely to have come from the deceased.
108That completes my chronological review of the evidence.  It is convenient now to turn to the submissions of the parties.  
Submissions
109It is worth noting immediately that senior counsel for the accused did not submit that I should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the offences averred in count one and count two.  However, with regard to the count of murder, she submitted that I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused possessed an intention to kill or inflict really serious physical injury.  Rather, she submitted that I should be satisfied that murder had been proven by way of the doctrine of constructive murder.  I shall return to that submission later.
110The Crown Prosecutor commenced his address by reminding me of the four verdicts that are available in a special hearing; namely, not guilty; the special verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness; that on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged; and finally that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an available alternative offence with regard to the offence charged: s 22(1).  
111He submitted that there was no evidence in the trial that could found a special verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness.  He also disavowed any reliance upon an alternative verdict with regard to either count.  In particular, he submitted that an alternative verdict of manslaughter had no role to play with regard to count two.
112He submitted that, even if I were to confine myself only to the evidence of what the deceased said to a number of persons before he died, I would be satisfied to the criminal standard that the deceased had been robbed of $50 by way of the presentation of a knife, and that that $50 had been taken from the inside of the home to the backyard.  He also submitted that I would accept without difficulty that it was the robber who inflicted the wounds to the body of the deceased, and that those wounds constitute grievous bodily harm.
113With regard to count two, he submitted that I would have no difficulty in finding that the act of stabbing the deceased caused his death, founded upon all of the medical evidence to which I have referred, and in particular the opinion of Dr Cala.  
114The Crown Prosecutor also submitted that a large number of factors would lead me to the view that the assailant possessed one or other of the necessary intentions for murder.
115First, the words that were uttered to the deceased.  
116Secondly, the fact that those words were said whilst the assailant was armed with a knife.  
117Thirdly, the fact that the weapon was capable of inflicting death without difficulty, in light of the length of its blade, the fact that it was double-edged, and the fact that it was pointed.  
118Fourthly, the number, location, and depth of the wounds, and in particular the location of the three major wounds, in that they were all to the abdomen, a well-known location of vital organs.   
119Fifthly and finally, the fact that the victim was an elderly man.  
120In short, founded upon the total number of injuries; the fact that there were four stabbings to the torso of the deceased, three of which entered his body to a substantial degree; and the fact that one of those wounds penetrated the body of the deceased to a depth of at least 10 cm; combined with the expressed intention of the assailant to kill the deceased, he submitted that I would have no difficulty in inferring that the assailant possessed, at the very least, an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
121He submitted that, if I were to come to that view, there would be no need for me to undertake an analysis of the alternative basis of the Crown case.
122The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the real issue in the special hearing is whether it was the accused who robbed, stabbed, and murdered the deceased.
123In that regard he submitted that the overwhelming inference is that the knife found secreted in 18 Becker Street was the murder weapon.  It is highly significant that on its handle was, he submitted, the DNA of the accused, and on its blade a stain that I would safely infer was the blood of the deceased.
124He accepted that there was no evidence whereby, for example, the deceased directly identified his assailant as the accused, or some eyewitness who had seen the accused stabbing the deceased did so.  He explained that the Crown case that the accused was the assailant really has five bases.
125The first is admissions.  He submitted that the uncontradicted evidence is that, whilst being driven away from Bourke and towards Narromine, the accused repeatedly made admissions that could only be reflective of guilt of this offence.  Furthermore, the accused said things to Gail Edwards that were suggestive that he had committed a serious crime.
126The second is the presence of the accused at the vicinity of the scene of the crime.  The Crown Prosecutor reminded me of the evidence of Belita Wilson that, when she last saw him sometime after dawn on Saturday, 21 May 2011, the accused was not far from Becker Street, and was walking in its general direction.
127The third basis of the Crown case is the scientific evidence.  He submitted that I would infer without difficulty that the blood of the deceased was on the left shoe and the right shoe worn by the accused when he was arrested.  He submitted that I would also infer without hesitation that the hair located on the floor of the home of the deceased had been pulled from the head of the accused by the deceased whilst they were struggling, just as the deceased said he had done to more than one person before he passed away.  
128He submitted that I would find that the stain on the shaft of the golf club found in the lounge room of 18 Becker Street was the blood of the deceased.  
129He submitted that it is no accident that no relevant fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, because the assailant was wearing gloves.  He reminded me that the young boy DJ, who saw the man jump the fence, described him as wearing gloves, albeit black ones.  He submitted that it was highly significant that those gloves bore a DNA profile identical to that of the accused, and also what I would find to be the blood of the deceased.  
130Finally, the learned Crown Prosecutor took me to the evidence about the green hooded jumper; namely, that Belita Wilson identified it as the item of clothing worn by the accused that morning; that it was located in the premises to which the accused had access and in which he stored his clothing; and that it possessed what I would find to be bloodstains from the body of the deceased.
131The fourth basis is that I would find that the accused had undertaken a number of acts with consciousness of guilt.  He submitted that they included the telling of lies and fleeing from Bourke.  
132He submitted that, when the accused was interviewed, he provided a false alibi when he said that he remained on a farm throughout the entirety of the Friday evening and the Saturday morning.  He submitted that the uncontradicted evidence was that, in truth, the accused was at social events in Bourke on the Friday evening, and roaming the streets of that township early on Saturday morning in search of prohibited drugs.  
133He also submitted that it is clear that the accused took urgent steps to get out of Bourke very soon after the attack had taken place.  
134Finally, he reminded me of the fact that, when the police approached the vehicle in Narromine, they noticed that the accused appeared to be seeking to conceal something, and also at first gave a false name.  
135Whilst he accepted that great caution should be adopted by a tribunal of fact in using acts that are said to be done with a consciousness of guilt, and in particular lies, in support of a Crown case, nevertheless he submitted that I could safely do so in the circumstances of this case.
136The fifth basis of the Crown case was a number of disparate circumstances.  The Crown Prosecutor reminded me that there was evidence that the accused spent a number of nights at 18 Becker Street in the weeks leading up to the date of the offence.  It was in that very home, he submitted, that the mask, the golf club, and the knife that was the murder weapon were located.  
137He submitted that the accused, several months before, had expressed to Belita Wilson an interest in committing an offence at 16 Becker Street.  
138He reminded me that, on the morning, 18 Becker Street was secured, and it was not as if countless people were coming and going from those premises at the crucial time.  
139Finally, he submitted that the evidence of the intravenous drug use of the accused provided a motive for the commission of the offence and by no means derogated from the proposition that the necessary mental elements of the two counts were made out.  Indeed, he submitted that the use of the mask, the gloves, and the wrapping of the handles of the scissors and the knife with material (presumably in an attempt to limit inculpatory scientific evidence) was suggestive of a substantial degree of planning.
140Turning to the submissions of senior counsel for the accused, as I have said, she did not dispute that it would be open to me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of all of the elements of counts one and two.  But she resisted the proposition that, with regard to count two, an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm had been established beyond reasonable doubt.  
141She submitted that it was clear that the wounds were inflicted to the deceased in the course of a struggle.  She based that submission not only on the findings at the home of the deceased, but also upon the things that the deceased himself had said to various persons before he died.  She submitted that, if that were the case, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of either of those intentions on the part of the accused.  In other words, she submitted that it is a reasonable possibility that the wounds, including the fatal wounds, were inflicted to the person of the deceased in an attempt merely to escape, rather than with any settled intention as to the infliction of injury.
Further relevant legal principles
142I turn now to outline the further legal principles that I have applied in my consideration of my verdicts. 
143First, the fact that the accused gave no evidence in the special hearing, called no witnesses, and exercised his right to silence at the Bathurst Police Station on 1 June 2011 has no effect on the fundamental proposition that the Crown must prove each and every essential element of the counts beyond reasonable doubt.  In other words, I have not used the fact that the accused did not give evidence, did not call witnesses, and exercised his right to silence with the police against him in the slightest: Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25; 205 CLR 50; RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; 199 CLR 620.
144Secondly, I have reminded myself that, to the extent that the evidence of the two young boys was given by way of a recorded interview, I should not draw any adverse inference against the accused from that fact.  Nor should I give the evidence any greater or lesser weight simply because it was given by way of that mechanism: Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 306X.
145Thirdly, with regard to expert evidence, it is noteworthy that none of it was disputed.  Still and all, it remained a matter for me to undertake my own analysis and assessment of the expert opinion evidence in my role as the tribunal of fact.
146Fourthly, I record for completeness that neither party submitted that I should give myself a warning (as it were) with regard to the hearsay evidence (chiefly, the things said by the deceased to various persons about what had occurred in his home that morning) and the evidence of admissions by the accused (chiefly, the things alleged to have been said by the accused to Victor Azzopardi) founded upon s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  The mandatory precondition of a request from a party not having been fulfilled, I have not given myself those warnings.
147Fifthly, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that this was not a circumstantial case, at least to the extent that there was direct evidence in that the accused was alleged to have explicitly confessed to having attacked the deceased when he spoke to Victor Azzopardi.  Nevertheless, I considered that, to the extent that this Crown case is founded on a number of pieces of evidence from disparate sources, it was appropriate to remind myself that I do not need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about any particular fact before I take it into account in my assessment of the Crown case as a whole.  Rather, I have considered all of the evidence together and assessed it as a whole, rather than a collection of small parts.  It is the elements of the offence about which I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, not the particular pieces of evidence that are said to demonstrate their proof: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56, 170 CLR 573.
148Sixthly, before I could deliver a verdict of guilty with regard to either count, I must pause to consider whether there is any rational hypothesis consistent with innocence.  It would only be if I could reject the proposition beyond reasonable doubt that there was any such hypothesis that I could return a verdict of guilty.
149Seventhly, as for acts allegedly done in consciousness of guilt, I have reminded myself to approach them with great caution.  In particular, with regard to alleged lies, I would need to find a number of things established.  First, that the accused did indeed say those words.  Secondly, that the statement was objectively untrue.  Thirdly, that it was deliberately untrue.  Fourthly, that it related to a material issue in this special hearing.  Fifthly, that it was told because the accused realised that the truth could reveal his guilt of the particular crimes of armed robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm and resultant murder.  Sixthly and finally, that the statement has been clearly shown to be a lie by other evidence: Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193; R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157 at [56] - [61] of the judgement of Simpson J with whom Howie AJ agreed.
150I have also reminded myself that people can lie for many reasons, not just because they are guilty of a crime, and I reminded myself that a lie told in consciousness of guilt can by no means prove guilt on its own, and that any such conduct simply becomes part of the circumstantial case of the Crown.
151I have adopted an analogous approach to acts other than lies alleged to evidence consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused: R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52.
Determination
152Finally, I turn to the application of the legal principles to which I have referred to the evidence placed before me, leading to my determination and verdicts.
153I respectfully accept the submission that there is no evidence before me in the special hearing that could lead me to return a special verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness with regard to either count. Accordingly, that verdict need not be discussed further. 
154I consider that the evidence is thoroughly overwhelming that it was the accused who robbed the deceased, stabbed him, gravely injured him, and caused his death.
155To my mind, the scientific evidence demonstrates that the items found in 18 Becker Street were the items used to effect the offences in the premises next door.  I readily accept the inference that the DNA profiles consistent with those of the accused and the deceased found on the various items were there not because of some extraordinary statistical coincidence, but rather because DNA material from the accused and the deceased was indeed on those items.
156The scientific evidence is compelling that, at the time of the offence, the green hooded jumper was being worn by the accused, and, at that time, blood of the deceased spattered onto it.  So is the evidence that the knife secreted in 18 Becker Street was used to inflict the injuries upon the deceased, and that it was being wielded by the accused.  And so is the fact that, when arrested a little over 12 hours after the robbery, the accused was wearing shoes that bore the blood of the deceased upon them.
157Turning to other circumstances, I consider it important that, about six months before the commission of the offences, the accused had mentioned to Belita Wilson the possibility of committing an offence at 16 Becker Street.  I also consider it of some significance that the accused was last seen heading in the general direction of the scene of the crime on the morning in question.
158The undisputed admissions made to Victor Azzopardi to my mind admit of no other interpretation than a confession that the accused had robbed and stabbed the deceased on the morning in question.
159As for matters alleged to demonstrate consciousness of guilt, I am not satisfied that the giving of a false name to the police at Narromine provides such evidence.  I adopt the same approach with regard to the movements of the accused in the rear of the vehicle of Victor Azzopardi.  To my mind, it is quite possible that those actions were derived from the possession by the accused of a large amount of cash in highly suspicious circumstances.  And as I have indicated, it is no part of the Crown case that that cash was the fruits of the robbery.  
160Nor do I use the alleged lies about the whereabouts of the accused on the Friday evening and throughout the Saturday as evidence of consciousness of guilt.  That is so for the following reasons. 
161It is the case that there was no cross-examination by senior counsel for the accused of the witnesses who gave evidence to the contrary.  And I accept that, if this had been a criminal trial in which senior counsel for the accused was fully instructed, one may have inferred that that was an implicit concession that the accused had put forward a false alibi.
162But in this special hearing, senior counsel for the accused made it clear that she had no instructions from the accused with regard to the allegation.  It follows that one cannot necessarily infer from the absence of cross-examination of the witnesses who gave evidence that the accused was in Bourke at those times that that proposition is necessarily established.  In other words, there may be a danger in proceeding on the basis that the things said by the accused in his recorded interview about his whereabouts are proven lies for the purpose of consciousness of guilt reasoning.  In short, for abundant caution arising from the nature of these proceedings, I put those matters to one side. 
163I consider it well open to infer, however, that the accused left Bourke hurriedly due to his consciousness of guilt of the robbery of the deceased, and I use that evidence of flight as part of the circumstantial case against him.
164Finally, I accept the evidence that the accused was a penniless intravenous drug user, at least in the early hours of 21 May 2011, and I accept that that state of affairs may well have provided him with a motive to commit a violent assault and robbery in search of money to fund his own use of prohibited drugs.
165In short, founded upon the scientific evidence; the connection between the accused and the premises at which the weapon and other instruments of the crime were located; the admissions of the accused; the flight of the accused; his expressed interest in committing a crime at 16 Becker Street; and his motive for committing a crime founded on obtaining cash, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused robbed the deceased of $50 at knifepoint and carried it from the inside of the home to the backyard.  I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, after the cash was handed over, the accused used a knife to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.  I am satisfied that all of that conduct was the result of voluntary acts on the part of the accused.  It follows that I shall return a verdict with regard to count one that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged.
166As for the count of murder, I readily accept that it was the stab wounds to the person of the deceased that caused his death.  The simple fact is that, although elderly and suffering from various medical conditions, the deceased was alive and well before he was stabbed on the morning of 21 May 2011.  Two days later he was dead.
167As for the intention with which the accused stabbed the deceased, I have reflected on that at some length.  However, founded upon the expression of an intention to kill immediately before the stabbing; the weapon used; the number of injuries to the person of the deceased as a whole; the location of the three serious injuries in the vicinity of vital organs; and most importantly the depth of one of those injuries, I have come to the position of being affirmatively satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of the acts causing death, the accused intended, at the least, to inflict grievous bodily harm upon this 81-year-old man.  I have come to that view even accepting that those injuries may well have been caused in the course of a struggle, and that the accused may have been affected to some degree by prohibited drugs or other substances.
168It follows that I am satisfied of all of the elements of murder founded upon the first basis of the Crown case.  In accordance with the position of the parties, I shall not proceed to analyse, as an ancillary matter, whether I would also have been satisfied of proof of murder by way of the doctrine of constructive murder.
169In short, with regard to the count of murder I shall return a verdict that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged.  
170I shall now deliver my verdicts.
Verdicts
171With regard to count one, namely the allegation that on 21 May 2011 at Bourke in the State of New South Wales, Shane Thomas McKellar, being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a 35 cm knife, robbed Bruce Wentworth Delany of a 50 dollar note in Australian currency, the property of Bruce Wentworth Delany, and that Shane Thomas McKellar immediately after that robbery inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Bruce Wentworth Delany, I return a verdict that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged.
172With regard to count two, namely the allegation that on 23 May 2011 at Bourke in the State of New South Wales, Shane Thomas McKellar did murder Bruce Wentworth Delany, I return a verdict that, on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence charged.

		26 February 2014",2014-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763291,"EL MASRI, Osman v R [2014] NSWCCA 13","Judgment
1BASTEN JA: In this matter the applicant should have leave to appeal but the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by RS Hulme AJ. 
2HIDDEN J:  I agree with RS Hulme AJ.
3RS HULME AJ:  On 19 September 2013 the abovenamed applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Judge Mahony to imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months for an offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm, viz. a .38 calibre revolver, part of the serial number of which was missing.
4The weapon was found in the lounge room of the applicant's home during a search by police on 14 March 2013 from which date the applicant has been in custody.  The pistol was loaded, in working order and hidden, though readily accessible to persons, including children, in the house.  The cartridges within the weapon were the subject of a charge on a Form 1 of possessing ammunition without a licence, which charge was taken into account.
5The offence charged arose pursuant to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 and carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  It was also the subject of a standard non-parole period of 3 years.  The applicant had pleaded guilty at an early stage and the sentence imposed reflected a 25% discount for the plea.
6His Honour accepted that the applicant had been a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club for a number of years prior to 2012, that since then he had been the subject of threats from persons associated with the Club, his house had been the subject of a drive-by shooting in early 2012, his disabled brother had been attacked by Club members and the applicant had acquired the weapon for the protection of himself and family.  His Honour also found that the applicant had been aware of the illegality of possession of the weapon but considered that the threats to him and his family outweighed the illegality.
7The applicant had not reported the drive-by shooting to the police at the time when it occurred because ""if you were to call the police there'd be consequences and greater harm to you than what is already going to happen"". 
8The applicant was aged 39 at the time of sentence.  He completed Year 10 at school and has been in regular employment as an employee and subsequently on his own account.  His business has suffered considerably on account of his incarceration - a fact that his Honour took into account as extra-curial punishment.  He is married and has a good relationship with his wife and has given praiseworthy support to her in connection with her career and other issues.  He also has a good relationship with two children of an earlier marriage.
9Two reports from a Ms Nasr, a psychologist, were also before his Honour. In her first report Ms Nasr recorded that the applicant had reported a history of anxiety symptomatology, initially arising from events in 1997, and subsequently.  Ms Nasr also said that from the time the applicant ""left the Rebels Motorcycle Club he began to endorse psychological problems, triggered by repeated threats to his safety.  His post-traumatic stress symptoms, including ongoing hypervigilance, anxiety, sleep disturbance and related health problems of low mood have impacted his decision making and contributed to his offending behaviour"".  His Honour recorded that:
In the second report ... Ms Nasr responded to four matters that the offender's legal representatives had raised, namely:
1.To clarify if the offender met the criteria for a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder. He did not, but he did demonstrate some post traumatic symptoms. 
2.Whether the offender's PTSD symptoms impacted on his ability to make proper judgments in committing the offence. His symptoms did impact on his decision making and offending in as far as contributing to his heightened sense of distress in the circumstances.
3.Would his time in custody, be more onerous as a result of his psychological problems? It was believed that any period of incarceration would be likely to contribute to the offender feeling increasingly vulnerable as he was away from his support systems.
4.Whether the offender's condition would be exacerbated by spending time in custody. It was stated that coping in the situation of prolonged incarceration is hard to predict and would depend on whether he was held in protective custody away from other inmates who may want to harm him. 
10Ms Nasr's opinions were not the subject of challenge.
11The applicant gave evidence and verified the history he had provided to Ms Nasr.  With one reservation of no present relevance, his Honour said that he was largely impressed with the evidence given by the applicant.12His Honour also observed that, for his own protection, the applicant had been in protective custody since his arrest although his Honour was not persuaded that the applicant would serve a custodial sentence more onerously than any other offender.
13In 2006 the applicant was placed on good behaviour bonds for common assault and possessing capsicum spray.  Notwithstanding this his Honour concluded that the applicant was of good character, was remorseful, had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. 
14In arriving at the sentence he imposed his Honour concluded that the objective seriousness of the offence was below mid-range but that general deterrence was a matter to be taken into account ""given the apparent increasing prevalence of illegal firearms in the community"".  His Honour also found special circumstances in the fact that this was the applicant's first time in custody, in a need for early counselling and treatment to assist his productive return to the community and because he might require special protection during the time that he is in custody"".
15The first ground of appeal was that ""the sentencing judge erred in taking into account the standard non-parole period"".  His Honour of course was obliged to do so and the gravamen of the complaint seems to be that for an offence that his Honour found was below the mid-point in objective seriousness, his Honour in fact imposed a sentence which, when allowance was made for the applicant's plea, substantially accorded with the standard non-parole period.  Thus it was said that the sentence of 3 years after a 25% allowance for the applicant's plea indicates a commencing point of 4 years and, absent a finding of special circumstances, a non-parole period of 3 years, i.e. the standard non-parole period.  The error was made worse, so the submission ran, because the sentence had to reflect, in addition to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour's findings, favourable to the applicant, as to the latter's subjective circumstances.    
16Were the standard non-parole period the only criterion by which the sentence imposed was to be measured, the submission would have some force.  However, it was not the only criterion.  His Honour had also to take into account the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  This Court has previously remarked that the two standards are irreconcilable - Duncombe v R [2013] NSWCCA 271 at [50] and R v Najem [2008] NSWCCA 32 at [38] - but that regard must be had to both - Duncombe v R  at [53]; Dulihanty v R  [2013] NSWCCA 275 at [79].  When this is done, it is not possible to conclude that his Honour erred in the respect the subject of this ground.
17The second ground of appeal was that ""the sentencing judge erred in failing to regard the offender's mental state as a mitigating factor"".
18I have referred above to Ms Nasr's reports.  Otherwise, all his Honour said on this topic was to record the applicant's submissions that the applicant's mental state at the time was a mitigating factor and that special circumstances existed because, inter alia, the applicant had a need for early counselling and treatment to assist his productive return to the community.  This latter conclusion, so it was submitted, demonstrated acceptance of Ms Nasr's opinion that the applicant ""requires assistance in resolving traumatic stress symptoms"". 
19That last-mentioned submission may be accepted.  It does not follow however that more leniency was required by the evidence just referred to than was afforded by the reduction in the non-parole period that his Honour awarded.  
20On the other hand, the evidence referred to at an earlier stage of these reasons went further and, given the significance attributed to the applicant's mental state, his Honour did err in not expressing his conclusions as to it and what he saw as its significance. 
21That said, the evidence had its limits.  Ms Nasr said that the applicant's symptoms ""contributed"" to his offending but neither in her evidence or elsewhere is there to be found any indication as to the degree to which they did so.  There is nothing to indicate that the applicant's symptoms were of major, or even of more than minor significance, as contributors to his actions.
22Furthermore, the drive-by shooting of the applicant's home and the other threats to which he was subjected provided reason for him to be fearful and his Honour accepted as a mitigating factor that it was this fear that motivated the applicant to commit the offence.  In these circumstances the fact that the applicant's symptoms which were obviously products of that fear were contributing factors could not have been given more than marginal weight.
23There remains for consideration s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which requires the Court to dismiss an appeal against sentence unless it concludes that, in the circumstances here, some sentence less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
24I am not so persuaded.  I have referred to his Honour's remarks concerning general deterrence and the apparent prevalence of illegal firearms in the community.   One cannot be unconscious of the prevalence of drive-by shootings calculated and most probably designed to instil fear, of the reluctance of many victims to talk to police, and the disposition of many to rely on their own methods of retribution.  The applicant's sentence should reflect what he did but it is important that the courts do nothing to encourage self help in the form of criminal conduct - see R v Krstic [2005] NSWCCA 391 at [13], [14] and R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55 at [45], [46].
25I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

2763294,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 124,"Ex TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Sian Regal is a witness who was called yesterday to give evidence by the Crown. She provided a statement to the prosecution that was circulated to the accused before she did so. Paragraph 26 of her statement is in these terms:

""26. Around the same time, I spoke to Wendy. I said 'I had heard Katie was burnt alive and found in the foetal position'. I was freaking out and I didn't know who had down [sic, done] it. Wendy had told me she was in with bikies and drugs, Wendy denied knowing about it. Wendy told me that Brad had told her that they had lit the fire down the stairs so she couldn't get out.""

2That evidence was led from Ms Regal. No oral objection to it was taken at that time, but an application to discharge the jury was made at the conclusion of Ms Regal's evidence-in-chief. That application arose in the following circumstances.

3Mr Terracini SC for Mr Rawlinson indicated that he had provided a copy of Ms Regal's statement to the Crown with the last sentence of paragraph 26 highlighted in yellow, and with an asterisk and the word ""object"" written in the adjacent margins. The Crown was not provided with the statement marked in that way until sometime during Ms Regal's evidence-in-chief. The Crown has indicated that he inadvertently overlooked the markings on the copy of the statement that had been given to him and the evidence was put to the witness and accepted by her before it could be stopped. Although it might arguably be relevant in a different context, I do not consider that there is any present utility in exploring further the question of who, if anyone, was or may have been at fault in the circumstances. It is not in any event suggested by Mr Terracini that what occurred was deliberate or intentional.

4The issue for present purposes is whether or not the evidence has created a prejudice that is incapable of being cured by an appropriate direction to the jury. The prejudice arguably consists in the fact that, if accepted at face value, Ms Evans is suggesting that Mr Rawlinson was present at the scene of the fatal fire, or alternatively was a party to an agreement that included, or extended to, a detailed knowledge of what was to happen at the scene, including how and where the fire was to be started. 

5The Crown case against Mr Rawlinson accepts that he was not present at the scene of the fire and that he did not take any physical part or play any physical role in what happened there. The Crown case against him is that he was a party to an agreement with his co-accused that the deceased should be killed by a fire set in her home while she was present. It is also the Crown case that the only people present at the scene on the morning of the fire were Wendy Evans and Mr Spicer. Consistently with this approach, the Crown case against Mr Spicer relies in part upon his record of interview with the police in which he admitted being at the scene and setting the fire in the company of Ms Evans. It is accepted, of course, that Mr Spicer's record of interview is not admissible as evidence in the Crown case against either of his co-accused.

6The Crown contends that the following direction is adequate and sufficient to cure the perceived or anticipated prejudice:

""During the course of the evidence of Ms Sian Regal yesterday she mentioned some matters that Ms Evans had told her. 

The evidence is 'Wendy told me that she is in with bikie and drugs, Wendy denied knowing anything about it. Wendy told me that Brad had told her that they had lit the fire down the stairs so she couldn't get out.'

This last sentence referring to what Brad was alleged to have said is not evidence against any of the accused. It came before you due to a misunderstanding between counsel and is not relied upon in any way by either the Crown or the defence. Accordingly you should completely disregard it. I direct that you should not use it in any way in your consideration of this case. It will not be the evidence that this fire was lit down the stairs and it is not the Crown case that it was. 

As I have said, you cannot use this piece of evidence of what Wendy Evans said Bradley Rawlinson said, in any way in this trial. It has been removed from the record and it is no part of the evidence.""

7The material in question would appear to be, or is at least consistent with, an attempt by Ms Evans to paint a picture for Ms Regal of what happened that excluded entirely any involvement by her. If one accepts, upon the basis of evidence that has been presented so far, with the (admittedly limited) assistance of the Crown's opening, that only Mr Spicer and Ms Evans were there at the time, then Ms Evans' reference to ""they"", in the expression ""that they had lit the fire"", must be a lie. 

8The Crown does not maintain a case against Mr Rawlinson that attributes or ascribes to him any of the detail to which Ms Evans has referred in her conversation with Ms Regal. Any direction capable of dispelling the prejudicial effect of a suggestion to the contrary should make that clear.

9There is the added possible prejudice that consists of a suggestion that the fire was set in a way that made the deceased's escape difficult or impossible. Three matters arise for consideration in that respect. First, as already mentioned, the Crown case is completely silent on such matters in the case against all accused. No evidence suggests that any detail of the sort referred to by Ms Evans in the evidence complained of will ever emerge. It can be isolated from all other material in the trial and effectively dispelled as entirely enigmatic.

10Secondly, the forensic evidence that is anticipated, and which to some extent is already before the jury, does not support the proposition that the fire was started either downstairs, in the sense that it commenced on the ground floor, or down the stairs, in the sense that the stairway leading down to the ground floor was itself set alight as the perpetrators made good their departure from the first floor. The photographs in the jury bundle do not depict fire damage to the staircase of the type consistent with the fire having been started in either way. The forensic evidence that has been foreshadowed as part of the Crown case in fact is entirely supportive of the proposition that the fire started in the deceased's bedroom upstairs.

11Thirdly, the prejudice alleged must be given consideration in proper context. The evidence appears likely to be, if it is not already, that the deceased was in fact unable to escape the fire. The horror and associated prejudice emanating from that fact alone necessarily, or at least arguably, dilutes the putatively prejudicial effect of the material in question.

12Mr Terracini has proposed that directions in or to the following effect would be preferable to the directions proposed by the Crown: 

""During the course of the evidence of Ms Sian Regal yesterday she mentioned some matters that Ms Evans had told her. 

The evidence is 'Wendy told me that she is in with bikie and drugs, Wendy denied knowing anything about it. Wendy told me that Brad had told her that they had lit the fire down the stairs so she couldn't get out.'

This last sentence referring to what Brad was alleged to have said is not evidence against any of the accused. It came before you due to a misunderstanding between counsel and is not relied upon in any way by either the Crown or the defence. Accordingly you should completely disregard it. I direct that you should not use it in any way in your consideration of this case.

It will not be the evidence that this fire was lit down the stairs and it is not the Crown case that it was.

Members of the Jury, I direct you that it is not the Crown case or the case for the accused that Mr Rawlinson was ever present whilst a fire was started at the home of the deceased Ms Foreman.

I should also remind you that Ms Evans will not be giving any evidence before you and thus any statements made allegedly by her cannot be tested in any way by any of the parties.

As I have said you cannot use this piece of evidence of what Wendy Evans said Bradley Rawlinson said in any way in this trial. Indeed it would be quite wrong to do so. It has been removed from the transcript of this trial and it forms no part of the evidence.""

13In providing these directions in draft, Mr Terracini does not, and I do not take him to, resile from his fundamental position that the jury should be discharged.

14In my view the expanded directions proposed by Mr Terracini are entirely adequate and sufficient to neutralise any real or perceived prejudice that may have arisen from the inadvertent admission of the evidence in question. I propose to reject the application to discharge the jury and to give them the directions last referred to.

2763319,HJ v R [2014] NSWCCA 21,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Garling J.  
2GARLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal in respect of two sentences imposed in the District Court by her Honour, Judge Murrell SC, on 27 August 2013.  
3The applicant, who was a juvenile at the time of the offences, pleaded guilty before Murrell DCJ to two offences contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
4The offences occurred on 29 September 2012, when HJ, together with her partner Mr Barry Kelly, entered a home in Mollymook - having first broken in.  Whilst within the home she committed a serious indictable offence, namely, assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in the company of Mr Kelly upon two victims, Mr Berry (who was then aged 31) and a juvenile referred to as ""A"" (who was then 14).  There were two charges, one relating to each victim.  
5The maximum penalty for each offence was 20 years' imprisonment.  Because HJ was a juvenile at the time, the standard non-parole period had no application.  
6The sentencing Judge imposed wholly concurrent sentences on each for the two offences of 2 years and 1 month with a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing on 27 August 2013.  
7Her Honour made an order under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 directing that the whole of the non-parole period applicable to HJ be served as a juvenile offender.
Facts
8A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge.  A brief summary of these facts follows.
9The victims were Mr Phillip Berry (Count 1) and a juvenile referred to as ""A"" (Count 2).
10At the time of the commission of the offences, both victims resided with A's mother. A's mother and father had separated, her father had moved out of the family home and commenced a relationship with the Applicant's older sister, Nicole.  Nicole had become pregnant by A's father.  Her father made this known to A and told her to keep it secret from her mother.  A disclosed to her mother that Nicole was pregnant. This caused friction between A and her father. 
11The Applicant was in a relationship with Mr Barry Kelly, her co-offender, with whom she would frequently visit Nicole and A's father at their home.  A's father informed the Applicant and her co-offender that A had told her mother that Nicole was pregnant. This caused both the applicant and the co-offender to form a dislike for A. 
12At around 11.30pm on 29 September 2012 the victims were at their home. A received three similar telephone calls from the Applicant in which she verbally abused and threatened the victim. In one such call, the applicant stated: ""I'm coming around to get ya and guess who I'm bringing, your Daddy"".  A then rang her father who stated, ""[HJ]'s coming to bash ya"".  The call was terminated and A went to her bedroom.  Approximately 15 minutes later, Mr Berry called to out A informing her that HJ and the co-offender were at the front door.  A approached the front door and saw the co-offender holding a piece of timber in his hand. The co-offender kicked open the timber entry door. 
13With respect to Count 1, the short facts were that the co-offender entered the victim's home and hit Mr Berry on the head with his hand while Mr Berry was on the telephone with a '000' emergency operator.  Mr Berry fell unconscious to the floor. 
14With respect to Count 2, the short facts were that A heard the Applicant screaming and saw her enter the house.  The Applicant came straight towards A, grabbed her hair and swung her onto the lounge.  The Applicant then jumped on A and commenced to punch her in the head.  The Applicant then dragged A to the floor and kicked her to the head about four times whilst yelling profanities at A.  The Applicant spat in A's face and asked her where her mother was.  After A replied that her mother was in Nowra the Applicant let A go and left the house.  This assault was recorded by the co-offender on his mobile phone. 
15Mr Berry sustained the following injuries as a result of the assault:
(1)A 3cm superficial laceration over his left cheek bone which required 5 sutures(2)An abrasion to his left cheek bone (3)A depressed comminuted fracture of his left zygoma bone, for which there was no surgical intervention, it healed on its own without any long-term affects.
16A sustained the following injuries as a result of the assault: 
(1)Areas of tenderness and mild swelling over both cheekbones and her mandible; and(2)mild widespread patchy tenderness of her scalp and pre-sternal region. 
17Both A and Mr Berry were transferred to hospital.  Before the sentencing Judge the Crown conceded that the injuries sustained by the victims did not amount to grievous bodily harm.
18Early on the morning after the assault, police attended the applicant's home where she was arrested and taken to the police station.  Whilst at the police station the applicant requested medical attention for her right hand.  When the ambulance arrived, she explained to ambulance officers that she had injured her hand as a result of punching someone.
19Police seized mobile phones belonging to the applicant and her co-offender.  On the co-offender's mobile phone, police observed video footage of the applicant assaulting the victim A.  An examination of the applicant's mobile phone contained text messages which indicated that the assault on A was pre-planned.  
Applicant's Submissions on Sentence
20The applicant agreed with the facts to which I have just made reference.  On sentence, she gave evidence herself and relied upon the contents of a report of a clinical psychologist, Ms Caroline Hare.  As well, a Juvenile Justice background report was prepared and tendered to the sentencing Judge.  Counsel made submissions on behalf of the applicant.
21The applicant in her evidence accepted her responsibility for what occurred, and expressed regret for what she had done.  She said that about an hour or two before the incident, her sister's boyfriend (who was 38 years old) had said with respect to his daughter, A, that she deserved to be ""taught a lesson"" and that someone should teach her one.  The applicant said that this was said in her presence, at a time when she was intoxicated. 
22The applicant gave evidence that what she had told the clinical psychologist was accurate and true.
23It would appear from Ms Hare's report that the applicant grew up in a house where her mother and step-father would often argue verbally, and engage in low level physical abuse.  She described her adolescence as one where she began to consume alcohol, she truanted from school, ran away from home and stayed with friends or on the streets.  At the age of 15 the applicant was sent from home to live with her paternal grandfather in Lithgow, which was a considerable distance from her home.  
24Ms Hare summarised HJ's position in the following way:
""47. [HJ] lacked a consistent paternal figure during her upbringing, which appears to have resulted in challenges in her relationship with her mother, who was largely responsible for providing [HJ] with positive role modelling and direction during her upbringing.  [HJ]  appears to have experienced difficulties in relation to learning to manage her emotions effectively.   This has likely been impacted by her poor executive functioning skills.  As a result, [HJ] has developed various unhelpful strategie to assist with managing her emotions, such as expressing her anger via outbursts, engaging in self-harm and suicidal ideation, and misusing alcohol and drugs.  In addition, [HJ]'s below average cognitive functioning and poor executive functioning has likely impacted upon the development of her social skills and problem solving skills, resulting in her being susceptible to negative peer influence in a bid to maintain friendships, or due to a lack of consequential thinking.  These factors appear to have also impacted upon [HJ]'s performance and engagement at school.
48. It is against the above background that [HJ] committed the current offence.  The triggers to the offence appear to have been her emotional arousal (and associated problems managing this) and her poor problem solving.  These skills, which are relatively underdeveloped in [HJ], were further negatively impacted by her use of alcohol.  
25The following subjective matters were also before the sentencing Judge.  HJ had had one unsuccessful relationship at the age of 13.  As a consequence of that relationship, and against the background of her family life, she had not felt able to trust men.  She had also been sexually assaulted at the age of 16.  Accordingly, she had no relationships with men until she met her current partner a few months before the offence.  She clearly had a close relationship with this partner (her co-offender), who was about five years older than her.  
26After the offences had been committed, and prior to the entry of a plea of guilty, the applicant fell pregnant to her partner.  Her pregnancy was not planned and was described by her as ""an accident"".  When she was about three months pregnant, she attempted to commit suicide.  Her youngest brother intervened.  She was not admitted to hospital.  At the time of her assessment by the clinical psychologist, the following was recorded:
""Currently, [HJ] described feeling scared about the future, in terms of her pregnancy, and the prospect of being alone in managing the baby if her partner receives a custodial sentence.  She further expressed concerns that the Department of Community Services will 'be involved' in caring for her child.  This seems like it could be a realistic concern given [HJ]'s emotional vulnerability in terms of her limited ability to effectively manage difficult feelings.  If [HJ]'s partner receives a custodial sentence, that is likely to increase her needs for emotional and practical support, particularly following the birth of her child.""
27That report was completed some months prior to the sentencing.  The pregnancy, according to the Juvenile Justice Report, had the effect that the applicant had ceased to consume alcohol upon becoming aware of the pregnancy, and had ceased contact with a peer group that had had a negative impact upon her behaviour.
28In the period after her offending and prior to her sentencing, HJ had enrolled in a vocational TAFE course with a view to obtaining employment.
29Her Honour was told in the submissions of the applicant's co-offender that his baby son had been born a little over three weeks earlier on 3 August 2013.  In the submissions of the applicant's lawyer, her Honour was reminded of this, and informed that the birth of her son was the cause for the applicant putting her TAFE studies on hold for six months.
Other Subjective Matters
30The applicant was born in January 1995, and was accordingly 17 years and 8 months at the time of the offence.  She was 18 years and 7 months at the time of her sentencing.  She had no criminal history at all, this being her first offence.  She was living with her co-offender's family at the time of her sentencing.
Remarks on Sentence
31At the start of her Remarks on Sentencing, the sentencing Judge recorded the nature of the offences, when they were committed and the fact that the aggravating feature in respect of each case was that the offender was in company.  She then said:
""The maximum available penalty is 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years applies.  Each offender entered a plea of guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity and is entitled to a 25 per cent discount for the plea.""
32Her Honour was engaged in sentencing both the applicant and her co-offender.  This was the only time in her Sentencing Remarks to which her Honour made reference to the standard non-parole period.
33Her Honour recited the facts and the nature of the injuries suffered by the two victims.  
34She went on to describe the subjective factors of the applicant's co-offender and then came to consider the subjective factors relating to the applicant.  She noted that HJ was a child at the time of the offence, and that she was obliged to deal with the sentence which she was imposing by reference to the provisions of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.  
35Her Honour noted that the approach to sentencing of young offenders was different from that taken to adults, and was to be more focussed on enabling them to remain in the community and to continue with their education.  She also acknowledged ""that children have a lesser capacity in terms of decision-making and are intellectually and emotionally less mature than adults"".  
36Her Honour recounted the applicant's family history and her growing up.  She noted that the applicant had been sexually assaulted when she was 16 years of age in an incident which was very traumatic.  She noted the applicant continued to suffer from sequelae of that offence.  
37Her Honour then said this:
""She has been assessed as functioning at a below average level, particularly in the area of executive functioning.  She has presented as an introverted and quiet person to people who assessed her.  It is said that she needs help in the areas of executive functioning, substance abuse and developing a pro-social network.  She commenced a TAFE course but discontinued it, I think, in connection with the recent birth of her child.""
38Her Honour turned to the objective seriousness of the offences.  She noted that the applicant was the instigator of the offences and had primarily planned them; that she had consumed a substantial quantity of alcohol prior to the offences for the purpose of ""strengthening her resolve"".  And that although the victim, A, whom the applicant had attacked personally had sustained soft tissue injuries amounting to actual bodily harm, communications by the applicant both before and after the incident suggested that she envisaged quite serious injuries to the victim.
39Her Honour was satisfied that there was a ""disturbing level of pre-planning and premeditated violence"".  Her Honour was not satisfied that the applicant's below average level of functioning had any bearing on the attack, and her Honour concluded that the attack was not impulsive and was cowardly.  As well, she noted that the attack took place in the home of the victim, A.
40Her Honour formed the view that the objective gravity of the offence and the objective seriousness of it was such, that no such sentence other than a term of full time imprisonment was appropriate.  Her Honour accepted that there were special circumstances applicable to the applicant being her youth and the absence of any prior criminal history.
41Her Honour then proceeded to impose a sentence.  In so doing, she did not make any further specific reference to the discount for the early plea of guilty, although her Honour had earlier in her Remarks on Sentence, noted that both the applicant and her co-offender had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and were entitled to a 25 per cent discount for their plea.
42Her Honour imposed an identical sentence with respect to each Count with which the applicant was charge.  She ordered that both of the sentences be wholly concurrent.  Her Honour imposed a sentence which comprised:
(a)a non-parole period of 12 months commencing on 27 August 2013; and(b)a balance of term of 13 months concluding on 26 September 2015.
43At the specific request of counsel for the applicant, her Honour directed that the term of imprisonment be served in juvenile detention.
Grounds of Appeal
44The applicant proceeded with an Amended Application for Leave to Appeal which was filed, without objection from the Crown, on 20 February 2014.  There were four grounds noted in her application.  They were:
(1)The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account an irrelevant matter, namely, the applicability of the standard non-parole period in relation to the applicant who was under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the offences;
(2)The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the applicant's youth and, in particular, failed to have proper regard to the relationship between the applicant's immaturity and the commission of the offences;
(3)In the circumstances of the case, the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive;
(4)The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to a matter relevant to the sentencing process, namely, that the applicant had a four week old baby at the time of sentence.
Ground 1 - Error in Considering Standard Non-Parole Period
45The applicant submits that the reference to the standard non-parole period which has been set out at [31], made by her Honour in the course of her Remarks on Sentence, demonstrated error because the standard non-parole period was not applicable to the applicant in respect of these offences because she was under 18 at the time they were committed. 
46There is no dispute that the standard non-parole period was entirely irrelevant to the sentencing exercise upon which the sentencing Judge was engaged, with regard to the applicant.
47It is to be recalled that the sentencing Judge was asked to sentence both the applicant and her co-offender together.  The sentencing proceedings proceeded together.  Submissions were taken at the same time and the Crown responded to the submissions jointly.  Her Honour's Remarks on Sentence were delivered jointly with respect to the applicant and her co-offender.  
48The co-offender was an adult at the time of the offending and, accordingly, was a person to whom the standard non-parole period applied.  
49The only reference to the standard non-parole period was made at the very start of her Honour's Remarks on Sentencing, and there was no further reference to the standard non-parole period at any later time, including how it would be used consistently with the authorities.  
50The reference to the standard non-parole period upon which the applicant relies was a generic reference when the sentencing Judge was setting out the nature of the offences, when they occurred and the maximum penalty applicable to the offences.  
51Her Honour's reference to the standard non-parole period was not made specifically in relation to the applicant.  It is explicable in the context in which it was used, to being relevant to the co-offender.  Her Honour's later references to the fact that the applicant was a juvenile at the time, and that she was bound to apply the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act when sentencing the applicant, all combine to satisfy me that such reference as her Honour made to the standard non-parole period was intended to relate to the co-offender and not to the applicant.  
52The absence of any further reference to the standard non-parole period and the proper use to be made of it, makes it plain to me that her Honour did not have any additional regard to it and did not take it into account when sentencing the applicant.
53I am not satisfied that the reference relied upon by the applicant indicated any error on the part of the sentencing Judge.  
54Ground 1 should not be upheld.
Ground 2 - Failure to have Proper Regard to the Applicant's Youth and Immaturity
55The applicant submits that notwithstanding a number of references by the sentencing Judge to the fact that she was a child, that different sentencing principles applied to her and that as children are intellectually and emotionally less mature than adults, the sentences imposed demonstrate that insufficient regard was taken of the applicant's youth and immaturity.
56It is undoubted that the youth of an offender is a relevant factor to be considered in assessing what sentence ought be imposed.  The Court makes an allowance for the youth of the offender because immaturity is usually involved.  Where that immaturity is a significant contributing factor to an offence, then it may fairly be said that the criminality involved is less than it would be in the case of an adult of more mature years: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25].
57In MS2 v R [2005] NSWCCA 397, Adams J said at [16]:
""... immaturity is relevant to culpability or criminality.  The point may be put simply: children do not have adult value judgments, adult experience, adult appreciation of consequences - especially catastrophic consequences - or adult understanding of criminal culpability.  That is, of course, not to say that depending on age and background, they cannot be intentionally wicket and know very well that what they do or intend to do is seriously wrong and even criminal. ...""
58It is also clear that the younger an offender is, the greater will be the weight to be put upon the offender's youth.  Conversely, the closer the age of the offender to the age of adulthood, then the less the weight will be on factors such as immaturity and age.  
59There is no doubt that the applicant was immature.  She was easily influenced and led.  Her history suggests she was lacking a good role model.  However, these were all matters which were well before the sentencing Judge.  She adverted to them.  There is nothing about the sentence itself which suggests that her Honour did not have careful regard to them.  
60I am not satisfied that there is any indication that her Honour fell into error on account of failing to have proper regard to the relationship between the applicant's immaturity and the commission of the offences.  On the contrary, the material emanating from the applicant, in particular the various text messages, suggested a far more adult approach to this crime than that of an immature girl.
61I would not uphold this Ground.  
Ground 4 - Relevance of the Applicant's Four Week Old Baby
62It is convenient to proceed next to this Ground before considering Ground 3.  
63It is accepted on this appeal that in the correctional system in NSW, there are no facilities for mothers and babies to live together whilst an offender is in any juvenile detention facility.  On the other hand, if an offender enters the adult correctional system, there is a facility at Jacaranda House where mothers in custody can have their baby with them.  These facts are well known, and have been the subject of previous comment by this Court: R v XYJ (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 15 June 1992); R v SLR [2000] NSWCCA 436; (2000) 116 A Crim R 150.
64Accordingly, as her Honour sentenced the applicant to serve her imprisonment in a juvenile facility, this necessarily meant that the applicant would be separated from her young baby for the entire period of her imprisonment.  
65The applicant submits on appeal that, as well as the authorities to which it will be necessary to come, s 6(f) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, identifies a principle which is here relevant, namely:
""(f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties.""
The applicant submits that this principle is apt to be applied here. 
66The relevance of an offender who stands for sentence being the mother of a young baby is undoubted.  It is always a question of weight as to the impact which this factor has on the sentencing process.
67This Court has held that the fact that a person to be sentenced is the mother of young baby is a relevant factor to take into account: see R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522; (2001) 127 A Crim R 23.  In that case, the applicant was standing for sentence about two months after her baby was born.  That fact was well known to the sentencing Judge who had adjourned the proceedings on sentence to await the birth of the applicant's child.  At [5] Spigelman CJ said with respect to an alleged failure by the sentencing Judge to deal with the matter appropriately because the sentencing Judge had imposed an order suspending the sentence of imprisonment, this:
""Furthermore, the order suspending the sentence could not be justified on the basis that the respondent would be separated from her child for an unknown period.  His Honour could, and should, have deferred sentencing until the respondent had been assessed, so that the Court knew whether or not there would be any separation.""
68The Chief Justice went on to say, at [7]:
""In an appropriate case, the inability of prison authorities to provide for detention in a humane manner will justify a court refusing to impose a custodial sentence.  That was not shown to be the case here.  His Honour was correct to conclude that the evidence from the Department of Corrective Services revealed a process that involved unacceptable delays so that the probable separation of mother and baby could be regarded as inhumane.  However, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that, by deferring by the sentencing task, he may have been able to ensure that, with the cooperation of authorities and subject to a positive assessment, there would be no such separation.""
69It was noted in Togias, where the applicant was an adult, that the provisions of s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required a court to have regard to, where relevant, ""the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants"".
70It was noted that the authorities provided that exceptional circumstances needed to exist before that provision could be considered: R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516-517; R v Ceissman (2001) 119 A Crim R 535 at 540-541 [36].
71As the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Togias demonstrates, Articles 3.1, 9.1 and 9.4 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989, may all have relevance.  However, I note in this case no party drew attention to these provisions, or sought to rely upon them for the purpose of any submissions.  Accordingly, in the absence of full argument, it is inappropriate for this Court to deal with the relevance of this Convention.
72At [67] of Togias, Grove J (with whom Spigelman CJ agreed) with respect to whether or not the sentencing Judge ought to have adjourned the proceedings to obtain further information with respect to the applicant and her child, said this:
""Adjournment sine die is not contemplated but a limited delay to obtain useful information.  What was required was firm evidence of what conditions would pertain in relation to this respondent and her child in the event that an order committing her to prison were to be made.  The evidence tendered was limited to generalities.  No attempt was made to obtain focussed information.  It is possible that a response in particular terms may not be forthcoming from Corrective Services, but such situation would need to be take into account if it arose.  His Honour elected to proceed without knowing what the situation was in this regard.""
73In SLR this Court held in circumstances where the applicant was pregnant at the time of sentencing, that the fact that the Juvenile Justice Centre, where the applicant was then detained, would not be able to accommodate the applicant's newborn child immediately following its birth, and that no other juvenile facilities in NSW were available which could so accommodate them, was a relevant factor for the sentencing Judge to take into account.  
74Interestingly, in light of the material agreed in this Court about appropriate arrangements for mothers and young babies in custody, to which no attention was paid in the Court below, the Crown in SLR submitted that 
""... the applicant should not be separated from her newborn baby because an order directing her to serve her sentence in a detention centre in advertently deprived her of a facility which is available to adult female prisoners namely, to keep their babies with them up until the age of 5 years.""
75In SLR, in circumstances where the sentencing Judge had not specifically adverted to the inability of the applicant to have her child with her after birth, this Court intervened to alter the sentence imposed upon the offender.  The effect of the alteration was to ensure that after the birth of the offender's child, she was transferred to an adult prison where facilities were available to keep her child and where an application could be made for leave under the then current s 29(2)(c) of the Correctional Centres Act 1952.  That provision now exists, in similar terms, in s 26 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.
76It is clear that in this case, first, it was a matter of relevance and importance to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the fact that the applicant was the mother of a young baby, and the effect of separation from her baby needed to be considered, both with respect to the applicant herself, and the degree to which the separation would have impacted upon the hardship of her period in custody; secondly, if exceptional circumstances could have been shown it was relevant to have regard to any effect on the applicant's child; and thirdly, given that there were no facilities for the applicant to be with her baby whilst in juvenile custody, consideration should have been given to declining to make an order that she serve her term of imprisonment in juvenile detention, which necessarily meant that she would be separated from her baby.
77No attention was given to any of these matters in the sentencing Judge's Remarks and, accordingly, error has been demonstrated.
78Ground 4 must be upheld.
79This does not necessarily automatically mean that the applicant's sentence needs to be re-determined.  The Court needs to consider whether, in all of the circumstances any lesser sentence is warranted: see s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
80The error which has been identified was in the circumstances here, a significant one.  In a case involving a young offender who has pleaded guilty to serious offences and who has no previous criminal record, a matter relevant to her subjective case which ought to have played a central role tending to mitigate any penalty, was not addressed.
81In my view, any consideration of this issue would have resulted in a decision ameliorating any sentence which was to be imposed.  As a result, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed.
82In those circumstances, it is necessary to set aside the sentences imposed below and re-sentence the applicant.
83Because the sentences below are to be set aside, it is inappropriate to give any consideration to Ground 3 dealing with whether the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.
Re-sentencing
84It is necessary to re-sentence the applicant.  
85As the earlier remarks in this judgment will show, the applicant not been convicted of any prior criminal offence.  Prior to entering custody, the applicant was in a reasonably stable relationship, albeit with her co-offender.  She was attending TAFE until she fell pregnant and suspended her TAFE course pending the birth of her child.  Her son was born on 3 August 2013.
86The applicant's present position is the subject of additional affidavit evidence to which I have had careful regard.  
87Because she and her co-offender are in custody, her son spends time alternatively with the applicant's mother in the Lithgow area, or with her co-offender's mother in the Nowra area.  Since the applicant has been in jail, she has seen her son on no more than six occasions.  The limited number of visits is largely due to the difficulty in either her mother or her partner's mother bringing her son to see her.  The longest she has been with her son since she has been in custody is four hours in January 2014.  
88Since being confined to custody, the applicant has attended school five days per week and is undertaking a number of courses.  She has completed courses with respect to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.  She has received a number of certificates commending her on her efforts in the various education courses which she has undertaken.  As well, she has been participating in a Karitane parents program two days per week so as to understand the stages of life through which her baby is moving.  
89The applicant in her affidavit deposes to the fact that she has had a meeting with a mental health worker whilst in custody who has offered her assistance whenever she may be released, with drug and alcohol counselling, anger management counselling, and reintegrating into the community as a mother.  That support is possible in the Nowra area where the applicant proposes to live upon her release from custody.  
90The applicant has provided to the Court records of her stay in custody which indicate that in December 2013, an episode of misbehaviour whilst in custody had been the subject of a formal report with respect to the inappropriate content of letters which had been passed between herself and another young person in the unit in which she was housed.  The letters contained a threat towards an ex-detainee.  The formal report concludes:
""[HJ] will be required to discuss her attitude towards violence, anger management, developing strategies to manage her emotions and explore the correlation to her offence.""
91By January 2014, a follow up report by a Juvenile Justice counsellor reported that the applicant demonstrated insight into her misbehaviour, and that her behaviour had improved.  According to the counsellor, the applicant displayed remorse for her actions and continued to assert that she had improved her behaviour and wished to continue with such improvement.
92The applicant was under 18 at the time of the offences, and her youth is necessarily a factor that must be taken into account.  However, as this Court has said on many occasions, the closer in age of a juvenile to adulthood, the less mitigating the effect youth will have.  Here, the applicant was 17 years and 8 months at the time of the offences.
93The offences were serious.  As demonstrated by the facts recounted earlier, there was an element of pre-planning to the offences, they were initiated by the applicant and involved infliction of actual bodily harm on the two victims, one of whom was only 14 years old.  
94Another matter to which the Court must have regard is that the applicant's co-offender received the same sentences as the applicant, but a slightly longer non-parole period than the applicant did.  The applicant's co-offender was an adult at the time, whereas the applicant was a juvenile.
95There is no doubt that the separation of a young mother of the applicant's age from her young baby, and the particular circumstances of her custody, and the very limited access which she has had to her baby, has meant that she has and will continue to suffer a good deal more personal hardship by her imprisonment.
96There is no evidence upon which this Court could find that any adverse effect on the baby of the separation from the applicant is sufficient to warrant a finding of exceptional circumstances, such as would enable any such effect to be taken into account as a mitigating factor.  No such finding is made.  
97In all of the circumstances, I am of the view that the sentence imposed by the original sentencing Judge by way of the overall length of the term is appropriate having regard to the seriousness of the offences.  However, in the particular subjective circumstances of this applicant, I am of the view that the non-parole period should be reduced to 6 months to take full account of the hardship of the applicant's custody which has required her separation from her firstborn baby.
98Having regard to the applicant's reported misbehaviour whilst in custody, albeit on one occasion, when she is released to parole the applicant ought be required to submit herself to ongoing supervision of the Juvenile Justice Service, and to undertake such courses as the Service requires, including anger management courses.
99I propose the following orders:
(1)Application for leave granted.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)Order that the sentence imposed in the District Court (Murrell DCJ) on 27 August 2013 with respect to both offences be varied so as to provide that the non-parole period with respect to each count, be a period of 6 months commencing on 27 August 2013 and expiring on 26 February 2014.
(4)Order that the applicant be forthwith admitted to parole upon condition that she is to report to the Juvenile Justice Service at Nowra within 96 hours of her release from custody, submit to their supervision and comply with all reasonable directions of the Service with respect to counselling and education including but not limited to anger management and alcohol-related issues.
(5)In all other respects, the sentence is confirmed.
100R S HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J and with his Honour's reasons.

Introduction

3The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 28 November 2012 for the offence of hindering the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence committed by another person, an offence under s 315(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 3 years, commencing on 21 March 2013, with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring on 20 September 2014. The sentence reflected a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea. Accordingly, the starting point for the sentence was 4 years imprisonment. The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence upon the single ground that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

4When the hearing of the appeal concluded on 26 February 2014, the Court made the following orders -

(i)leave to appeal is granted;

(ii)the appeal is allowed;

(iii)the sentence under appeal is quashed;

(iv)pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, no penalty is imposed;

(v)reasons to be published on 28 February 2014.

These are my reasons for concurring with those orders. 

The facts of the offence

5An agreed statement of facts was tendered, which was set out in the learned primary judge's reasons for sentence and from which the following account is largely taken. 

6On 2 March 2012 in Tamworth, Michael Jacobs shot Senior Constable David Rixon, who died in hospital a short time later. Before he collapsed unconscious, the police officer fired four shots, three of which struck Jacobs. A firearm found at the scene contained two fired and two unfired .38 calibre cartridges marked with a particular label (not suggested to be in anyway uncommon). Ballistic tests of the firearm established it was the weapon which was used in the crime and further forensic testing identified Jacobs' DNA on it. 

7During the afternoon of 2 March 2012 premises in Olive Lane, Tamworth, occupied by Jacobs, his partner Sharon Strudwick and her son, James Strudwick were declared a crime scene and placed under police guard. In the evening of 2 March 2012 a crime scene warrant was executed at the premises, Ms Strudwick being present at the time. During the search, a number of items were collected. On 6 March 2012 police commenced interception of Ms Strudwick's mobile service. About two weeks later Jacobs was charged with the murder of Senior Constable Rixon and refused bail. 

8One week after Jacobs was charged with murder, investigating police attended at the Olive Lane premises to execute another crime scene warrant. As the house appeared to be unoccupied, police telephoned Ms Strudwick's mobile service. She was then driving a motor vehicle with the applicant as a passenger. As it happened, the call was answered by the applicant, who handed the phone to Ms Strudwick who, on being told that police were at her residence with a crime scene warrant, said that her son James was inside and she had told him not to open the door. Ms Strudwick was requested to go to the house and provide entry. About 10 minutes later James was telephoned, either by Ms Strudwick or the applicant, using Ms Strudwick's mobile telephone. 

9The conversation was intercepted by police. The transcript starts off with an exchange between the applicant and Ms Strudwick about telling James to get ""the bullets"" from a handbag hanging on one of the doors. The applicant then told Ms Strudwick that she should talk to James but, because she was driving, Ms Strudwick asked her to do so. When James answered the phone the applicant asked, on the prompting of Ms Strudwick, whether the police had arrived. The applicant told James to go to his mother's room, take the bullets out of the bag hanging on the door and put them in her (the applicant's) bag. Ms Strudwick said (in effect) they were in a box, which she described. This was relayed to James by the applicant. There follows a conversation about where the box should be hidden, again the applicant relaying Ms Strudwick's instructions. After a further short exchange, Ms Strudwick suggested that the box should be placed inside the toilet, this being relayed to James by the applicant. Shortly after, James confirmed that he had done as requested and the applicant ending by saying, ""Thank you brother"". 

10Having heard this conversation, police (who were outside at the time) forced entry immediately and commenced to execute the warrant. James was alone. The applicant and Ms Strudwick arrived a short time later. During the search, the rear yard was excavated and access was gained to the sewer pipe in which a box was found which contained 27 unfired .38 calibre cartridges, 20 of which were the same type as those which had been found in the revolver used by Jacobs. On 5 July 2012 the applicant was arrested at Parramatta Police Station and charged. She declined to speak to police. 

The objective seriousness of the offence

11That the offence was committed in connection with an investigation with the crime of murder, is a marker of significant seriousness. On the other hand, the police were in fact not hindered in their investigation (although it was necessary to perform some excavation in order to discover the ammunition). It was accepted by the Crown and, indeed by the primary judge, that the applicant had not acted in a premeditated way nor, indeed, at her own instigation but, rather, on the spur of the moment at the request of Ms Strudwick. Although the primary judge found that she showed no reluctance in doing so, at one point suggesting the bullets should be placed in her bag, and it is not disputed that the applicant was not just a mouthpiece for Ms Strudwick, her role was very much a secondary one. 

12The primary judge described as ""overstating it"" the Crown's submission that the crime fell within the middle of the range of offences of this type, concluding that ""it is in the lower part of the middle range"". Even so, her Honour's starting point was well over half the maximum prescribed penalty. This is not to suggest, of course, that the middle of the range of objective seriousness suggests a sentence at half the statutory maximum. Nevertheless, it is difficult to relate her Honour's measure of objective seriousness to the starting point. It is, perhaps, worth observing at this point that this assumes that there were no mitigating subjective features. 

Subjective features

13The applicant, an Aboriginal, was just under 29 years of age at the time of the offence. She was in the late stage of pregnancy at the time. As at the date of sentence this child was in the care of the Department of Community Services and her four other children from different partners were all in the care of their extended families following intervention by DOCS for reasons of domestic violence inflicted by those partners on the applicant and the environment of drug use within the home. On one occasion, the applicant was so seriously assaulted that she was placed in intensive care with serious facial injuries and possible brain injury and, on another occasion, she was stabbed in the abdomen. The applicant's early childhood was fraught. She was brought up in a home where alcohol fuelled domestic violence occurred between her parents and she was moving constantly to live with different relatives and refuges to escape the violence. She was often the victim of her father's physical and psychological abuse. The applicant's mother reported to the Probation and Parole Officer a belief that the applicant suffered from symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder as a result of her experiences of violence. The applicant left school at the age of 15 years after having completed year 9, initially being employed as a casual cleaner but without gainful employment since 2008. 

14The applicant used cannabis since the age of 18 and, when she lost her children at the age of 27, oxycontin, an opiate derivative. Although she denied that she was addicted, she used this drug regularly and had commenced a methadone maintenance program in May 2012 prior to her admission into custody. As at 7 November 2012 and (as I understand it) at the time of sentencing she was still on that program. 

15The applicant's criminal record commences with the offence of stealing from the person for which she was charged some three months short of her 16th birthday. The next offence (to which was ascribed some importance by the primary judge) was an offence of threatening or causing injury to a witness, which was committed on 5 December 1998. In respect of these two offences the applicant was placed on a recognisance for 12 months. However, on 6 November 1999 the applicant was charged with malicious damage and was given a further recognisance on 24 January 2000. She was also dealt with in the Children's Court in 1999 for stealing from a motor vehicle and was given a recognisance. On 2 April 2002 she was fined for shoplifting. In February 2003 she was convicted of making a false representation resulting in police investigation for which she was fined and, in January 2005 she was fined for offensive behaviour. There then followed several driving offences. She was fined again in October 2002 on a charge of common assault. In August 2005 the applicant was convicted of offensive behaviour and given a s 9 bond for 12 months. There was a further conviction of common assault for which she was given a 12 months bond. In May and August 2008 she was convicted of a number of further shoplifting offences for which the outcomes were non-custodial. A further shoplifting conviction occurred in May 2010. In February 2011 she was convicted of another offence of shoplifting and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, which, on appeal, was reduced to time served with parole ordered for the balance of the sentence. In February and April 2011 three driving offences occurred and, on 7 November 2012 she was convicted of a further offence of shoplifting and an offence (three counts) of supplying a prohibited drug. In respect of the first of these she was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and, on the second, 9 months imprisonment cumulative, thus a total term of 12 months. Accordingly, when the applicant was sentenced on 28 November 2012, she was still serving the sentence imposed for the drug offences, then due to conclude on 20 June 2013. The term of the sentence under appeal commenced on 21 March 2013, thus being concurrent with the sentence the applicant was then serving for a period of three months, resulting in an additional term of imprisonment of 15 months before expiration of the 18 months non-parole period.

16The primary judge regarded it as significant when assessing the element of specific deterrence that ""the prisoner has previously committed an offence of a similar type, albeit a very long time ago and bearing in mind at that time, as I have already emphasised, she was aged in the order of 15 years and nine months"".

17The Probation and Parole report stated that the applicant would be suitable for supervision.

Discussion 

18It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentence is manifestly excessive. As I have already pointed out, it appears that, having regard to the primary judge's characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence, the starting point selected by her Honour does not appear to reflect any allowance for mitigating circumstances. Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the applicant, rightly points out that there was no suggestion that the applicant stood to benefit in any way or was motivated by anything other than, as it appears, her friendship with Ms Strudwick. It is submitted that such an uncalculating secondary involvement in the offence strongly suggested, if not the lowest seriousness, very much less than middle range seriousness. 

19So far as the applicant's prior conviction for the offence involving the witness is concerned, the circumstances were that the applicant (who was then less than 16 years of age) had been identified by the witness as having knocked a wallet from the victim's hand and taking 100 dollars in cash from it. About a week later, the applicant accosted the witness in the street, grabbed him by the shirt, spun him round and punched him several times to the chest claiming that he and another had ""dobbed me in for that purse snatch"". There was no suggestion that the attack was in any way planned as distinct from an accidental meeting or that the assault was other than impulsive or caused any injury. To my mind its relevance as an offence involving the administration of justice pales into insignificance having regard to the fact that it was committed something over 13 years earlier, when the applicant was a teenager. It is also relevant to observe that the use of drugs was not implicated in the present offence.

20At the sentence proceedings and for the present application the applicant relied on statistics for offences under s 315(1)(a) (hindering the investigation of a serious indictable offence) as well as s 315(1)(c) (hindering the apprehension of a person who has committed a serious indictable offence) as well as the offence in question, to expand the statistical base. These offences all carry the same maximum penalty. The statistics involve such a limited number of cases, however, as to be of very limited utility when one bears in mind the wide variations of circumstances coming within the paragraphs. Also tendered were summaries of cases involving the offences in this Court and the Supreme Court, at least so far as the offences in paras 315(1)(a) and 315 (1)(b) are concerned. I do not propose to set out the summaries here but the cases should be noted: R v Mobbs [2005] NSWCCA 371 (fixed term 4 months); Mobbs v R [2005] NSWCCA 438 (periodic detention for 6 months and 11 days); R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116 (18 months, non-parole period 6 months); R v Lawrence [2004] NSWCCA 404 (2 years and 6 months, non-parole period 6 months); R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44 (5 years, non-parole period 3 years); R v Richmond [2000] NSWCCA 173 (300 hours community service, Crown appeal dismissed on exercise of residual discretion); R v Slacke [2013] NSWSC 1215 (s 9 bond for 2 years); R v Weston [2012] NSWSC 1498 (12 months suspended sentence); R v Grant [2012] NSWSC 1491 (12 months suspended sentence); R v Hamze [2005] NSWSC 136 (with Form 1 offences, periodic detention for 2 years and 3 months, non-parole period of 18 months); R v Ahmad [2005] NSWSC 848 (9 months suspended sentence); R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWSC 1028 (suspended sentence of 1 year and 5 months, non-parole period of 12 months reduced by 3 months to reflect pre-sentence custody); R v Skinner [2000] NSWSC 303 (s 9 bond for 3 years); R v Bailey [2006] NSWSC 49 (2 months fixed term). It is sufficient to say that each of these cases involved objective circumstances of significantly greater seriousness than the present case. 

21It is worth noting, also, that although the prosecutor submitted and the primary judge apparently accepted that the locating of the ammunition was significant to the investigation, there was no attempt to establish why this should be so - although in fairness, it should be noted that no issue was made of this by the applicant's solicitor. The presence in Jacob's home of similar ammunition to that used in the shooting may well have been potentially significant as a circumstantial fact tending to support the likelihood of his being the shooter. 

22The applicant's subjective circumstances were strong. Although she did not express remorse, her plea of guilty was rightly given some weight by the primary judge as evidence of remorse. Her upbringing in very difficult circumstances which did not later much improve should be regarded as playing a role in her failure to resist the request made of her. In addition, there was evidence that she was suffering from depression having been prescribed antidepressant and antipsychotic medication to manage her symptoms of depression and anxiety following her admission into custody. 

Conclusion

23With respect to the primary judge, I have concluded that the ground of appeal has been made out and that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Whilst, of course, it does not follow from the cases cited (referred to above) that the sentence under appeal is manifestly excessive, they fortify my respectful conclusion that the primary judge's discretion miscarried. 

24On the hearing of the application, affidavits were read (subject to the usual condition) from the applicant's solicitor attaching certificates of achievement from various programmes undertaken by the applicant in custody, from the applicant's mother as to her disablement by illness and need for her daughter's care and family support, and from the applicant herself as to the steps she has taken by way of rehabilitation and her plans for the future. This information supports the appropriateness of the ultimate order made. 

25In my view, a sentence of 12 months imprisonment, suspended in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is warranted in law and should have been passed. However, the applicant has already spent some 11 months in custody and it is not fitting to impose such a sentence at this point. Accordingly, an order under s 10A of the Act is appropriate.

26R A HULME J: The reasons given in the judgment of Adams J reflect why I joined in the orders made by the Court on 26 February 2014.

		28 February 2014",2014-02-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763350,R v Paterson (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 162,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1On 10 February 2014 Rodney Paterson (""the accused"") pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging the following:  
(i)that he did, on or about 1 February 1992, at Bundeena in the State of New South Wales, murder Pia Navida;
(ii)that he did, on or about 1 February 1992, at Bundeena in the State of New South Wales, have sexual intercourse with Pia Navida without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in the company of Steve Isac Matthews.
2The accused was originally jointly indicted with Steve Isac Matthews (""Matthews"").  On 3 February 2014, Matthews pleaded guilty to the murder of Pia Navida (""the deceased"").  A count of aggravated sexual assault was contained in a Form 1.  
3At the close of the Crown case on Thursday 27 February 2014, senior counsel for the accused made an application that I direct verdicts of not guilty in respect of both counts in the indictment, along with the statutory alternative to count 1.  That application was opposed by the Crown.  Having heard submissions from both parties I adjourned the matter until Monday 3 March 2014 in order to deliver judgment.  
AN OVERVIEW OF THE CROWN CASE4A summary of the Crown case is set out in an earlier interlocutory judgment I gave in these proceedings (see R v Paterson (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 29).  However, it is appropriate that I set out parts of that summary in order to properly put the present application in context, before proceeding to consider some of the evidence.
5In the late morning of 1 February 1992 the naked body of a female, later identified as the deceased, was found in the Royal National Park.  It was subsequently determined that the deceased's death had been caused by head injuries suffered as a consequence of being struck with a rock which was found near her body.  The deceased had last been seen alive on the previous day, 31 January 1992.  
6Various swabs were taken from the deceased's body at the scene, as well as at a post mortem examination conducted on 2 February 1992.  These  included swabs from her vagina and rectum.  Samples of her fingernails were also taken. Initial analyses of the vaginal and rectal swabs indicated the presence of semen. 
7Police investigations established that the deceased was a Filipina who had lived a nomadic lifestyle over the preceding 13 months.  She earned a limited income from prostitution and was in the habit of frequenting a café in Surry Hills known as ""Greasies"", from where she would periodically purchase drugs.    
8It is the Crown case that notwithstanding the evidence of the deceased having worked as a prostitute, she was not at the Royal National Park as a result of any agreement to provide sexual services to a client.  Rather, the Crown case is that the deceased's murder was sexually motivated, and involved her being driven to the Royal National Park, sexually assaulted, and then killed.    
9In 2006 technological advances in DNA analysis saw further testing of the swabs taken from the deceased.  DNA consistent with that of Matthews was identified as a result of that testing.  
10Further testing was carried out in 2011 which identified Matthews' DNA on the vaginal swab taken from the deceased.  That testing also identified the accused's DNA on swabs taken from the deceased's rectum and right breast, as well as on the deceased's fingernails.  That same testing also identified the presence of the DNA of another male, referred to as ""unknown male A"", on the swab taken from the deceased's rectum.  DNA from at least three individuals was also identified on other items, including a string of beads which had been found on the deceased's naked body.  
11The accused was first interviewed by police on 10 August 2009.  He told police on that occasion that he did not recognise photographs of the deceased or Matthews.  He agreed that he was in the habit of frequenting Greasies Café and also admitted that he had travelled to Queensland with Matthews and another male in early 1992, shortly after the deceased's murder.      
12The accused was interviewed for a second time on 2 August 2011.  In light of later statements made by the accused in recorded telephone conversations, the Crown alleges that a number of answers given by the accused to questions asked of him in each of the two interviews constitute lies which amount to evidence of a consciousness of guilt.      
THE CROWN PROSECUTOR'S OPENING ADDRESS13In his opening address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor put the Crown case on the count of murder in the following terms (commencing at T 81 line 42):  
""In relation to murder, murder can be established if someone does an act or participates in an act where they have an intention to kill, which you might think would seem obvious, or an intention to inflict really serious bodily harm. The Crown in this case anticipates the evidence will be that the Crown case being that the accused participated either by helping in restraining the deceased when she was struck, the blow that killed her or blows, or that he participated in striking himself the deceased. 
If you do find then you would draw from that, the Crown says, that he shared an intention with those other persons to kill or to at least inflict really serious harm to Pia Navida (my emphasis)."" 
14The Crown case in respect of the count of aggravated sexual assault was put in the following terms (commencing at T 82 line 3):
""In relation to count 2, it will be the Crown case and the Crown will put to you that you will draw from the circumstances the facts that you find, the circumstance that you find, that at the time shortly before the death of Pia Navida the accused had sexual intercourse with Pia Navida without her consent, that he knew she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in the company of Steve Matthews and it is the case, the evidence you will hear the Crown anticipates and will be submitting to you at the end, that there was not only Steve Matthews but another person, a male, who at this stage has not been identified."" 
15The Crown went on to say (commencing at T 82 line 23):
""It will be the Crown case that you can draw that inference that this was a case where she struggled and was being detained and held by persons whilst sexual intercourse took place, which involved the three people, the accused, Matthews and the unidentified male, that in such circumstances if you so find that having sexual intercourse while she was being restrained and the Crown will submit, draw an inference, that she struggled and fought back, that the accused knew she was not consenting and that it took place in the company of the persons he was with.""
THE EVIDENCE16Although it is not necessary for me to set out the entirety of the evidence adduced by the Crown, there are parts of that evidence which are particularly relevant to the present application and to which I must refer.  
The discovery of the deceased's body17At about 11.50 am on Saturday 1 February 1992 Joseph Cassidy and his then girlfriend Nicole Lamaro were on a camping trip in the Royal National Park.  Whilst Mr Cassidy was walking along what has been described as a fire trail located approximately 5 kms northwest of the township of Bundeena, he noticed what he described as the contents of a handbag, along with various other items, strewn across the ground.  Mr Cassidy gave evidence that as he walked further along the fire trail he saw what he described as ""a pair of women's panties"".  Having observed blood on a rock as he continued to walk along the trail, he saw what he described as ""drag marks"".  He followed those marks off the track into an area of bushland, and came upon the naked body of a female, later identified as the deceased.  A glass beaded necklace was around her left hand.  
18There is evidence that during the period of time leading up to her death, the deceased had worked from time to time as a prostitute.  She frequented particular areas in the Sydney CBD including a hotel in Pitt Street where she lived from time to time, as well as Greasies Café which was located near Central Railway Station.  There is also evidence that she was a drug user at the time.
19The deceased's body was lying in a position east of Bundeena Drive.  The trail along which Mr Cassidy was walking runs generally to the south east of Bundeena Drive.  Its entrance is located approximately 4 kms from the township of Bundeena.  Further south east of where the deceased was found is an area known as Marley Lagoon.  To the north west of where the deceased was found is an area known as Winifred Falls (see T 102 line 47 and Exh. H).
20At the time of making his statement to the police in 1992, Mr Cassidy said that he saw two pairs of women's pants, one in the vicinity of the items he described as coming from a handbag, and another further along the trail.  Although Mr Cassidy was present when the police later arrived, he did not direct their attention to the two sets of pants as he was no longer permitted to be within the area, it having by that time been designated as a crime scene.  
21John Rowan, who was then a Detective Senior Constable of Police attached to the Crime Scene Unit, arrived at the Royal National Park at approximately 1:30 pm on the afternoon of 1 February 1992.  Having walked for approximately 50 metres along the trail from its entrance at Bundeena Drive he observed, and later seized, a number of items, one of which he described as a ""pair of pink panties"" which are depicted in a photograph taken at the scene (Exh. D2, photograph 5).  I have noted previously that Mr Cassidy had told police he observed two pairs of women's underpants.  However, Mr Rowan photographed and seized only one pair.    
22Evidence was given by Professor Duflou (at T 531 line 47) that the deceased had died ""during the night of 31 January 1992 to 1 February 1992"".  In these circumstances, the Crown called evidence from a number of persons who had been in the Royal National Park during the previous evening.   
23Anthony Bracewell, who was camping with his then girlfriend Sally Rooney in the area of Winifred Falls, gave evidence (commencing at T 130 line 46) that he had heard a scream at around 8 pm on the evening of 31 January 1992.  At that time he was at his campsite at Winifred Falls and he described the scream as sounding like that of a male.  When asked about the direction from which the scream had come, Mr Bracewell said that it was from a direction further north of Winifred Falls.  Bearing in mind the map of the relevant part of the Royal National Park (Exh. H) Winifred Falls is several thousand metres to the north west of the area in which the deceased was found.  A scream heard from a direction further north of Winifred Falls would place it as emanating from a direction opposite to that in which the deceased's body was located.
24Ms Rooney, whose statement was read to the jury by consent (commencing at T 394 line 5), described the scream as coming from a female.  She put the time as being about 5:00pm or 6:00pm on the afternoon of 31 January 1992.
25Jason Smith gave evidence (commencing at T 429 line 1) that at about 10.00 pm on the evening of 31 January 1992 he was walking along a trail towards Marley Beach for the purposes of attending a party in that area.  He said he heard a scream which he thought was from a female and formed the impression that it came from an area he described as being ""further on down the track"" (at T 429 line 16).  The trail along which Mr Smith had been walking was 500 to 600 metres to the north east of where the deceased was found (at T 430 line 3 to line 10; Exh. V).  A scream heard from a direction further along that track would place it as emanating from the area in front of that to which he was walking.  The position in which the deceased was found was in fact behind Mr Smith at the point where he heard the scream.  
26Darren Adams, who was with Mr Smith, also gave evidence (commencing at T 119 line 5) of hearing a female scream.  He put the position at which he heard it further towards Marley Beach (i.e. further to the south east) than the position nominated by Mr Smith (Exh. E). He thought the scream had come from the opposite direction (i.e. back in the direction of the area in which the deceased's body was located) and he put the time at which he heard the scream at about midnight.  
The evidence of Professor Duflou 27Professor Johan Duflou, a Forensic Pathologist, attended the scene on 1 February 1992.  As I have already noted, he formed the view that the deceased's death had occurred ""on the night of 31 January to 1 February 1992"". There was what he described (commencing at T 531 line 45) as an ""inherent uncertainty"" in determining the time of death with any greater precision.    
28Professor Duflou conducted a post mortem examination on the following day, 2 February 1992.  He gave extensive evidence (commencing at T (commencing at T 532 line 35) of the deceased's injuries which included:
(i)a laceration to the area behind the deceased's ear which he thought was typical of a laceration caused by impact with a blunt object;
(ii)extensive abrasions and grazing of the entire forehead;
(iii)smaller abrasions on the surface of the head itself;
(iv)multiple linear abrasions or grazes over the top of the deceased's right shoulder, the back of her trunk and her hip,  consistent with the deceased having been dragged over a rough surface by the arms;
(v)a fracture to the base of the skull, consistent with an impact to the front of the deceased's head;
(vi)a fracture of the top of the skull, consistent with impact with a large heavy object; and
(vii)a fracture of the sixth left rib.
29He concluded that the direct cause of the deceased's death were the head injuries.    
30Professor Duflou agreed (commencing at T 540 line 43) that leaving aside the head injuries, the remainder of the injuries were ""relatively minor"".  He said that ""there was very little injury to indicate that a struggle had taken place"", and that ""if there was a struggle it was a minimal struggle only"".  He also agreed that the injuries found to have been sustained by the deceased (apart from the rib injury) were consistent with her having been struck with a single blow and dragged through the bush.
31Professor Duflou also gave evidence (commencing at T 541 line 30) that he found no external injury, and no injury to the deceased's vagina or anus suggestive of forced sexual intercourse having taken place.  He also said (at T 544 line 12) that he could not exclude the possibility that the deceased had died on the afternoon of 31 January 1992.  
Evidence of other items found near the scene32On the afternoon of 1 February 1992, various items were found and seized in and around the area of where the deceased's body was located.  I have already made reference to the pink underpants and it is not necessary, for present purposes, to set out the other items which were found.  It is sufficient to note that generally speaking, they were of a kind which might be found in a woman's handbag.  
33On 7 February 1992 Superintendent Tuck found a number of items of clothing on a trail located on the eastern side of Bundeena Drive.  One of those items was a white blouse (Exh. G, photograph 23 and Exh. L) which Superintendent Tuck described as ""quite transparent"" and ""quite thin"" (at T 154 line 39-40).  In a statement made at the time of finding the blouse he made no reference to it being torn or ripped (at T 155 line 8 - 15).  The photograph in Exh. G shows that the blouse was of apparently sheer material and apart from a small tear in the lower seam, it appears otherwise intact.    
34The Crown called Wayne Taylor, who was the deceased's partner in the period leading up to her death.  Having been shown a photograph of the blouse (Exh. L) Mr Taylor said (at T 231 line 33) that it was ""an item of clothing that (the deceased) would wear..."".  
Statements made by the accused35Evidence was called in the Crown case from Fiona Innis, a Psychologist employed by the Department of Corrective Services, who gave evidence (commencing at T 440 line 18) that on 3 August 2011 she spoke with the accused for the purposes of conducting a ""screening interview"" in circumstances where he had recently been taken into custody at the Bathurst Correctional Centre.  Ms Innis gave evidence (at T 441 line 15) that in the course of her interview the accused said:
""I'm going to get him.""
36When Ms Innis asked to whom he was referring, the accused said:
 ""My coee.""
37When she asked the accused how he would feel if came across his co-accused he responded:
""He would be black and blue and coming out with a third person's name"".
38The Crown also called Rodney Fagg, a Correctional Officer, who gave evidence (commencing at T 444 line 40) that whilst on duty at the Bathurst Correctional Centre in August 2011 he overheard the accused (in a telephone conversation with his partner) say words to the effect:
""I'd really like to get him really bad.""39Mr Fagg inferred that accused's reference to ""him"" was a reference to Matthews.  As a consequence, he issued an alert within the gaol system precluding any association between the accused and Matthews. 
40Further, in a conversation on 16 September 2011 (Exh. AX 1) the accused was recorded as saying:
""When the psych spoke to me, she said 'what's going to happen when you run into your coee'. Well, two things, he's gunna be black and blue and he'll be comin out with a third person's name, 'cause I ain't comin out with it...But yeah, because I said that I'd get get the third name out of him, yeah, ok, well we're not going to let you near him.""
41In another recorded conversation on 27 October 2011 (Exh. BA 1) the accused was recorded as saying:  
""'Cause like I said they still haven't found the third person which is the actual second person in the fuckin' blue.""
The toxicology evidence42William Allender, a Forensic Scientist specialising in toxicology, gave evidence (commencing at T 346 line 18) that:
(i)a blood sample taken from the deceased at the time of post mortem examination was found to contain1.0 milligrams per litre of methamphetamine and 0.15 milligrams per litre of pseudoephedrine;
(ii)a liver sample taken at the same time was found to have 0.23 milligrams per litre of methamphetamine;
(iii)a stomach sample was found to have 0.23 milligrams per litre of methamphetamine and 0.07 milligrams of pseudoephedrine; and
(iv)a urine sample was found to contain 13 milligrams per litre of methamphetamine, 7.3 milligrams per litre of pseudoephedrine, and traces of cannabinoids. 
43Mr Allender agreed when cross-examined (at T 352 line 11) that the level of methamphetamine found in the deceased's blood was a very high one.  He also agreed (at T 352 line 14-25) that methamphetamine increases aggressive and risk taking behaviours and that the therapeutic range for methamphetamine was between 0.01 and 0.05 milligrams per litre.  
The DNA evidence44The various items found in and around the area in which the deceased's body was found, along with the various swabs taken from her, were the subject of forensic testing, as were the fingernail clippings.   The evidence of the results of that testing was given by two witnesses called by the Crown, Sharon Neville and David Bruce.    
45Ms Neville gave evidence (commencing at T 569 line 15) that in February 1992 she received a number of items for analysis.  For present purposes it is relevant that Ms Neville detected:
(i)no traces of semen on the pink underpants found at the scene;
(ii)semen on a rectal swab; and
(iii)semen on a vaginal swab.  
46Ms Neville said (commencing at T 574 line 1) that in April 2006 she was provided with a buccal swab which had been obtained from Matthews, following which she conducted DNA testing on a number of items.  She gave evidence (commencing at T 574 line 35) that:
(i)mixtures of DNA originating from more than one individual were recovered from one of the rectal swabs;
(ii)Matthews had the same DNA profile as the major component of DNA in each of those mixtures;
(iii)DNA testing on the vaginal swabs was unsuccessful; and
(iv)the pink underpants found at the scene were not further examined at that time.
47Ms Neville explained (at T 576 line 27- T 577 line 4) that the fact that no semen was detected on the pink underpants did not exclude its possible presence.  She also gave evidence (commencing at T 577 line 39) concerning the examination of the white blouse found by Superintendent Tuck on 7 February 1992.  She agreed that the only reference in her notes to any damage to that item was to a tear in the lower right hand seam.  She also confirmed (at T 579 line 29 - 31) that there was nothing contained in the description of that item recorded at the time which suggested any further physical damage to it.    
48Mr Bruce, an analyst from the New South Wales Forensic and Analytical Science Service, gave evidence of the results of DNA testing which he carried out on various items.   To the extent which is relevant for present purposes, his evidence (commencing at T 599 line 7) may be summarised as follows:  
(i)DNA testing on the pink underpants was unsuccessful; 
(ii)DNA testing on a rectal swab collected at the crime scene disclosed a mixture originating from three individuals. Of those three individuals, the DNA matched the profile of Matthews, a component of the mixture matched the accused and another component of the mixture matched that of an unknown male individual;
(iii)DNA testing of the vaginal swab disclosed a profile consistent with that of Matthews; 
(iv)DNA testing of a rectal swab collected at the time of post mortem disclosed a mixture of DNA originating from three individuals, Matthews being a major contributor, and each of the unknown male and the accused being minor contributors;
(v)further DNA testing on the rectal swab in (iv) confirmed that the DNA recovered matched the profiles of the accused, Matthews and the unknown male;
(vi)DNA testing of a number of fingernail clippings taken at the time of post-mortem recovered a mixture from at least three male individuals, one of whom was the accused; 
(vii)DNA testing of parts of a long length of beads found on the deceased recovered a mixture of at least three male individuals consistent with Matthews, the accused and the unknown male;
(viii)DNA testing of the right front breast of the deceased recovered a partial DNA profile which matched that of the accused.
49Mr Bruce confirmed (commencing at T 622 line 45) that the conclusion from the screening test conducted on the pink underpants in 1992 was that no semen was detected.  He said that he undertook a further test of that item in 2011 and said (commencing at T 637 line 5) that the conclusion from that test was that there were faint fluorescent stains detected which were consistent with semen.  When it was suggested to him (at T 638 line 32) that he could not rule out the possibility that there was semen on the underpants he answered:   
""That would not be consistent with the original screening test for semen that was done on the panties in 1992.  I, from my testing cannot rule out the presence of semen, but the previous testing has said that it was negative and therefore they didn't detect semen on the panties. "" 50In addition to his evidence of DNA testing, Mr Bruce told the court that he had also been asked to express an opinion about the period which was likely to have elapsed between the time at which sexual intercourse had taken place, and the time of the deceased's death.  In this regard he said (commencing at T 624 line 26):
""The estimation of time since intercourse involves looking at data on how many spermatozoa on visible on slides made from samples taken from that area. Basically the more spermatozoa that are present the shorter the time since intercourse interval would be.  
The other indicator when complete spermatozoa are seen and what I mean by that spermatozoa with tails that also is an indicator that the semen has been deposited more recently. Again this is an estimation.  
The main factors involved with the removal of semen deposited in the anal cavity would be biological functions such as defecation, degradation of the sperm.  It's an area where the bowel area has cellular material that actually removes foreign material from that area.  And the other thing is just drainage by gravity and by activity of the person. So those factors 
Q.  just activity, can that include walking around in your daily life? A.  Yes, that's correct, yes.  So from that information and also from information that was available in the literature with regard to time since intercourse and since anal intercourse, and also after looking at a considerable number of cases from our own laboratory and what sort of results we obtained, I came to the opinion that the time since intercourse would certainly have been within a 48 hour period as a conservative estimate and most likely within a 24hour period. "" 
51Mr Bruce then said, in clarification of his earlier evidence (commencing at T 625 line 35):
""I think I may have confused the issue inadvertently.  What we're looking for, the time since intercourse interval applies to the interval between the deposition of the semen and death in this particular, in these types of instances and not deposition of semen in collection of the samples, which occurred, would have occurred after death.  Sorry just to 
Q.  So when you give a 48 and 24 hours period, are you saying the deposition is almost certainly within a 48-hour period of death? A.  That's correct. 
Q.  Is that what you are saying, and most likely within a 24 hour period of death? A.  That's correct, based on the information that we had from the slides and also from information from peer review journals and also from our laboratory."" The evidence of the accused's appearance52Exh. AG 2 is a photograph of the accused tendered by the Crown.  It was taken on 27 December 1991 (T 593 line 8 - 10), that is a little less than one month before the deceased's murder.  
53Exh. AG 1 is another photograph of the accused which was taken on 13 March 1992 (T 592 line 48 - 50), approximately 6 weeks after the deceased's murder, and at a time when the accused was with Matthews and another person in Queensland.
54Other than the fact that the accused has his eyes closed in Exh. AG 1, his facial appearance is otherwise identical to that in Exh. AG 2.  The only real difference in his appearance is that his hair in Exh. AG 1 is obviously shorter than it was in the other photograph taken some months before.    
Statements of the accused said to be lies55The Crown asserts that a number of statements made by the accused when interviewed by police are capable of being construed as lies which amount to evidence of a consciousness of guilt.  The Crown relies upon this evidence as part of its circumstantial case against the accused.  
Statements in the first interview56The first occasion on which the accused was interviewed by the police was on 10 August 2009.  
57In the course of that interview, he was shown a photograph of the deceased and at Q177 - Q181 the following is recorded:
Q177 No, unfortunately, that's the best image I could find. A This is a bit harder, 'cause there weren't too many girls.
Q178 I don't think this person stayed at Foster House, 'cause there weren't women that stayed there, that was a men's refuge. A Yeah, no, yeah
 Q179 But I believe -- A But there were sheilas friends down there. Q180 But I believe she may have attended Greasies Café fairly regularly and was around that area at the time.A Maybe, 'cause there was a couple of sheilas there at Greasies. Mark went out with one of them, Zimbabwean Mark.
Q181 Does that face look familiar at all?A I'm trying to think.  Maybe, I'm not sure.  'Cause like I said before, I can't even think of that guy that I bought that Valiant off down there.  But I can't remember him, do you know what I mean?
58Subsequently, reference was  made to  Wayne Taylor, the deceased's boyfriend, and the following ensued:
Q300 And both he and Pia Navida regularly frequented Greasies Café.A Mmm, so I probably sold to them or I would have seen them if they were there.
 Q301   Yeah, but you weren't quite sure whether you recognised Pia?A Yeah, I'm not positive if I recognised her face or not.  I don't know, I've seen a couple of heads like that up around The Cross and that, so I'm not sure if it's the same one.
Statements in the second interview59The second occasion on which the accused was interviewed by the police was on 2 August 2011.    
60The questions asked included the following:  
Q274 (Shown photo of Pia Navida) Do you recognise the person within this photograph?A Not off hand, but from what the ... was, that's the girl that was killed. .... Q279 Have you seen this person before?A I can't say I have.  I, I don't know.  I can't say whether I have or I haven't. ...  Q284 What does that mean?A Well if she was anywhere down near Foster House or Greasies then, yeah, more than likely I would have seen her. Q285 What makes you say that? A Because I was always there. ...Q394 OK, can you explain to me how your DNA came to be on Pia Navida's body? A No. Oh, no.
 Q395 Now the DNA --A Like I said, not unless I met her down there near Greasies.  I don't know.
 Q396 OK. A Other than that, no.
Q397 All right.  Now the DNA that I'm talking about was located under one of her fingernails.  Can you explain to me how your DNA would come to be under her fingernail? A Not really, no, no.  Sorry, I can't. ...Q418 Is there any reason why your DNA would be in Pia Navida's rectal cavity? A Not that I know of, no. ...Q 488 I'll show you another photograph.  The photograph that I am showing you, do you recognise the tattoo that's depicted in that photograph? A No, no.
Q489 No.  I'll tell you, that that photo, that, that tattoo was on the right shoulder of Pia Navida's right shoulder.  Is there anything you can tell me about that? A Not offhand.
 Q490 Are you happy to sign that photograph?A No.  Like I said before, the only way I would have known her would have been through Greasies, selling the gear.  Other than that, no.    Q491 I'll show you another photograph depicting tattoos. A Yeah.  Q492 Is there anything that you can tell me about these tattoos? A No. 
 Q493 Have you ever seen those tattoos before? A No.  Not that I remember, no. 
61On 17 January 2012, a conversation between the accused and his partner was recorded (Exh. BB 1) in the course of which the following was said:  
""KT How long were you with her?ACC Over about six weeks.  She kept comin' around to the corner when I was drinkin' with Lucy and that, I met her through Tracey, that other broad.  Probably I slept with her probably 10 times over a six week period"".
62In a conversation which took place the following day, 18 January 2012, the accused was recorded as saying (Exh. BC 1): 
"".... I mean the only thing that looks bad Kell is I didn't say nothin' to the coppers about being with her, do you know what I mean, but at that stage I didn't really wanna bring myself into it. ...""
63The accused then said:""Well, fuck that, it was a 50/50 chance if me fuckin' DNA was gunna come up or not.  Whether or not it was the same day that I was last with her or not, but now I'm thinkin' that fuckin' like, I've been trying to think for the last, like, couple of months but I'm thinkin', yeah, it's the last time I was with her when I left her asleep in the back of the panel van"".
64The Crown asserts that the various statements made by the accused to the police when interviewed regarding (inter alia) his lack of knowledge of the deceased are, in light of his subsequent statements when speaking with his partner, lies which evidence a consciousness of guilt.  
THE ELEMENTS OF THE OFFENCES65The elements of the offence of murder are as follows:
(a)that the deceased died on or about 1 February 1992 at Bundeena in the State of New South Wales;
(b)that the accused did an act causing the death of the deceased; and
(c)that the act of the accused causing the death of the deceased was done by the accused either:
(i)with the intent to kill the deceased; or
(ii)with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.  
66The elements of the alternative offence of manslaughter are as follows:
(a)that the deceased died on or about 1 February 1992 at Bundeena in the State of New South Wales;
(b)that the accused did an act causing the death of the deceased; 
(c)that the act of the accused causing the death of the deceased was both unlawful and dangerous.
67The elements of the offence aggravated sexual assault are as follows:
(a)that the accused had sexual intercourse with the deceased on or about 1 February 1992 at Bundeena in the State of New South Wales;
(b)that the accused had such sexual intercourse with the deceased without her consent; and
(c)that the accused knew at the time the sexual intercourse took place that the accused did not consent; and
(d)that the accused was in the company of Matthews at the time.
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES68Senior counsel for the accused commenced his submissions by making reference to the terms of the Crown Prosecutor's opening address to the jury.  He emphasised that the Crown had asserted that the accused was present at the Royal National Park at the time of the deceased's death and that he was a participant in the physical attack upon the deceased, either by striking her or by restraining her whilst some other person(s) struck her.  Against that background, senior counsel put the present application on two bases, namely:(i)that the evidence was incapable of placing the accused at the Royal National Park at the relevant time; 
(ii)that, in any event, there was no evidence capable of satisfying the jury, either that it was an act of the accused which caused the death of the deceased (count 1) or that he had engaged in forced sexual intercourse in company (count 2).   
69As to the first basis, senior counsel submitted that taken at its highest, the evidence established nothing more than the fact that the accused had engaged in sexual intercourse with the deceased at some time during the 48 hour period prior to her death.  This, he submitted, was not sufficient to place the accused at the scene of the murder at the relevant time.  
70As to the second basis, senior counsel submitted that even if I were to come to the view that the evidence was capable of establishing that the accused was present at the Royal National Park at the material time, there was no evidence which was capable of establishing one or more of the remaining elements of each offence.  
71As to the count of murder, senior counsel accepted that there was obviously evidence which was capable of satisfying the jury that the deceased had been killed as a consequence of being struck with the rock which was found near her body.  However, he submitted that there was simply no evidence at all which was capable of supporting a conclusion that it was the act of the accused which caused the deceased's death, in either of the ways outlined by the Crown Prosecutor in his opening.
72As to count 2, and although he accepted that there was evidence that sexual intercourse had taken place between the accused and the deceased at some point in the 48 hour period leading up to the deceased's death, senior counsel for the accused submitted that there was no evidence capable of establishing that such sexual intercourse took place:
(i)without the consent of the deceased; or(ii)in company.
73As to the first of those matters, and in circumstances where the Crown case was opened on the basis that the deceased had not consented to the sexual intercourse, and had struggled with and fought off her attackers, senior counsel placed particular reliance upon the evidence of Professor Duflou.  He submitted that there was an absence of any objective evidence which was consistent with any struggle having occurred.  
74As to the second of those matters, senior counsel submitted that the evidence was capable of establishing nothing more than the fact that sexual intercourse had taken place between the deceased and three different males at some point in time.  There was, he submitted, no evidence at all which was capable of establishing that it was committed in company.
75As to the Crown's use of lies, senior counsel for the accused stressed the necessity for a cautious approach to be taken to that issue.  In short, he submitted that a proper analysis of the statements made by the accused supported the conclusion that the relevant test was not met.    
76Having stressed the need to consider the evidence as a whole, the Crown Prosecutor set out a number of circumstances upon which he relied to sustain the inferences necessary to establish the elements of each offence.  These included the following:  
(i)the deceased was found in a remote location, concealed from the roadway;
(ii)the location was a significant distance from the area in which the deceased lived and which she frequented;
(iii)the location was also a significant distance from the area in which the accused lived and frequented;
(iv)the deceased's body was entirely naked when discovered;
(v)there were personal items nearby (including the pink underpants) which the jury could infer were those of the deceased;
(vi)when tested, there were no traces of semen on the pink underpants;
(vii)people in the vicinity heard screaming;
(viii)the accused changed his appearance, as demonstrated by a comparison of Exhs. AG 1 and AG 2;
(ix)the accused was seen with Matthews and another person in Queensland six weeks after the death of the deceased.
77The Crown described the reference by senior counsel for the accused upon the evidence of Professor Duflou as ""a fair submission"".  However, he pointed to the evidence of the deceased's broken rib, and the presence of the accused's DNA on her fingernails, as evidence from which a struggle could be inferred, and a conclusion reached that there had been a lack of consent to the sexual intercourse on the part of the deceased.  
78The Crown also relied upon the accused's references to a ""third person"" in his conversation with Ms Innis and in the conversation overheard by Mr Fagg, as well as similar references in the two later recorded conversations.  He submitted that this evidence was capable of sustaining an inference of knowledge on the part of the accused of the circumstances surrounding the deceased's death.
79Finally, the Crown relied, as part of its overall circumstantial case against the accused, upon the statements to which I have previously referred as constituting lies.  It was submitted that one or more of those statements met the requirements of a lie which amounted to evidence of a consciousness of guilt.  
CONSIDERATION The test to be applied in determining the application80It is open to me to direct a verdict of not guilty only if I come to the conclusion that there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, the evidence will not support a verdict of guilty.  In Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207 the High Court stated the principle in this way (at 214):
""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations, and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at it s highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.""
81It will be evident from the matters to which I have already referred that the Crown case against the accused is a circumstantial one.  However the fact that at this stage of the proceedings there may be competing hypotheses or inferences available does not mean that I should direct a verdict of not guilty.  It is not open to me to direct a verdict of not guilty on the basis that inferences other than those advanced by the Crown might be open:  R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.  In Saffron v Director of Public Prosecutions; Allen v Director of Public Prosecutions (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 Gleeson CJ explained the matter in this way (at 401):
""It is a corollary of the fundamental principle that the prosecution carries the onus of proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that a jury cannot convict on the basis of circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances: Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 and Chamberlain v The Queen [No 2] (1984) 153 CLR 521. It does not follow, however, that simply because it is possible, looking at the objective circumstances established by the evidence in a case, to construct a hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused, the case is not one fit to go to a jury. That entirely overlooks the role of the jury in a criminal trial.""
82His Honour observed that the various matters to which he had referred had been emphasised in Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1983] 2 VR 410 where the Court (Young CJ, Anderson and Gobbo JJ) said (at 415-416):
""The question whether the Crown has ultimately excluded every reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence is a question of fact for the jury and therefore, if the Crown has led evidence upon which the accused could be convicted a trial judge should not rule that there is no case to answer or direct the jury to acquit simply because he thinks that there could be formulated a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence of the accused which the Crown has failed to exclude. Similarly a trial judge should not rule that there is no case for the accused to answer because he has formed the view that, if the decision on the facts were his and not the jury's, he would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. It is always a question for the jury whether a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of the accused and as Menzies J explained in Plomp's Case, in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the necessity to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence is no more than an application to that class of case of the requirement that the case be proved beyond reasonable doubt"" (emphasis in original).
83It follows that if the evidence adduced by the Crown is capable of proving each of the elements of each offence beyond reasonable doubt, then the matter should be left to the jury for determination (see R v Bilick and Starke (1984) 36 SASR 321; 11 A Crim R 452).  In determining the present application, it is important to consider the evidence as a whole, and not in a piecemeal way (see R v Hillier (2007) 228 CLR 618).  
The issue of lies84Although the evidence must be considered as a whole the Crown relies, as part of its circumstantial case, upon statements made by the accused which are said to amount to lies which constitute evidence of a consciousness of guilt.  In that sense, the issue of whether or not statements made by the accused should be so regarded is a discreet one. 
85In short, the Crown argues that the statements made by the accused in his interviews to the police, in which he effectively denied knowledge of the deceased, should, in light of his subsequent statements when speaking to his partner, be regarded as lies.  The Crown submitted that those statements met the relevant test so as to permit them to be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused.
86The general principles concerning the use of lies which were formulated in Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 and Zoneff v R (2000) 200 CLR 234 were conveniently summarised by Whealy J (as his Honour then was) in R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 672 at [24] and following, and again in R v Lane (No. 13) [2010] NSWSC 1540.  The latter decision was the subject of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal (see R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157) and although the Court found error in Whealy J's application of the relevant principles, I do not understand the members of the Court to have found error in his Honour's statements of the principles themselves.  The most fundamental of those principles is that order to be permitted to be used for the purposes of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, statement(s) relied upon by the Crown as constituting lie(s) must:
(a)be deliberately false;(b)relate to a material issue; and (c)be motivated by a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth.
87The Crown properly pointed out that although some of the authorities speak of a need for caution to be adopted where lies are sought to be relied upon as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, that does not mean that such caution should be adopted in a way which inhibits the Crown from having the benefit of such evidence when that is clearly appropriate (see R v Lane [2011] NSWCCA 157 at [26] per McClellan CJ at CL).  Whether it is clearly appropriate in the present case is the question.  That question is to be determined according to whether the statements relied upon by the Crown as constituting lies are capable of meeting the three elements of the test set out  in [86] above.    
88In the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Lane (supra) Simpson J observed (at [60]) that the task of a trial judge in determining whether evidence of lies may be used in the way for which the Crown contends in the present case is to determine whether or not the evidence is capable of meeting the test I have set out.  If the evidence is so capable, then the Crown should be permitted to rely upon this evidence as part of its overall circumstantial case.  Consistent with those authorities which govern the test that I am required to apply in determining the present application (set out at [80] to [83] above) the fact that there may be inferences available to be drawn from the statements of the accused other than those urged by the Crown does not mean that it is not open to the jury to conclude that one or more of those statements amounts to a lie which is evidence of a consciousness of guilt (see R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234 at 244 per Clarke JA (with whom Gleeson CJ and Studdert J agreed).  
89Some of the statements made by the accused in his two interviews, and which are relied upon by the Crown as constituting lies, are somewhat vague and equivocal.  For example, and bearing in mind that the necessity for any asserted lie to be clearly identified (see Edwards (supra) at 210) I have some doubts about whether anything said by the accused in the first of his interviews amounts to a lie.  It is relevant in this regard to note that on that occasion the accused was being asked to recall events which had taken place some 17years earlier.    
90However, in light of the statements made by the accused to his partner in the conversation recorded in Exhs. BB 1 and BC 1, I am satisfied that his answers to questions 279, 394, 397 and 418 in the second of his interviews would be capable of being regarded as being deliberately false.  Accordingly, the first element of the test is met.  
91Further, the statements made by the accused in answer to those questions related to his knowledge of, and contact with, the deceased.  That is obviously a material issue.  It follows that the second requirement is also met.  
92The real issue is whether it would be open to the jury to rationally infer that it was a consciousness of guilt which motivated the accused to make the statements in question.  In the conversations with his partner, the accused was recorded as saying, in effect, that he did not tell the police about being with the deceased because (as he put it) ""he did not want to bring (himself) into it"".  Properly viewed, this is not a case of the accused simply omitting to tell the police about being with the deceased.  If it were simply an omission, it would be not be a lie.  It is more a case of (for example) the accused being asked whether he had ever seen the deceased before, and the accused responding by saying that he had not.  
93In my view, it is important to bear in mind the nature of the third element of the test.  In order to be categorised as a lie in the way argued by the Crown, there must (as explained by the majority of the High Court in Edwards (supra) at 211), be an available inference that the lie was told:
""...... because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence or, as was said in Reg. v Lucas (Ruth) because of ""a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth"" (my emphasis)  94It has been recognised that because a person may lie for a variety of reasons, there may be cases where it is impossible to infer a consciousness of guilt from the nature of a lie, or the circumstances in which it occurred (see Heyde (supra) at 242 per Clarke JA).  In the present case, it is relevant that the statement(s) in the second interview which are relied upon by the Crown as lies were made some 19 years after the relevant events took place.  It is evident from the passage of the conversation of 18 January 2012 (at [63] above) that the substantial period of time which had elapsed since the death of the deceased was causing him to attempt to piece relevant occurrences together, long after the event.  Whilst it may be that he answered questions put by the police because he did not wish to connect himself with the events surrounding the deceased's death that does not, without more, lead to the conclusion that his motivation for making such statements was a realisation of guilt of either of the offences with which he has been charged.  Indeed, there were statements made by the accused, both in the course of his second interview with the police and in the two conversations with his partner, which were at odds with such a realisation.  
95For these reasons, I have come to the view that the final element of the relevant test for lies has not been met.  The Crown should not be permitted to rely on those statements as evidence of a consciousness of guilt on the part of the accused, as part of its overall circumstantial case.     
The first basis of the application96As I have noted, the first submission made on behalf of the accused was that the evidence taken at its highest establishes nothing more than the fact that the accused had sexual intercourse with the deceased between within 48 hours of her death.      
97I have made a number of references to the finding of the pink underpants.  In my view, the location at which they were found, and the presence of other items in that general vicinity, would be capable of sustaining an inference that the underpants belonged to the deceased.    
98Mr Stratton SC emphasised that the absence of any DNA (including the DNA of the deceased) on the underpants was capable of sustaining an inference that they in fact did not belong to the deceased.  In this regard, he placed some emphasis on the fact that Mr Cassidy had told police that he had seen two pairs of underpants at the scene.  In the absence of a second pair being seized by police, Mr Stratton submitted that it would be open to the jury to infer that those which were seized and tested were, as he described them, a ""spare pair"" which had not been worn by the deceased around the time that intercourse had taken place.  
99The absence of any DNA on the underpants which were found is certainly curious.  Moreover, I accept that the evidence of Mr Cassidy may raise a question of the presence of a second pair of underpants at the scene.  However, Mr Stratton's submissions really amount to the proposition that the evidence may sustain inferences other than those advanced by the Crown.  As I have pointed out, the relevant enquiry at this stage of the proceedings is whether or not the evidence is capable of establishing a particular fact or element.  The existence of competing inferences does not mean that the evidence is incapable of establishing a particular fact.    
100Accepting that it would be open to the jury to infer that the pink underpants were those of the deceased, and notwithstanding his reference to the presence of fluorescent staining being consistent with the presence of semen, the evidence of Mr Bruce, as well as that of Ms Neville, is capable of supporting a conclusion that no semen was detected on them.  Mr Bruce also gave evidence of the methods by which semen may drain from the anal cavity after being deposited.  Although he described biological functions as being ""the main factors"" contributing to such drainage, he pointed out that drainage may result from something as simple as the person standing up and moving around.  
101Further, although I have not specifically referred to it in my summary of the evidence, there is some evidence which connects the accused to an HQ model Holden motor vehicle.  Tyre marks found the scene match those of the tyres fitted to that model vehicle.  
102In my view, these circumstances combined are capable of supporting a conclusion that the underpants found at the scene were those of the deceased and that they had not been worn by her after any sexual intercourse had taken place.  Bearing in mind the evidence of Mr Bruce that intercourse was likely to have taken place within a 48 hour period prior to the deceased's death, the evidence is at least capable of establishing that the accused had intercourse with the deceased at the Royal National Park.  
103It follows that I am unable to accept the first of the submissions made by senior counsel for the accused.  
The second basis of the applicationCount 1104The evidence led by the Crown is obviously capable of establishing that the deceased was killed as the result of being struck to the head with a rock which was found nearby.  The more pressing question is whether the evidence, taken at its highest, establishes that it was the act of the accused which caused the deceased's death.
105I accept that a number of the matters relied upon by the Crown, including the remoteness of the location at which the deceased was found, its distance from the area in which the deceased resided, and the evidence of the tyre marks, would be capable of establishing that the accused travelled to the Royal National Park with the deceased.  However, although that evidence is capable of placing the accused at the scene at the relevant time, it says nothing at all about his participation in the act which caused the deceased's death.  Presence at the scene does not sustain an inference of participation in the killing of the deceased.  
106For the reasons more fully set out below, I am not satisfied that the evidence is capable of supporting a conclusion that a struggle took place in the way outlined by the Crown in his opening address.  Further, in light of the cause of the deceased's death, the fact more than one person may have heard a scream is unremarkable.  That fact says nothing about the accused's participation in the deceased's death and in my view it takes the matter no further.  
107I have had regard to the Crown's reliance upon the statements made by the accused in which he made reference to a ""third person"".  I accept that such evidence may sustain an inference that the accused had some knowledge of the deceased's death.  Along with the other evidence relied upon by the Crown, it may further sustain an inference that the accused was present at the time of the deceased's murder.  However, as I have already pointed out, knowledge and presence on the part of the accused does not, even in combination with the other matters relied upon by the Crown, sustain an inference of participation in either of the ways in which the Crown opened the case to the jury.  
108Further in my view, the fact that there is evidence that the accused travelled to Queensland with Matthews some six weeks after the deceased's death amounts to little.  It may demonstrate some association with Matthews but there is already evidence which places the accused and Matthews at the scene of the deceased's murder.  The fact that they may have been associating six weeks later says nothing about the act causing the deceased's death.  The evidence of the photographs of the accused, and what was said to be a change in his appearance, falls into the same category.  I have already observed that the only real difference between the two photographs of the accused is the length of his hair.  That does not, even in combination with the other circumstances relied upon by the Crown, advance the case against the accused in terms of his participation in the act which caused the deceased's death.  
109For these reasons, I have come to the view that the evidence relied upon by the Crown is incapable of establishing that it was an act of the accused which caused the deceased's death.  
Count 2110In terms of count 2, the first issue is whether the evidence is capable of establishing that the sexual intercourse which took place between the accused and the deceased was without the deceased's consent.  As I have previously outlined, it is the Crown case that such lack of consent is to be inferred from the fact that a struggle is said to have taken place.  In this regard, the Crown relied upon two particular circumstances.  The first was that the deceased sustained a broken rib.  The second was that the accused's DNA was found to be present on the deceased's fingernails.  on her fingernails.  
111The Crown opened his case to the jury on the basis that the deceased struggled with her attackers and fought back.  A struggle of the nature of that alleged by the Crown could not be properly described as minor.  However, Professor Duflou gave evidence that even taking into account the rib injury, there was very little to indicate that a struggle had taken place.  He specifically agreed (commencing at T 542 line 13) that he was conscious of the possibility of a sexual assault having taken place and was therefore specifically looking for any signs of forced intercourse when carrying out the post mortem examination.  He found no injuries suggestive of forced intercourse, nor any external injury (such as bruising) consistent with any struggle having taken place.  
112I have also had regard to the evidence of the blouse found in the vicinity.  There is, as I have pointed out, evidence from which it is open to infer that this item of clothing belonged to the deceased.  There is nothing about its appearance which is consistent of a struggle having taken place.  Further, there is also nothing about the appearance of the pink underpants suggestive of a struggle.
113Viewing the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that the existence of a broken rib, and the presence of the accused's DNA on the deceased's fingernails, in combination with the other matters relied upon by the Crown, sustain an inference that a struggle took place.  As this was the basis on which the Crown sought to establish a lack of consent, I am not satisfied that the evidence is capable of proving that element of count 2.
114In these circumstances, it is not necessary for me to consider the further question of whether or not there is sufficient evidence to establish the circumstance of aggravation alleged by the Crown.
 CONCLUSION
115For these reasons I have come to the view that the application made on behalf of the accused should succeed.  
116I propose to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty in respect of both counts in the Indictment, along with the statutory alternatives to counts 1 and 2.

		03 March 2014",2014-03-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763362,AB v R [2014] NSWCCA 31,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  This was an application for leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Arnott SC in the District Court at Sydney on 10 October 2012.  At the conclusion of the hearing of the application on 4 March 2014, the Court made an order refusing leave.  The following are my reasons for joining in the making of that order.
3The applicant, who is referred to by pseudonym because identifying him would lead to identification of his victims (s 578A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), pleaded guilty to a variety of sexual assault and child pornography offences.  The table below sets out the details of the offences and the individual sentences that the judge said that he would have imposed if he had not fixed a single aggregate sentence.
4There were 15 offences.  They involved Sexual intercourse with a person under 10; Aggravated indecent assault; Aggravated incitement of a person under 16 to commit an act of indecency; Committing an act of indecency with a person under 16; Incest; and Possession of child pornography.
5AB asked that when he was sentenced for two of those offences his guilt in respect of a further 12 offences listed on Form 1 documents be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  They involved further offences of Incest, Possession of child pornography and an offence of Committing an act of indecency with a person aged 16 or over.
6The victims of the sexual assault offences were the applicant's daughters, friends of his daughters, and his wife.  The incest offences concerned one of his daughters when she was an adult.  The applicant was found to be in possession of a vast quantity of child pornographic material when he was arrested, involving his children, their friends and many other victims.
7The aggregate sentence was one of 17 years with a non-parole period of 14 years.  It was backdated to the applicant's arrest on 18 June 2010.
Offences and sentences
OffenceMaximum penaltyCharge reference and committal or Form 1Indicative penaltyIncite person under 16 (namely 7) to commit act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation (under authority):  s 61O(1)5 yearsSeq 12Committal18 months fixed termBetween 1 January 1992 and 1 December 1992 the applicant incited EC who was then aged 7 to commit acts of indecency with his daughters CB and GB.  He encouraged EC and CB to run naked through the house on a rural property near Burke whilst he filmed the incident.  He also gave EC and his two daughters a video camera and a typed list of ""tasks"" to complete on film.  Such tasks included dancing naked, doing a strip tease, touching themselves and one another on the breast and vaginas, filming their breasts, vaginas and bottoms close-up, and various other sexual acts including two of the girls inserting a pen into their vagina.  The applicant filmed these activities and later inserted captions of a depraved nature. He was found to be in possession of the footage when arrested in 2010.
(Given the victim was aged under 10 at the time, the offence could have been charged under s 61O(2) where the maximum penalty is 7 years).Sexual intercourse with person under 10 (namely 6): s 66A(1)20 yearsSeq 10Committal7 years with non-parole period 4 yearsBetween 1 March and 30 April 1993 at the family home at Tamarama, and when his wife was in hospital, the applicant got into the bed of his 6 year-old daughter, GB, rubbed his penis around her vagina and pushed it in a little way in.  She cried and he stopped after a few minutes.  Another daughter, CB, was in another bed in the room.  He was drunk at the time.  When GB was about 13 years old she told her mother.Indecent assault in circumstances of aggravation (victim under the age of 16 (namely 14)):  s 61M(1)7 yearsSeq 30Committal12 months fixed termBetween Christmas 1998 and 31 January 1999 at EC's family home at Coogee, the applicant entered her bedroom, where CB and GB also slept.  He tickled EC's leg, and then stroked her breast on the outside of her singlet top.  When she rolled over pretending to be asleep he tickled her bottom.Incite person under 16 (namely 15) to commit act of indecency in circumstances of aggravation (under authority): s61O(1)5 yearsSeq 14Committal12 months fixed termBetween 1 January and 31 December 1999 at the family property at Alpine in the Southern Highlands, the applicant incited EC, then aged 15, to commit an act of indecency with his daughters CB and GB.  This was achieved with the promise of a horse.  Whilst being filmed by the daughters, EC did a strip tease, danced naked, wiggled her breasts and bottom, ""humped"" the floor, stroked her vagina with her finger, and parted the lips of her vagina.  When the police discovered the film, it had text at the end of it referring to ""this hot movie is brought to you by E"", and other comments.Indecent assault in circumstances of aggravation (victim under age of 16, namely 10):  s 61M(1)7 yearsSNPP 5 yearsSeq 31Committal9 months fixed termHM was a friend of the applicant's youngest daughter, LB, and used to sleep over at their Alpine home on many occasions.  On an occasion in September/October 2003, whilst filming the two girls dancing, the applicant pulled up HM's top to reveal her breasts.  HM was 10 years old.Commit act of indecency upon person under 16 (namely 10 years) (x 2): s 61N(1)2 yearsSeq 32 & 33Committal6 months fixed termIn September/October 2003, the applicant covertly video-taped HM and LB (both aged 10) showering naked and dressing.Incest with person 16 or over: s 78A(1)8 yearsSeq 20Committal4 years fixed termIncest with person 16 or over (x 4): s 78A(1)Seq 19, 21, 25 & 26

Between 18 March and 3 May 2010, he engaged in various sexual activities with her.  Most were identified as having occurred in the home.  All were video-taped and involved sexual ""role-plays"" where CB is, for example, dressed in a skimpy dress and black stockings, or on a leash.
Sequence 20 involved CB being dressed in a skimpy outfit and black stockings.  She had penile/vaginal intercourse with the applicant who lay naked on a bed.  They also engaged in acts of cunnilingus and fellatio.  Sequences 22, 23 and 24 involved CB role-playing a school friend or being on a leash before performing fellatio.Possess child pornography (x 4): s 91H(2)10 yearsSeq 2, 4, 28 and 29Committal6 months fixed terms for seq 2 and 4.  4 years 6 months fixed terms for seq 28 and 29.Possess child pornography (x 7): s 91H(2)

Seq 18
Form 1 (taken into account re Seq 28)The child pornography offences came to light on 17 June 2010 when the applicant and CB had an argument.  She rang her mother who, worried about the hysteria she heard and for her daughter's safety, rang the police.  When the police arrived, CB told them that the applicant had child pornography in a storage unit at Campbelltown.  Police were there to find hundreds of DVDs and CDs and 8 home videos.  They also seized computer equipment from his home and, apart from discovering the movies of the applicant engaging in incest with CB, they also discovered child pornography.  More will be said about the nature of this pornography later.
The Form 1 offence of committing an act of indecency occurred in 2003 and involved the applicant filming his wife naked and showering without her knowledge or consent.
Some sentencing errors
8This was a particularly complicated sentencing exercise given the number and gravity of the charges and the historical nature of some of them.  It required close attention to the correct maximum penalties that applied at the time the offences were committed.  It was almost inevitable that technical errors would creep in.  
9The judge assessed an indicative sentence for an offence (sequence 31) by way of fixed term when that offence carried a standard non-parole period.  For such an offence, s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a judge imposing an aggregate sentence to indicate not only the sentence that would have been imposed but also the non-parole period.
10Another matter was that the judge specified commencement dates for each of the indicative sentences.  This was unnecessary and it is contrary to the benefits conferred by the relatively recent amendments to the sentencing legislation that now permits aggregate sentencing.  As it turns out, there was a gap between the expiry of some sentences and the commencement of the next sentence but that is immaterial.  The dates the judge specified can be ignored because they are otiose.
Matters personal to the offender
11The judge noted that the applicant was born in 1955 and was about 37 years of age when the first offence occurred.  He was 57 at the time of sentencing.
12His criminal history involved driving offences which were of no relevance.  But in 2001 he was convicted for two offences of possessing child pornography and received a three-year good behaviour bond.  It was an aggravating feature of the offences identified as sequence 31 (Aggravated indecent assault) and sequences 32 and 33 (Committing an act of indecency) that he was subject to that bond at the time they occurred.
13The applicant was married in 1980, divorced in 2008 and had three daughters.
14There was evidence to the effect that the applicant claimed that his offending was partly due to his escaping from a ""loveless marriage which ultimately led to him losing touch with reality"".  
15A forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, considered that the applicant's intelligence was in the higher part of the normal range.  He had left school at the end of Year 10.  He gained employment in information technology with Qantas and various other employers until the time of his arrest. 
16There was evidence that the applicant had been using methamphetamine (""ice"") for about six months prior to his arrest.  
17A 25 per cent reduction of sentence was allowed to the applicant on account of the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty.  The pleas were entered in the Local Court on 23 April 2012, almost two years after his arrest on 18 June 2010.  There had been an indication at an earlier time that he would plead guilty but the entry of pleas was delayed because he had become mentally unwell and a question of his competence arose.
18The judge noted that the applicant had a psychotic illness but that Dr Nielssen had said it was atypical in that it was relatively late in onset and quite responsive to treatment.  The doctor considered that it may have been triggered by the abuse of methamphetamine prior to arrest.  The applicant was thought to be moderately depressed when seen by Dr Nielssen in March 2012.  
19The judge was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there was a causal connection between the offending and this late onset mental illness.  He did not consider that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced, or that less weight should be given to general deterrence.  He did, however, accept that it was appropriate to reduce the sentence to be imposed by ""a moderate degree"" on account of hardship the applicant might experience in custody on account of his mental state. (His Honour was obviously mindful of the ways a mental condition may be potentially relevant to sentence: see the principles summarised in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 (McClellan CJ at CL)). 
20The applicant had a disorder of abnormal sexual interest in underage females and women involved in sexual acts with animals according to Dr Nielssen.  He also considered that the applicant had an alcohol abuse disorder.  
21The applicant told Dr Nielssen that he had an interest in pornographic magazines and X-rated videos but ""drifted into child pornography on the internet from about 1999"".  He became a compulsive collector.
22The learned judge rejected a suggestion in the applicant's claim to the arresting police and to Dr Nielssen that one of the victims of his offences, EC, was partially to blame for the offences involving her.   As for the incest offences concerning his daughter, CB, when she was an adult, the applicant also had an explanation involving some blameworthiness on her part.  The judge could not determine whether his claims were true or not but considered there was no mitigation of the seriousness of his offending in any event.
23His Honour found that the applicant has ""shown very little remorse"".  He had acknowledged that his actions were wrong but had not faced up to the damage his actions had caused his victims.  Further, he had told lies about the extent of his sexual misconduct.
24It was acknowledged that the assessment of rehabilitation prospects is not solely dependent upon a finding that an offender is remorseful.  The judge referred to the applicant's preparedness to participate in counselling programs but said that, nonetheless, his prospects in this respect ""must be guarded"".   He accepted that there was no risk of the applicant again sexually interfering with his own children.  But he added:
""Dr Nielssen has diagnosed a disorder of abnormal sexual interest in underage females and there remains a reasonable risk that he might attempt to photograph young children in inappropriate poses, or sexually interfere with them, or access child pornography in the future.""
25The risk of future offending was the subject of one of the grounds of appeal so I will say more about his Honour's assessment of this aspect in that context. 
26Finally in terms of personal circumstances, the judge was clearly mindful of the applicant's age, noting as he did that the non-parole period he intended to impose would not see him released until ""he is well advanced in years"".  (The applicant will be aged 68 when his non-parole period expires).
Assessment of seriousness of the offences
27There was no complaint about the judge's assessment of the seriousness of the applicant's offences but some brief reference to it is appropriate.
28The s 66A offence involving sexual intercourse with his 6 year old daughter, GB, in 1993 was regarded as the most serious of all the offences (and produced the longest of the indicative sentences).  It was not an isolated aberration; it involved penile/vaginal intercourse, albeit to a limited extent and for a relatively short duration (a few minutes); it was unwelcome (the child cried); and there was little force and no threats or pressure.  However the applicant had relied upon his natural authority of being an adult and her affection for him as her father.  His Honour assessed the seriousness of this offence as being in ""the mid-range"".  
29The judge was mindful of the need to have regard to sentencing patterns and principles at the time the offence was committed:  see, for example, R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368.  No complaint was raised by the applicant as to his Honour's approach in this respect.
30His Honour then proceeded to explain his assessment of the seriousness of the other offences.  Included in this assessment was a stated awareness of the need to avoid double counting of certain factors and that some of the offences were of a lower level of seriousness. 
31As to the assessment of sentences generally, it was again noted that some were committed in breach of a good behaviour bond and there was a need in respect of two matters to reflect a greater emphasis upon deterrence and retribution where additional offences were being taken into account.  Although he did not explicitly say so, it is apparent that his Honour was mindful of the guidance provided by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] (Spigelman CJ).
32The judge found that the incest offences were ""of serious proportions and higher than mid-range in the range of offences that fit within the section"".  In this respect he specifically took into account the position of trust occupied by the applicant and that the offences ""occurred as a culmination of a prolonged period during which the victim would have been wholly disempowered and her true consent suborned"". 
33His Honour's analysis of the seriousness of the child pornography offences exhibits a similarly careful and analytical approach.  He demonstrated an awareness of relevant sentencing principles for such offences without resorting to any lengthy exposition of technical jurisprudence on the subject.  
34Included in his assessment was the fact that the applicant had amassed such material over an 18 year period and the quantity was vast.  Importantly, care was expressed about the need to assess the appropriate sentence for the individual offences and ultimately his Honour discriminated in his assessment of each of them.  The most serious were found to be those identified as sequences 28 and 29.  About these, his Honour said:
""Sequence 28 found on his laptops and hard drives at his home at Campbelltown contained between 449,000 and 475,000 child pornography images and a mass of video files.  The largest bracket of videos (174) was Copine level 9 category.  (It is this matter that the Form 1 matter attaches, having 7 further possess child abuse material offences and the offence of surreptitiously filming his wife naked).
Sequence 29, which is the most serious, concerns the 534 CDs and DVDs located at the Kennard storage facility.  They contained about 860,000 and 900,000 child pornography images and nearly 1,700 videos.  That is about twice the amount of material as sequence 28.  Whilst the largest number of images was of erotic posing, a significant number were in Copine level 7 to 10 scale.
Clearly sequence 28 and 29 fall into upper 'echelon to this kind of offending'.  The total number of images and videos involved, the numerous children involved and the sheer depravity [of] what was displayed compels this conclusion.""
35Some of that material comprised recordings of offences committed against the applicant's children and their friends and provided the basis for charges to be laid.  Some of those recordings had captions added later, presumably for the applicant's, and potentially for others', perverted titillation.  One example is a recording of sexual activity performed at the applicant's behest by EC which concluded with the caption:
""This hot movie is brought to you by [EC]!!! One super hottie!!! And do you think she enjoyed herself!!!  You bet she did !!!  She loved every minute of it !!!""
Grounds of appeal
36The grounds of appeal, as originally formulated, were:
1. In the structure and casting of the overall sentence inadequate weight or no weight was accorded to the Applicant's pleas of guilty beyond the utilitarian discount.
2. In all of the circumstances the non-parole period expressed as a ratio of the sentence was eighty-two per cent (82%).  The ratio was manifestly excessive and too severe.
3. In the determination of the aggregate sentence and non-parole period excessive weight was placed upon the principle of specific deterrence in all of the circumstances.  The age of the Applicant was a significant feature in the assessment of the question of specific deterrence.
Ground 1 - inadequate, or no, weight to pleas of guilty beyond utilitarian value
37As indicated above, the judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty.  Mr Webb, counsel for the applicant, submitted that the pleas had relevance beyond that aspect.  ""Insufficient"" weight was said to have been given to the ""subjective features of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation"". 
38Attention was invited to the fact that the applicant had made a number of admissions when interviewed by police following his arrest; he had indicated a preparedness to participate in appropriate counselling programs; and he had facilitated the course of justice by his relatively early pleas of guilty.  Counsel for the applicant also referred to the assertion to Dr Nielssen in respect of the sexual intercourse with GB when she was aged 6 that the applicant ""said that he felt disgusted by his actions at that time and that he had acknowledged the offence when it came to light about eight years later, when [GB] was aged thirteen"".
39I have earlier referred to his Honour's finding that the applicant had ""shown very little remorse"".  One matter he referred to in that respect was that the applicant had told lies about the extent of his sexual misconduct.  An example of that can be found in what the applicant told Dr Nielssen about the offence concerning GB when she was 6.  He told the doctor that it was ""a single incident of rubbing her in the genital area"".  A month after his interview with Dr Nielssen, the applicant signed the statement of agreed facts which included that there had in fact been penetration.
40The applicant's pleas of guilty were not a reliable indicator of remorse.  There was no argument about them having been entered in the face of a strong prosecution case.  The pleas are at least as much a recognition of the inevitability of conviction as they are of remorse: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12] (Howie J).
41Another matter the judge considered was that the applicant had not acknowledged the damage his actions had caused his victims.  It was conceded that this was a finding that was open to his Honour.  Section 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act confines a finding of remorse as a mitigating feature: an offender must provide evidence of an acceptance of responsibility for his or her actions and, inter alia, acknowledge any injury, loss or damage caused.
42As for rehabilitation, the concern expressed by the judge about the prospect of further offending in the light of Dr Nielssen's assessment of the applicant having a disorder of abnormal sexual interest in underage females was not (and could not) be challenged.  It is relevant as well to have regard to the fact that the applicant's offending behaviour spanned some 18 years, in the middle of which he was held to account for two offences of possessing child pornography and continued his offending undeterred. Having regard to these matters, it is unsurprising that the judge found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were ""guarded"". 
43The ""weight"" to be given to matters such as remorse and rehabilitation prospects is a matter for the discretionary assessment of a sentencing judge and the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify appellate intervention are narrowly confined: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] (Spigelman CJ). They fall for assessment under the principles of appellate review of discretionary decision-making set out in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.
44In my view, the assessment of Arnott DCJ of these matters resulted in findings that were well open to him.  There was no merit in this ground.
Ground 2 - the non-parole period, as 82 per cent of the head sentence, was manifestly excessive
45Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act includes: 
""(2B)  The term of the sentence that will remain to be served after the non-parole period set for the aggregate sentence of imprisonment is served must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision)"". (Emphasis added)
46It can be seen that there is no prohibition or constraint upon setting a balance of the term of a sentence at less than one-third of the non-parole period.
47Three arguments were advanced in support of the contention that the non-parole period was excessive.  First, it failed to reflect adequate weight being given to the applicant's pleas and his facilitation of the course of justice.  Secondly, there was a failure to have regard to a substantial accumulation of sentences.  Thirdly, his Honour expressed a finding of ""special circumstances"" but this was not translated into the non-parole and parole components of the aggregate sentence.
48I have discussed the first matter in the context of the first ground.
49In relation to the second matter, it was necessary to consider that the total of the indicative terms of imprisonment for the applicant's 15 offences (with 12 more taken into account) was just short of 34 years.  The judge said that he had regard to the principle of totality in the assessment of the overall sentence and this explains his imposition of an aggregate term of 17 years.  (I stress that the judge did not adopt a mathematical approach; I mention the total of the indicative sentences simply to demonstrate the substantial impact the totality principle had upon his assessment of the ultimate sentence).
50It was against that overall term that the judge had to consider the term of the non-parole period.  Such a period is the minimum time that a court determines justice requires an offender to serve having regard to all the circumstances of the offence(s): Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 717 [57]-[59] (Spigelman CJ).  The Chief Justice added in the latter (at 718 [63]) that ""the ultimate constraint"" is that the non-parole period must appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence(s).  
51It is correct that the judge announced a finding of ""special circumstances by reason of the accumulation of the sentences"".  He only reflected this in the sentence for the s 66A offence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  
52I have earlier mentioned that there was no need for his Honour to have indicated a non-parole period for the indicative sentences unless a standard non-parole period was prescribed.  There is such a prescription in respect of a s 66A offence but it does not apply to an offence committed in 1993.
53I have also mentioned that his Honour specified commencement dates for each of the indicative sentences but that he did not have to.  The commencement date specified for the s 66A sentence was the last in time, 18 June 2020.  If the judge had been imposing individual sentences, it would have been unremarkable for him to at least find special circumstances in relation to the last in a series of accumulated sentences so that an appropriate parole period was created within the total term.
54The judge was conscious of the fact that the potential period of parole was 3 years and that this was less than a third of the non-parole period.  After he had announced the indicative and aggregate sentences, the Crown Prosecutor raised with his Honour that he had made a finding of special circumstances but that the non-parole period was 82 per cent of the total term. He confirmed that the finding was confined to the sentence for the s 66A offence and that there was no need for a finding of special circumstances in respect of the aggregate term where the non-parole component was more than 75 per cent.
55In Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279, a sentencing judge found special circumstances which were reflected in individual sentences but in the total term that resulted from partial accumulation, the non-parole component was 75.8 per cent.  No error was found because her Honour had specifically adverted to and intended this result.
56I discussed this issue of findings of special circumstances not being translated into an overall sentence in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [28]-[37].  I said in part:
""[36] Where this Court has intervened, it has usually been the case that the sentencing judge has not given effect to a finding of special circumstances through inadvertence or miscalculation. Often this has occurred where sentences have been accumulated but it has occurred in single sentencing exercises as well.""
57In that case, as in Houri and the present case, there was no inadvertence or miscalculation.  The final result was precisely what the judge intended.
58It was contended that the non-parole period is manifestly excessive but I was not persuaded that it is. The criminality inherent in the applicant's offences, whilst low in respect of some of the individual offences, was very substantial overall.  His offending, as I have observed, spanned some 18 years.  There were six identified victims, five of them being his own children or their childhood friends.  The offences occurred when the children were as young as 6 (GB) and 7 (EC).  Many of the offences were video-taped and captioned for later viewing.  In addition, there were the countless unidentified victims of the child pornography offences. 
59The applicant's collection of child pornographic material was described by the judge as ""massive - in total between 1.3 and 1.4 million still images and a further 3,288 videos"".    Without descending into explicit detail about the nature of this material, an indication of the level of depravity of some of it can be gleaned from the description in the statement of agreed facts of some of the videos:
""A number of the videos are classified 10 on the Copine scale and depict children being tied, bound, in pain or engaged in sexual behaviour with an animal.""  
60There was no merit in this ground.
Ground 3 - excessive weight placed upon specific deterrence
61In contending that excessive weight was placed upon specific deterrence it was submitted that the risk of the applicant re-offending was less than the judge had assessed it to be.  He accepted that there was no risk of further interference with the applicant's own children but it was argued that the risk of interfering with other children was minimal, or absent, given his past offending had been against children to whom he had ready access.  It was also contended that the evidence did not establish that there was a likelihood of further offending in relation to the possession of child abuse material. Too much weight was therefore given to the protection of the community in the assessment of both the total term and the non-parole period.
62A further submission was that insufficient weight was given to the age of the applicant.  He will be 68 when he becomes eligible for release on parole, thereby reducing his risk of re-offending.  Age was also relevant to characterising the sentence as ""crushing"" because it ""will more probably than not occupy, in large part, the substantial balance of worthwhile life remaining to the applicant"".   Counsel for the applicant referred in this respect to R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502, but I note that what was said there about advanced age of an offender concerned a man who was aged 75 at the time of sentencing and who would not be eligible for parole until his early 80's.
63The applicant's age was not a factor requiring a lesser sentence or non-parole period.  It was not contended that imprisonment would be more onerous on account of his age or that his health or life expectancy had any particularly bearing upon the assessment of sentence.
64The judge did not mention specific deterrence but did deal with the applicant's rehabilitation and mentioned his age in that context:
""Notwithstanding his willingness to participate in counselling programs made available as referred to by Dr Nielssen, his prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded.  As regards the risk of his re-offending the reality is there is no risk he will sexually interfere with his children again.  However, Dr Nielssen has diagnosed a disorder of abnormal sexual interest in underage females and there remains a reasonable risk that he might attempt to photograph young children in inappropriate poses, or sexually interfere with them, or access child pornography in the future.
A sentencing judge may not extend the period of sentence for the purpose of preventative detention but that is not to say that the protection of the community is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence.  Mr Winch submits that the Crown has not established that there is a 'significant risk' that he will re-offend.  Furthermore he submits correctly that he will be much older when the non parole period expires, being a relevant consideration to this issue.  Nonetheless I consider there is a significant risk that he will attempt to possess child abuse material in the future.  My finding of greater dangerousness in this regard does not follow from his absence of contrition and remorse, it is based upon abnormal sexual disorder about which Dr Nielson spoke.""
65According to the first of Dr Nielssen's two reports, the applicant's interest was in ""girls aged between twelve and nineteen"".  Given that his children were all adults, the judge was correct to dismiss any concern about further offending in relation to them. But as to other children, including those who may be the subject of child pornography, the quantity and nature of the material in the applicant's possession of such material provided grounds for real concern.  
66The applicant's entrenched interest and desire in relation to child sexual abuse provided grounds for significant scepticism about his prospects of rehabilitation.  There is no error in his Honour's reasoning or conclusion.  For my part I considered that no other conclusion could be justified.  Specific deterrence was a significant matter in the assessment of sentence and I was not persuaded that this ground had merit.
Two further matters
67The Crown fairly drew the Court's attention to two errors in the sentencing remarks and they became the subject of two further grounds that were added the day before the hearing.  One was the gap between the conclusion of some of the sentences and the commencement of the next sentence.  The period involved is one year.  I referred to this earlier and did not think it was material.  It was quite plain that the judge applied the principle of totality and assessed the appropriate aggregate sentence as being one of 17 years.  The dates he unnecessarily applied to the indicative sentences were obviously an attempt to achieve his intended result.  The fact that an error crept in had no bearing on the outcome.
68The other error identified was in the judge's statement that the maximum penalty for the s 61N(1) offences was 7 years whereas it is 2 years.  For these two offences the judge indicated sentences of 6 months.  It would seem that his Honour was misled in this respect by an error in the ""Crown Sentence Summary"" that accompanied its tendered documents and a repetition of the error in the submissions of counsel who appeared for the applicant (AB 294.8).  The error as to the statement of the maximum penalty had no material bearing upon the assessment of the aggregate sentence.  No correction by way of resentencing was called for.
Conclusion
69The sentence imposed was obviously a substantial one but it was well warranted by the nature, gravity and duration of the applicant's offending.
70None of the proposed grounds of appeal had any merit and so it was appropriate that leave to appeal be refused. 71SCHMIDT J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

2763363,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 171,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  All accused wish in various ways to contest the admissibility of certain material upon which the Crown proposes to rely.  At the heart of the competing contentions is the question of whether material in a joint trial that is clearly admissible against one accused, but not admissible against the others, should be excluded upon the basis that its unfairly prejudicial effect upon either or both of the other accused cannot be ameliorated or eradicated by appropriate warnings or directions.  The issue requires consideration, among other things, of whether directions to the jury, that they must disregard the evidence when considering the guilt or innocence of the accused in whose cases the evidence cannot be used, will be adequate or sufficient to neutralise or dispel the prejudice potentially arising if the directions were not heeded or followed. 
2The material in question has been helpfully collected in a folder with coded markings to indicate what is and what is not contentious.  Agreement has already been reached with respect to much of the material.  It will, however, be necessary for present purposes to set out in every case those parts of the evidence that remain in dispute.
Intercepted phone calls from gaol
3On 15 January 2012, Bernard Spicer spoke on the telephone from gaol to Peggy Case in terms that included the following:
""Spicer: Everyone knows about me, it was on the news.  Even, when I went to classo the other day he goes what are you, he looked he goes who did you murder, I said some solicitor.  He goes the one in Wollongong.
Case: You're meant to say nobody.
Spicer: Yeah, but it's on there as that so they ask.""
4The Crown contends that this material is capable of amounting to an admission.  Mr Spicer disagrees.  He submits that the material is unfairly prejudicial to him because the context makes it plain that Mr Spicer was answering a question that asked in effect who it was that Mr Spicer is alleged to have murdered.
5Mr Spicer is plainly repeating details in this call of the conversation he had with some prison officer or other official in the gaol.  The conversation that Mr Spicer is talking about appears to have all the hallmarks of a provocative jibe by the prison official in question, baiting Mr Spicer with a request for details of why he was there, and proceeding on the unspoken and unqualified assumption that he must be guilty.  Mr Spicer's answer also appears to me to have been given in the same vein.  
6I do not accept that Mr Spicer was making any admission of having committed the crime to which the prison officer referred.  I am also of the view that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Mr Spicer.
7On 27 January 2012, Mr Spicer again spoke on the telephone from gaol to Ms Case in terms that included the following:
""Spicer: But this one will determine how long I stay in gaol like they'll say all right we'll. ...Five years or something.
Case: Mmm.
Spicer: It's going to be better than fuckin' doing twenty-five.
Case: Yeah, that's true.""
8Mr Spicer contends that this material is completely irrelevant.  It falls to be considered in the context of the conversation as a whole.  Earlier in the conversation, Mr Spicer says, ""they can't charge me with murder 'cause I didn't know she was home.""  He goes on to say, ""they can only charge me with the fire so hopefully they'll turn around and say all right you plead guilty to this and we'll give you this.""  A review of the whole of the conversation reveals that Mr Spicer is hoping to come to some kind of plea bargain.  He recognises that there is a risk of a sentence of 25 years if no such bargain is reached and he is convicted of murder.
9There has always been a disinclination to place material before juries that deals with the length of any sentence that an accused person who is facing trial might be given or become liable to if convicted.  The Crown's purposes are adequately and accurately served by the parts of the conversation to which no objection is taken.  I consider that the words ""It's going to be better than fuckin' doing twenty-five"" should be rejected.  The probative value of these words is in my view clearly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Mr Spicer.
10On 31 December 2011, Michelle Proud spoke on the telephone from gaol to Ms Case in terms that included the following:
""Proud:  What's wrong?
Case: Nothing.
Proud: Don't cry.
Case: I can't help it.
Proud: Huh?
Case: I can't help it.
Proud: Why, what's wrong?
Case: But, I just can't believe it.  I never ever thought he'd do somethin' like this ...
Proud: I told you that I'd have to explain it to you, I can't explain it to you over the phone, but pretty much it wasn't supposed to happen like that, it was more ---
Case: Doesn't matter how it was meant to happen.
Proud: It's more the other person that's involved in it, but this, what's happened with this person, was not supposed to happen like that.  It was just supposed to be a scare.  But I'd have to explain it to you more, I can't do it over the phone, but it wasn't ---
Case: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Proud --- it wasn't, it wasn't, BJ wasn't supposed to go in there and do that, it was more the other one, OK, so ---""
11This material is admissible as evidence against Ms Proud but is not admissible as evidence in the case against Mr Spicer.  Although there may be other evidence that touches the question, it is on one view not clear on the face of this material whether Ms Proud is speaking as a person who knew before the fire what had been planned, or as a person who only learned later what had occurred.  It is nonetheless arguably important evidence in the Crown case against Ms Proud with obvious probative value that she had knowledge of what occurred at some time.  
12Whatever might ultimately be seen as the answer to that question, Mr Spicer says that this material is so unfairly prejudicial to him that no warning or direction to a jury that it cannot and should not be used by them to reason toward a guilty verdict or be used in any other way whatsoever in his case is capable of dispelling that prejudice.
13It is not at all clear, in using the words, ""I never thought he'd do somethin' like this"" that Ms Case is referring to Mr Spicer.  That remains so even in light of the words, ""BJ wasn't supposed to go in there and do that, it was more the other one.""  However, in my view those latter words are definitively prejudicial to Mr Spicer.  Even though Mr Spicer objects to the whole of the passage I consider that the unfair prejudice to him can be adequately and sufficiently overcome by the rejection of the words, ""BJ wasn't supposed to go in there and do that, it was more the other one.""  
14On 1 January 2012, Ms Proud spoke on the telephone from gaol to Cecilia Todorovic in terms that included the following:
""Proud: --- he literally didn't do it how she thinks he's done it, you know what I mean, but yeah ---
Todorovic: So, he, he was led to believe there was nobody in the house, that right, or not?
Proud:  No.
Todorovic: Oh, OK.
Proud: It's, I, it's hard to, because ---
Todorovic: Yeah.
Proud: --- my phone calls get recorded.
Todorovic: Yeah, I know, love, no don't worry ...
Proud:   But, yeah, but it wasn't supposed to turn out like the way it was, it was only supposed to be a scare.
Todorovic: Yeah.
Proud: But, I'd have to explain it to you more, when I see you next, how it really, what ---
Todorovic: ...
Proud: --- really happened, for it to go like that, but yeah, it was only supposed to be a scare, not this total whole thing that it's turned out to be.""
15Once again this material is admissible in the trial of Ms Proud but entirely inadmissible in the trial of Mr Spicer.  He contends that it is unfairly prejudicial to him in a way that cannot be cured by an appropriate warning or direction to the jury. 
16It is not clear from this conversation taken in isolation whether Ms Proud is speaking about what she knew in advance of the fire or only about what she has later been told. The probative value of the material in the Crown case against her will have to deal with that uncertainty.  It is nevertheless evidence of some value to the Crown in its case against Ms Proud.
17However, there is an obvious and potentially unfair prejudice to Mr Spicer if all of this material is admitted.  References to things like, ""it wasn't supposed to turn out like the way it was, it was only supposed to be a scare"", are contained in other statements made by Ms Proud in recorded conversations.  They are not in my view prejudicial, and certainly not unfairly prejudicial, to Mr Spicer. The same cannot be said of the statements that deal with advance knowledge of who was in the house.  That question has been foreshadowed by counsel for Mr Spicer as his response to the Crown case.  It has nothing to do with the case against Ms Proud.  It is apt to identify, or be assumed unfairly by the jury to identify, Mr Spicer as the person about whom Ms Proud is speaking.  I am doubtful that any warning or direction to the jury could adequately neutralise or eradicate the prejudice that some of the words spoken by Ms Proud could create.  In my opinion it is not necessary to reject all of that part of the conversation to which Mr Spicer takes objection, but the following words should be entirely rejected:
""Proud: --- he literally didn't do it how she thinks he's done it, you know what I mean, but yeah ---
Todorovic: So, he, he was led to believe there was nobody in the house, that right, or not?
Proud:  No.
Todorovic: Oh, OK.""
Recovered text messages and recorded phone messages
18On 2 November 2011, a text message was sent from a public telephone to the mobile phone of Wendy Evans in these terms:
""HEY U HAVE 1 HR 2 PUT MY MONEY IN TAB OR IM GOIN 2 HIS 2 WEL U KNO I DNT CARE WHO GTS HURT IF NOT THERE I WIL HUNT U DWN DNT FUK ME.""
19There is no way of establishing who in fact sent this message.  The highest point for the Crown in this respect is a contention that Mr Spicer has elsewhere used language that is redolent of that used in this text, and that the jury could fairly reason from the evidence as a whole that he was its author.  Mr Spicer submits that the material is unfairly prejudicial to him, as he does not know who sent the text and has no way of verifying its authenticity or provenance.  On the contrary, the Crown's submission that it was sent by him has little probative value when compared to other similar messages of which he is arguably the author and which strongly indicate that Mr Spicer was demanding his money.
20The most fundamental difficulty with this material is that it cannot be sourced to Mr Spicer.  It is unfairly prejudicial to him in the circumstances.  Its probative value is also very limited, especially by comparison with other evidence of similar threats made from sources arguably traceable to Mr Spicer.  I consider that the Crown's proposal to tender this message against Mr Spicer should be rejected.
21On 17 November 2011, Mr Spicer left a recorded voice message on the mobile phone of Wendy Evans in these terms:
""I'm going to fucking kill you, you dog.  Wait till I get you.""
22Mr Spicer's objection to this message is not that it cannot be shown to be from him, but that the language used is apt unfairly to sway a jury against him.  References to killing Ms Evans are said to be likely to inflame sentiment against him in the particular context of his trial on a charge of murder.
23I disagree.  The jury has already heard, and by all accounts are likely to receive considerably more, violent and aggressive suggestions from a number of sources.  I perceive nothing particularly prejudicial, and certainly nothing unfairly prejudicial, to Mr Spicer in the circumstances.  On the contrary, the probative value to the Crown is high, especially given Mr Spicer's answer to the police at question 254 in his 21 December 2011 ERISP when he said, concerning Ms Evans, ""Like I even told her not to worry about the rest of the money that she owes me.  I just don't want anything to do with it.""
24I consider that the material to which objection is taken is admissible.
25On 15 December 2011, Michelle Proud called Bernard Spicer.  Towards the end of the conversation Mr Spicer said the following:
""'Cause I'm telling you, fuckin' (pause) I swear to God, if they fuck me they won't have to worry about fuckin' some cunt hunting them down 'cause I'll get them.
...
I don't care.  You just tell her if she fucks me, if my name gets mentioned I'll dead set, I'll hunt her down and I'll kill her myself.""
26Mr Spicer objects to this material on similar grounds.  (No objection was in fact taken to the first sentence but it seems to me that it deserves consideration in the same context as the second sentence). In my opinion the evidence is admissible for the same or similar reasons as those expressed with respect to the immediately preceding objection.
27On 18 December 2011, Ms Proud left a recorded voice message on the mobile phone of Wendy Evans in these terms:
""I want my fucking money bitch and this is Michelle.  Where is my fucking money?  I'll come down and I'll hunt you down.  I know where Brad lives so don't fucking stuff me around.  I'm nearly kicked out of my fucking house.""
28This material falls into a similar category.  Ms Proud objects to it being admitted upon the basis that it will or may incite an unfair and emotional response from the jury, having regard to the language that she has used. In my opinion its probative value is high and it is not unfairly prejudicial to her.  It is plainly admissible and I propose to allow it.  To the extent that it throws up any question about who may be the author of the expression ""hunt you down"" to be found elsewhere in the evidence, it amounts to a classic jury question and they should be entitled to consider it.
Michelle Proud's ERISP
29Ms Proud gave an electronically recorded interview with the police on 21 December 2011.  Part of the interview is as follows:
""Q463 O.K.  So what did Wendy also tell you about this?
A  She just kept going on that she wants her done real good for all the threats and what she's put Brad through, what Katie's put Brad through.  That Katie threatened Brad for a few times and that Brad has come over to Wendy's house with bruises on him and everything, where Katie's hit him with pots and pans and, and that Wendy was just sick of it.  She was sick of being scared, she was sick of being threatened.  She's my friend, she'd been stalked.
...
Q501 O.K.  The $1,000 ---
A  BJ told me that there was $1,000 put in the TAB account.
Q502 When?
A  Ah, that day, the day Wendy came and picked us up.
Q503 O.K.  What did he tell you about that $1,000?
A  He told me that Wendy had told him Brad had put it in or something like that.  I'm not, I'm not too sure, but he told me Wendy had put the money in to help us down at Wollongong.
...
Q512 And when you say they were going to pay three thousand, who was --- 
A  Brad and Wendy.
Q513 Who was going to pay her?
A  Wendy was getting the money off Brad.
...
Q556 But when you say ---
A  Because, because it's very confusing because I don't know most of it, I've just heard here and here what's going on.  Um, the first thing Wendy told me in the car was it was um, Brad was going to leave the door unlocked when he went there.  And then all of a sudden I'm hearing that there was a key dropped.
...
Q561 And what was the purpose of Brad going to the house?
A  Apparently Wendy told me in conversations we've had that Brad would still go over there.
Q562 Right.
A  Every afternoon.
Q563 O.K.
A   He'd go there, sit with her or what not and then he'd leave.  Because that's why Wendy said it was too hard for her to see him because he was always over at Katie's.
Q564 If the door was left, if Brad, if the plan was for Brad to leave and leave the door, the door unlocked or the sliding door unlocked?
A  The door unlocked I think it was.
Q565 What's the purpose of the key?
A  Well it must have changed.  I don't know.  He might've gave Wendy a key and that 'cause he had two keys.  This is what Wendy told me.  He had two keys, he gave her one.
Q566 He gave, Brad gave Wendy a key ---
A   A key.
Q566 --- to the house?
A  Yep.
Q567 Being 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal, where Katie lives?
A  Yeah.""
30Mr Rawlinson objects to question and answer 463 upon the basis that it is hearsay in the first place, about the state of mind of Wendy Evans who is not available for cross-examination in the second place, and inadmissible against him in the third place.  His concern is that the frailty of the evidence alone, or in combination with the fact that the jury will have to be warned and directed about the use that can be made of it, causes him unfair prejudice.
31The evidence is important in the Crown case against Ms Proud.  It arguably places her before the fire with knowledge of what is to take place.  It is on one view highly probative of Ms Proud's participation in the alleged joint criminal enterprise that led to the death of the deceased, albeit necessarily in combination with other evidence about that.  However, these considerations are not relevant to the single question of whether or not the perceived prejudice to Mr Rawlinson can be adequately ameliorated or eradicated by a proper warning or direction to the jury.
32I am unable to discern any particular prejudice from this evidence that might be caused to Mr Rawlinson at all.  It is relatively inconsequential in the scheme of anything contributed in this ERISP by Ms Proud, particularly when compared to question and answer 459, and the earlier answers that provoked it, to which Mr Rawlinson takes no objection.
33I consider that this evidence is admissible.
34Mr Rawlinson objects to questions and answers 501 to 503 and 512 to 513.  There is independent evidence to support the allegation that Mr Rawlinson deposited $1,000 into a TAB account prior to the fire.  To that extent there does not appear to me to be any unfair prejudice to him from the somewhat anodyne response by Ms Proud to these police questions.
35I consider that this evidence should be admitted. An appropriate warning or direction can adequately deal with any potential prejudice arising from the fact that it cannot be used by the jury in the case against Mr Rawlinson.
36Mr Rawlinson objects to question and answers 556 and 561 to 567.  He is concerned that they are not evidence against him and if admitted as evidence in the trial they will require a warning and direction to the jury to that effect.  They also contain hearsay material that cannot in any event be challenged.
37The subject matter of this evidence is to some extent confusing and inconsistent.  It contains contradictory suggestions that the door to 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal was to be left unlocked on the one hand but also contains the suggestion that two keys were to be provided on the other hand.  There is evidence in the trial already that a key was located by police somewhere outside the premises following the fire.
38This evidence is arguably supportive of the Crown case against Ms Proud of her knowledge of the details of what was to occur at the scene of the fire beforehand.  It obviously remains open to the suggestion that it is no more than Ms Proud's recitation after the event of what she had been told did occur, and therefore less helpful if not completely unhelpful to the Crown case against her.  
39It is significant in this context that Ms Proud does not suggest that she had any knowledge of what was to occur that derived from Mr Rawlinson.  All of her assertions about his alleged involvement are hearsay statements that come from others.  In the case against her, the truth of the assertions made to her is less important than her knowledge of them and the time relative to the fire that she acquired the knowledge. 
40The issue for determination is whether this material, if admitted, is capable of being effectively quarantined in the case against Mr Rawlinson as evidence upon which the jury cannot and should not rely in reasoning towards its verdict in his trial.  
41I have come to the conclusion that this material is so prejudicial to Mr Rawlinson that it should be excluded.  The reliability of Ms Proud's assertions is arguably small. She disclaims in terms its source in the statement, ""I've just heard here and here what's going on"". Whilst that disclaimer may be wholly self-serving, it potentially adds to the prejudice that Mr Rawlinson identifies.  Moreover, Ms Proud says in some of the material that, ""[a]pparently Wendy told [her] in conversations [they've] had that Brad would still go over.""  Ms Proud's confidence in the correctness of this assertion is absent on its face.  In addition, question 564 is egregiously leading and the answer to question 565 is inconclusive.
42Taken as a whole I consider that this evidence is unfairly prejudicial to Mr Rawlinson in the sense that it cannot be made the subject of a warning or direction to the jury, that it is not to be treated in any sense as evidence in the Crown case against him, that I have any confidence will be, or is likely to be heeded or followed.  There is a distinct prejudice to Mr Rawlinson that such a warning or direction will be disregarded because of the subject matter being discussed. 
Bernard Spicer's ERISP
43Bernard Spicer also gave an electronically recorded interview with the police on 21 December 2011.  Part of the interview is as follows:
""Q83 Who's they?
A   Well, Wendy, Wendy turned around and said Brad would pay me three grand to do it.
Q84   O.K.
A   I turned around and I said, 'All right'.  And set her car on fire, you know what I mean, like, well they put a $1,000 in me sisters TAB account and Wendy come and picked us up.
Q85   On that day?
A   On that day.  Then I turned around and said to her, what did she want me to do?  She turned around and she goes, 'Look, I'm going to get, Brad's going to give me the keys, all you have to do is just run inside or whatever, throw a bucket of petrol down and light it'.
...
Q135   O.K. Did she describe to you anything about that?  Just basically checking that ---
A  She wanted to, all, all she said, all she said, all she's ever said to me about Brad was that Katie didn't know her, him, like her and Brad were sleeping together.
...
Q139   Was Brad meant to have been at Katie's house?
A   Brad, Brad was the one that gave Wendy the keys, his keys to the place because no one was there.
Q140  When, when ---
A  Well that's what Wendy told me
...
Q167  Yeah.
A   And Michelle turned around and she goes, 'Well Wendy said it's going to be all right'.  Like because she had the keys and that, oh well, rightio.
Q168 O.K.  So then what happened?
A   Well, I, I didn't, I didn't want to go back.  I went in the bathroom and I took some drugs and they weren't helping, nothing was.  It was just something weird about the whole thing.
Q169 What did you say, you took some drugs, what do you mean?
A   I took some drugs.
Q170  Like what?
A   I had some Ice.
...
Q224  Yeah.  And you gave it back to her?
A   Well she had to give them back to Brad.

44Mr Rawlinson objects to questions and answers 83 to 85.  The only prejudicial material in this sequence of questions are the words, ""Brad's going to give me.""  They can be conveniently excised without doing injustice to the balance of the material.  Leaving them in as part of the ERISP would in my view cause unfair prejudice to Mr Rawlinson.  It could not be said that a jury direction or warning about the legitimate use that they could make of this evidence would likely be sufficient to eradicate or ameliorate the prejudice.
45For precisely the same reasons I consider that questions and answers 139 and 140 should also be excluded.  Question and answer 135 do not fall into that category and can remain.
46Ms Proud objects to question and answer 167.  This evidence is not admissible in the case against her.  It is objectionable as evidence of the truth of what Wendy Evans is alleged to have said.  Wendy Evans will not be called as a witness.  It is unfairly prejudicial to Ms Proud in the sense that a jury might illegitimately reason from it that Ms Proud had foreknowledge of what was to occur at 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal.  It is inadmissible against her and I am fearful that a warning or direction to the jury about its unavailability as evidence in Ms Proud's trial may not be heeded or followed.
47This evidence should be rejected.
48Mr Spicer objects to questions and answers 168 to 170 and 430 to 431.  They refer to his use of drugs, specifically ice.  He maintains that this evidence is not probative of anything, is therefore irrelevant and is otherwise prejudicial.
49I disagree.  This is evidence out of his mouth.  It touches a circumstance that the jury might consider to be relevant.  It suffers from a lack of specificity, in the sense that the quantity of the drug consumed, as opposed to the quantity of the drug purchased, is not indicated.  Be that as it may, whatever its underlying usefulness or lack of it, this evidence is an admissible part of the factual matrix.  I am not satisfied that any prejudicial pejorative effect flows from the admission of drug use in this society in 2014.  If it does, its prejudicial effect in the circumstances in question is not relevantly unfair to Mr Spicer.
50Mr Rawlinson objects to question and answer 224. It refers to the issue of the keys.  It falls to be assessed in the same fashion as the earlier evidence dealing with that issue.  I consider that it should be rejected.
51Mr Rawlinson also objects to questions and answers 226 to 227.  This evidence is not admissible against him.  This evidence has the potential to be used by the jury in consideration of the case against him even notwithstanding a warning or direction to the contrary.  I consider that it should therefore be rejected.
52Ms Proud objects to questions and answers 261 to 263 and 268.  She contends that the material is not relevant, even though inadmissible against her.  The material does not appear to me to create an unfair prejudice to Ms Proud, in the sense that the jury might illegitimately use it as evidence against her.  There is other evidence in the proceedings so far dealing with payments of money.  This evidence is entirely capable of being quarantined by a jury following an appropriate warning or direction.  I have little doubt that the prospect of misuse of this material by the jury is negligible in the circumstances.  It should be admitted.
53Ms Proud objects to questions and answers 368 and 385.  This evidence is not admissible against her.  It is highly prejudicial inasmuch as it suggests that she and Mr Spicer had both earned money for what he had done.  Her case is at the very least that she was not concerned to benefit in a monetary or financial way from any arrangement or agreement to kill the deceased.  Given her relationship with Mr Spicer, this evidence is potentially inimical to that position and could easily be illegitimately used by the jury to her detriment even if an appropriate warning or direction were given.  I consider that it should be rejected.
A view of the scene
54R A Hulme J recently mused that if a ""picture is said to be worth a thousand words... sometimes a firsthand look can be worth a thousand pictures"": see R v Hawi & ors (No 7) [2011] NSWSC 1653 at [1]. In this case the Crown proposes a view of 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal, preferably at night or in conditions that otherwise mimic or resemble as closely as possible the conditions on the night that the deceased was killed.  The premises were partly destroyed by the fire but have since been restored to a habitable condition.
55A significant issue in the proceedings against Mr Spicer is whether or not he could have become aware that the deceased was asleep in her bed in the upstairs bedroom when the fire was set.  He agrees that he threw petrol into her bedroom but denies that at the time he did so he was aware of her presence, whether by reason of knowledge already acquired or, significantly for present purposes, by reason of anything that he saw or observed inside the bedroom when he did so.  I anticipate that it will be contended on his behalf that Mr Spicer did not enter the bedroom at all, and that the deceased's presence inside it could not be observed from the position that he took.  It may well also be his case that, to the extent that he might be thought to have moved inside the deceased's bedroom to any greater extent than a position in the doorway, he could even so still not see the deceased in her bed and that he in fact did not see her.
56Evidence in the form of a video recording of a walk through of the premises in their burnt and damaged condition has been tendered on this application.  I am informed that it will become evidence in the Crown case without objection.  It depicts the interior of the deceased's house, including the stairway leading up to the first floor, the landing where the body of the deceased was discovered and her bedroom as well.
57The Crown contends that the precise scope of the premises and the relative relationships and sizes of these rooms in particular cannot be adequately discerned from the video material.  The Crown submits that a view is essential to enable the jury properly to appreciate the layout of the premises and to assess what are foreshadowed to be the competing contentions concerning them.
58Mr Spicer maintains that the view is unnecessary.  He submits that there is a danger that any inspection of the premises might be unfairly prejudicial to him, and might also be misleading or confusing, quite apart from potentially causing or resulting in an undue waste of time: see s 53(3)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995.
59Mr Spicer's submissions appear to proceed upon the basis that transporting the jury to the scene of the fire and subjecting them at close and confined quarters to the cramped spaces where the deceased lived and ultimately died could only stir emotions and sentiments that would be unfairly prejudicial to him.  I accept that the proposed inspection may, but will not certainly, be accompanied by some prejudice.  I disagree that such prejudice will be unfair.  I do not consider that Mr Spicer would be exposed to any greater disadvantage than already exists in the face of his admission, through his counsel and his pleas, that he was present and directly involved in the commission of acts that killed the deceased.
60On the contrary, to the extent to which Mr Spicer has foreshadowed a defence that seeks to rely upon the internal layout or configuration of the premises, it would be potentially misleading to restrict the Crown to a reliance on photographic, diagrammatic and video evidence.  Moreover, the fact that the premises have been restored since the fire limits and constrains the potentially prejudicial effect that might possibly have flowed from an inspection conducted in the damaged conditions that existed when, and in which, the body of the deceased was discovered.
61Some suggestion has been made that the altered state of the premises may in fact add to the prejudice.  Visual and aural aspects or characteristics of the house may now be consciously observable or subliminally detectable that formerly did not exist.  For example, for all anyone presently knows, the stairs may now creak when walked upon in  possible contrast with the position in October 2011 or vice versa.  This to my mind is difficult to identify or assess, but is not unlike the prospect that an inspection of a bushland setting some years after the event must necessarily take account of the fact that vegetation may have grown or may have been removed.  It seems highly unlikely to me that any differences of this type that can be shown to exist will have a relevant effect upon the benefit that a view might otherwise provide. 
62I consider that the Crown's application for an inspection of 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal should be allowed.
Conclusions
63The conclusions I have reached will be apparent from what appears above. I will grant liberty to the parties to apply without notice in the event that there is any dispute about the scope or content of my evidentiary rulings.  I will also hear the parties if and when required concerning any outstanding or remaining rulings if the prospect of agreement among the parties about them has not materialised.

2763366,Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offences and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to the following offences:
Count 1 - Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to s59(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.

Count 2 - Sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

2In relation to Count 2, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 a further offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s61I.

3The applicant was sentenced as follows:

Count 1 - Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months, commencing 7 September 2011 (the date of his arrest) and expiring 6 March 2013.

Count 2 - (Taking into account the Form 1 offence) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years, commencing 7 September 2012 and expiring 6 September 2017, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months expiring 6 March 2020.

The total sentence was therefore imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.

4The applicant seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on a single ground (which was only concerned with the sentence for count 2).
The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.

Factual background

5The following facts were agreed. The applicant and the complainant had been in an on/off domestic relationship for a number of years. On Monday, 29 August 2011 the applicant was in the complainant's home drinking alcohol and had become intoxicated. During the afternoon, the complainant received two phone calls on her mobile phone after which the applicant became abusive towards her, calling a ""whore"" and a ""slut"".

6As a result of this abuse, the complainant left and visited a friend, Wayne Parton. She stayed at his place until later that evening, arriving home by bus shortly before midnight. The applicant was still awake and intoxicated when she arrived home.

7The applicant commenced to abuse the complainant and accused her of having just had sexual intercourse with Wayne Parton. When the complainant denied this and attempted to leave the room, the applicant grabbed her by the shirt and pulled her back into the lounge room. He punched her several times with a closed fist to the face (left eye and left cheek), left breast and leg. He also pulled her hair and bit her on the nose. While assaulting her, he was making threats to kill her and threatened to get his mates to ""fuck her from behind"".

8As a result of the assault, the complainant suffered the following injuries: two fractures to the left cheekbone and left eye socket. These injuries were treated without operative intervention by a surgeon. Other injuries included a red bite mark to her nose, scratch marks and tenderness to her left and right neck, bruises and tenderness to her left eye, left cheek, right upper arm, left upper arm, right knee, right upper leg, right shoulder and right hand. There was also tenderness to her left breast, her right lower back, both lower legs and both feet. Those injuries were relevant to Count 1.

9The complainant picked up her phone to call the police but the applicant knocked it out of her hand and kept it. The complainant then went to her bedroom and lay on her bed. The applicant followed her into the room and continued to accuse her of having sex with Wayne Parton. He spread her legs and forced his left hand inside her tracksuit pants and underpants. He forced his fingers inside her vagina, pulled them out and sniffed them. He told the complainant that he could smell semen and accused her of having had sex with Wayne Parton. He then wiped his fingers on the complainant's face saying ""That's cum, that's Wayne Parton's cum you slut, you dog"". Those were the facts relevant to Count 2.

10Over the next hour, the applicant continued to threaten the complainant and he once again forced his fingers into her vagina in a similar fashion, again smelt them and made a comment about smelling semen and wiped his fingers over her face. These were the facts relevant to the Form 1 offence. The complainant said that the verbal and physical abuse continued all night and into the morning and that she was petrified.

11On the afternoon of 30 August 2011 the complainant told the applicant that she was going to get some cigarettes, but he would not let her go by herself and went with her. While at the shopping centre he went into a liquor store to buy some more beer. At this point the complainant saw her friend Wayne Parton getting off a bus and took the opportunity to escape from the applicant. She then went with Wayne Parton to his home where the police were contacted. The applicant was arrested on 7 September 2011. He remained in custody following his arrest.

Remarks on sentence

12The sentencing judge accepted that both offences were impulsive and that excessive alcohol consumption played a part. He characterised the assault as follows:

""A violent attack accompanied by verbal abuse and threats designed to instil fear into the victim. This was no simple single punch. The attack was directed to different parts of her body and the resulting fracturing of her left cheekbone and eye socket, as well as the bite mark on her nose is indicative of the level of brutality associated with this attack.""

13His Honour characterised the two offences of sexual intercourse without consent as follows:

""[These] followed on from when the offender followed her into her bedroom. No doubt at this time the victim had suffered considerable trauma and was very vulnerable. Each act involved a forceful digital penetration followed by the gratuitous act of wiping his fingers on the complainant's face. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these acts were calculated to degrade, demean and dehumanise her. Each act of sexual assault was separated by a period of approximately one hour during which he continued to threaten her. The verbal and physical abuse continued on after the Form 1 offence and into the next morning.""

14His Honour noted as an aggravating factor that the applicant was on a s12 good behaviour bond at the time of the offences. This bond was imposed because the applicant was convicted of assaulting the complainant's son, causing a wound to the bottom lip which required seven stitches.

15His Honour rejected the submission that the sexual assaults were less serious because they were of relatively short duration. In that regard, his Honour noted that although the act itself might have been of short duration, the same could not be said of the humiliation that accompanied it. His Honour also rejected the submission that digital penetration was less serious than penile penetration. By reference to the particular facts, his Honour said:

""In assessing the accused's criminal culpability it matters little that the assaults would not seem to have been driven by a need for sexual gratification. Having regard to the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation I am more than satisfied that these are objectively very serious offences.""

16His Honour reviewed the applicant's subjective case. At the time of sentence he was aged 42 and had a criminal record which included convictions for matters of violence, including serious personal violence and domestic violence. His Honour concluded that the applicant's criminal record deprived him of leniency so that more weight should be given to retribution, deterrence and protection of the community. 

17By reference to the pre-sentence report, his Honour noted that despite community service orders, periodic detention, recognisance orders, periods of incarceration and good behaviour bonds, the applicant's response to supervision had generally been substandard and in most instances, had resulted in breaches and revocation of the orders. Domestic violence, drug and alcohol use were identified as major problems and it was thought that the applicant had limited insight into his offending behaviour.

18His Honour referred to a report of Mr Champion, psychologist. This revealed that the applicant had a stable and supportive upbringing and that he had trained as a foundry moulder. He had worked in that trade until his mid to late twenties. Thereafter, his employment history had been marred by periods of significant unemployment due to his alcohol use, loss of licence and periods in custody. 

19The psychologist's report described a long and extensive history of alcohol and cannabis use. Alcohol use had increased in 1998 after his father died. The applicant indicated that alcohol had impacted on every aspect of his life for the previous 20 years.

20The applicant told the probation officer and the psychologist that he had no recollection of the assaults. His Honour was not prepared to accept that assertion. His Honour doubted whether the applicant was genuinely remorseful. The probation officer thought that he displayed an attitude which placed a level of blame on the victim whereas the psychologist thought that there was some expression of remorse. Both the probation officer and the psychologist agreed that unless the applicant gained control over his substance abuse, the risk of further violence was most likely. His Honour concluded that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were problematic at best.

21His Honour made specific reference to the Form 1 matter and noted the observations of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [18] where he said:

""18 A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. ...

22His Honour quoted from the observations of Wood CJ at CL in R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436; 125 A Crim R 551 at [41]:

""... Such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.""

23In conclusion his Honour took into account the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as important guideposts. He said:

""The courts have repeatedly emphasised that violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated with real seriousness. Important factors in sentencing where domestic violence is involved are specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and protection of the community. ...""

The applicant received a discount on sentence of 15 percent for his plea of guilty.

Submissions and consideration

24The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed for the s61I offence was unreasonable and plainly unjust. He relied upon the oft quoted passage from Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 where Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said:

""6 Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. It is not a statement of reasons for arriving at the conclusion. A Court of Criminal Appeal is not obliged to employ any particular verbal formula so long as the substance of its conclusions and its reasons is made plain. The degree of elaboration that is appropriate or possible will vary from case to case.""

25By reference to those principles, the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in not making a more precise assessment of where in the range of objective seriousness this offence lay. He submitted that this was necessary because a standard non-parole period applied to count 2. In that regard, the applicant relied upon R v Stewart [2012] NSWCCA 183.

26This submission should not be accepted. In its terms it is similar to the approach deprecated by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 where the Court said:

""28 Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period. ... 

29 ... The reference in s 54B(4) to ""mak[ing] a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period"" is not to be understood as suggesting either the need to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period, or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending. ...""

27His Honour did all that was required of him by assessing both offences as being ""objectively very serious offences"" (ROS 6.1).

28The applicant submitted that a relevant consideration was the short duration of the intercourse and that it was digital intercourse, as distinct from penile intercourse. In that regard, the applicant relied upon MH v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 230 where RS Hulme J (with whom Hoeben J and Campbell J agreed) said:

""41 I agree with his Honour that a continuation of an offence for a longer period will tend to add to the seriousness of the offending. I also agree that an offence involving intercourse is committed however short that intercourse may be. However if his Honour intended to suggest that the shortness of the intercourse is not a factor that argues for a lesser rather than a greater penalty, I disagree. One situation is but the converse of the other and if a longer period tends to add to the seriousness of offending, it follows as the night the day, that a shorter period argues for regarding the offending as less serious than it would have been if continued for longer.

42 The recent decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [60] confirms that the circumstance that an offence is of short duration is a relevant factor.""

29The applicant also relied upon a further observation by RS Hulme J in MH v Regina as follows:

""37 ... Inherently penile vaginal intercourse carries risks or greater risks of venereal disease and pregnancy compared with digital vaginal intercourse. To my mind, and I venture to say in the view of most of the community, penile vaginal intercourse is also a greater affront both physically and mentally to an unwilling victim in consequence of the greater subjugation of her body and intrusion of privacy that such intercourse generally involves. ...

...

39 ... In saying what I have in the two immediately preceding paragraphs, I do not, of course, purport to lay down any proposition of law. Nor do I mean to suggest that all cases of penile intercourse are worse than all cases of digital intercourse. ...""

30Those submissions should not be accepted. The objective seriousness of sexual offences depends on all the circumstances of the case. It is not confined to the nature of the act committed by the offender. While the form of intercourse can be an important factor, it is not to be regarded as the sole consideration. Also important in assessing the objective seriousness are the degree of violence, the physical hurt inflicted, the form of the forced intercourse, any circumstances of humiliation and the duration of the offence. 

31In this case although the ""act of intercourse"" looked at in isolation could be described as of short duration, it has to be looked in the context in which it occurred. It occurred following a severe physical beating inflicted by the applicant upon the complainant. It was accompanied by threats and other conduct designed to humiliate and degrade her. Within an hour a similar episode of offending occurred, accompanied by the same behaviour intended to humiliate her.

32It follows that on the facts of this case that it would be quite inappropriate to look at the acts of intercourse in isolation without having full regard to the surrounding context and circumstances. Those surrounding circumstances were such as to make the duration of the acts of intercourse largely irrelevant. The important matter was the context in which they occurred.

33On the facts of this case a discussion of whether digital intercourse was more or less serious than penile intercourse is quite unproductive. What needs to be understood and which was clearly appreciated by the sentencing judge, is that there was no element of sexual gratification in the conduct of the applicant. What he was doing was demonstrating his domination and power over the complainant. The contemptuous wiping of his fingers on the complainant's face was intended not only to degrade and humiliate her, but to emphasise her subservient position to him. Looked at in their proper context, these offences of sexual intercourse involved substantial violence. In that regard, they were appropriately treated by his Honour.

34The significance, if any, of a difference between digital and penile intercourse was considered by this Court in Doe v R [2013] NSW CCA 248. There Bellew J (with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreed), having extensively reviewed the authorities, concluded:

""54 To the extent that the submissions of counsel for the applicant suggested otherwise, it should be emphasised that there is no decision of this Court which supports the proposition that digital sexual intercourse is, of itself, less serious than some other form of forced sexual intercourse. Reference to the above authorities demonstrates that it has been emphasised, on more than one occasion, that the objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question. Concentrating upon, or giving primary significance to, the form of the forced sexual intercourse in determining its objective seriousness reflects an erroneous approach. It is equally erroneous to attempt to rank forms of forced sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness.""

35Apart from the aggravating features, to which reference has already been made, there were others which the sentencing judge correctly took into account. The applicant had a lengthy record of previous convictions, including other domestic violence offences. The offence was committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty. The offence was committed within a context of domestic violence. In such matters specific and general deterrence are of great importance as are denunciation and the protection of the community - R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436; 125 A Crim R 551 at [41]; R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at [65], R v Kentwell [2013] NSWCCA 266 at [88].

36The fact of the applicant's intoxication does not assist him. In GWM v R [2012] NSWCCA 240 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed) observed that where an offender in a sexual assault case was a heavy user of alcohol for whom inebriation was a common state, intoxication will generally not serve to mitigate penalty (at [83]). That reflects the approach consistently followed by this Court.

37Finally, the Form 1 offence was another sexual assault of equal severity to that for which the applicant was being sentenced. His Honour was entitled to make the sentence for Count 2 longer than it might otherwise have been in order to take into account the need for deterrence and retribution in respect of the offence charged and the greater need for personal deterrence and retribution in respect of that offence: Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 per Bathurst CJ (Hoeben CJ at CL, Garling and Campbell JJ agreeing).

38The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed was inconsistent with the Judicial Commission's statistics in relation to offences under s61I. He submitted that this offence was towards the top of the statistical range and that only 7 percent of the 208 cases on the Judicial Commission database involved sentences greater than that which was imposed in this case.

39What the statistics fail to disclose are the aggravating factors which were or were not present in those cases. They do not disclose the particular factors, nor what discounts were applied. Here, not only were there significant aggravating factors but there was the Form 1 offence which given its nature, substantially influenced the length of the sentence imposed.

40As was pointed out by the Crown in submissions, the whole concept of an ""available range"" of sentencing has recently been considered by the High Court in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirillo v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 where the majority (French CJ; Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:

""28 Despite the frequency with which reference is made in reasons for judgment disposing of sentencing appeals to an ""available range"" of sentences, stating the bounds of an ""available range"" of sentences is apt to mislead. The conclusion that an error has (or has not) been made neither permits nor requires setting the bounds of the range of sentences within which the sentence should (or could) have fallen. If a sentence passed at first instance is set aside as manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate, the sentencing discretion must be re-exercised and a different sentence fixed. Fixing that different sentence neither permits nor requires the re-sentencing court to determine the bounds of the range within which the sentence should fall. 

...

40 The setting of bounds to the available range of sentences in a particular case must, however, be distinguished from the proper and ordinary use of sentencing statistics and other material indicating what sentences have been imposed in other (more or less) comparable cases. Consistency of sentencing is important. But the consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not numerical equivalence.

41 As the plurality pointed out in Hili v The Queen, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect. ..."" 

41The statistics referred to by the applicant are of little value given the particular circumstances of this case. The s61I offence under consideration was one demonstrating considerable violence in which the applicant sought to dominate and degrade the complainant. That this occurred within a domestic relationship made considerations of general deterrence of particular importance. This case depends very much upon its own particular facts.

42For the reasons set out, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed for Count 2 was manifestly excessive in the sense that it was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". It follows that this ground of appeal has not been made out.

43The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

44ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

45R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2763379,Schneider v R [2014] NSWDC 131,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On Anzac day last year two inspectors went into licensed premises in Byron Bay. They were acting under cover. They ordered alcohol and drank it and then left. The following day they went back and did something similar. It was alleged against Mr Schneider, being the licensee of the establishment, that he had committed two offences by selling alcohol not in terms of his licence. The two inspectors did not order a meal or consume a meal nor were they residential guests of the establishment. 

2The matter could have been dealt with by way of a penalty notice but a solicitor acting on behalf of Mr Schneider made an election that the matter proceed to a hearing in the Local Court. In the Local Court pleas of guilty were entered and ultimately Mr Schneider was fined having two convictions recorded against him. The matter has now come before me because Mr Schneider seeks leave to withdraw his plea of guilty and have the matter remitted to the Local Court for entry of a not guilty plea and a determination of his guilt. 

3The principles governing the circumspection by which judicial officers who treat applications of this kind are well known. There is a considerable interest in finality of legal proceedings, including criminal proceedings, even if, as is suggested in this case, the pleas of guilty were entered in the hope of a favourable outcome. The fact that there is an unfavourable outcome does not entitle someone to go back and try an alternative approach.

4In this case it is known that Mr Schneider was an applicant for a different form of liquor license one which would have enabled him to sell more alcohol. Mr Schneider had some trouble accepting that in the witness box today, suggesting he might sell less food but I had little trouble finding that one of the reasons which motivated the application for the new licence was so that more money could be made. 

5It has been suggested that because of that further application the pleas of guilty were entered as part of a conciliatory approach with the expectation being that s 10's would be imposed, in particular because of Mr Schneider's absence of previous convictions.

6Mr Hearnden suggests that the decision to enter pleas of guilty was a deliberate decision in an attempt to get s 10's and disappointment that that was not the outcome does not justify Mr Schneider getting an opportunity to present a completely different case in the Local Court. 

7I however have grave doubts, indeed sufficient doubts such that I will allow these applications, that Mr Schneider ever understood precisely what was happening. He gave evidence in court today that he did not even understand what a s 10 was. No other material in evidence would contradict him. There is nothing to suggest that the somewhat strange concepts of a matter being found proved but no conviction recorded was ever explained to him, nor, and this is perhaps the most important feature of the evidence, does it appear that the solicitors then appearing for Mr Schneider ever explained to him the elements of the offences to which he was pleading guilty. Indeed there is evidence to suggest that immediately before the sentencing hearing Mr Schneider was indicating that he believed he was not guilty to at least one of the offences.

8Evidence from the solicitor was put before me today by way of affidavit. It is brief, there is no suggestion that any issues of legal professional privilege have prevented him from providing evidence as to what advice he gave his client before those pleas of guilty were entered, so in those circumstances the absence of any evidence regarding discussions between Mr Schneider and Mr Maxwell is noteworthy. The position clearly is that Mr Schneider was, at least as far as one of the charges is concerned, suggesting that he had not breached the terms of his licence, yet this was apparently ignored by Mr Maxwell, who does not appear to have engaged in any consideration of any defence to the second charge. Mitigating features were not even presented to the Local Court on sentence. 

9Of course everything I have said about Mr Maxwell's conduct has to be considered on this basis, Mr Maxwell does not appear before me and so any criticisms I appear to have made of him have to be looked at in that light, but with that qualification on the evidence before me I am not satisfied that he ever obtained proper instructions from Mr Schneider such that Mr Schneider's pleas of guilty were genuine acknowledgements of his guilt to these two offences.

10I repeat something I said earlier. Even those professing their innocence are entitled to plead guilty and when they get an outcome they do not like it is not always the case that they will be allowed to withdraw those pleas of guilty. But one matter that I must consider in determining whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred such that the application to withdraw the pleas of guilty should be granted is a consideration as to whether any instructions given by Mr Schneider to Mr Maxwell and any advice given by Mr Maxwell to Mr Schneider meant that the pleas of guilty were genuine acknowledgements of Mr Schneider's guilt. I do not think they were. I think they were simply Mr Schneider accepting Mr Maxwell's advice without that advice including consideration of exactly what it was that Mr Schneider was admitting to. 

11In those circumstances I am not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that Mr Schneider, in effect, be bound by his pleas of guilty. There are, it seems, real issues to be determined in this matter. Of course it would have been better if they were determined in the Local Court but from what I can see Mr Schneider was alerting Mr Maxwell to those issues. One issue which will arise in relation to the first matter is whether alcohol was served under an honest and reasonable mistake of fact that the two inspectors were either ordering alcohol as part of a meal or were guests of the hotel. I am told that there is CCTV footage showing a number of patrons of the establishment being served food and eating it, which is in contrast to the statement of facts prepared by the prosecutor and tendered in the Local Court. 

12The flavour of the statement of facts in the Local Court suggests, and indeed this is the description used in the facts, that the place operated as a pub rather than a restaurant, if that were the case then the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact that the barmen thought the inspectors were going to consume food would be unlikely to succeed. But if ordering and eating food was common place that evening such a defence is much more likely to succeed. As far as the second matter is concerned I understand that there is a real issue, at least in terms of the law as to whether a guest of a guest would be entitled to be served alcohol without a meal. These issues appear not to have been addressed by Mr Maxwell and led to Mr Schneider entering pleas of guilty in circumstances where, had he been given proper advice, it is likely that he would not have entered those pleas.

13Mr Hearnden made much of the suggestion that the pleas were entered as part of a conciliatory approach to get the extended licence. There is a lot in what he says as to why such an attitude might have been taken, but if that attitude flowed from inadequate consideration as to whether Mr Schneider was guilty in the first place then I do not consider that it is in the interests of justice that Mr Schneider be denied the opportunity to argue that he was not guilty of these offences. 

14The application to withdraw the pleas of guilty is allowed and the matter will be remitted to the Local Court for further hearing.

15I remit the matter to the Local Court at Ballina on a date to be fixed. In the event that there needs to be any further order to achieve the matter going back to the Local Court the parties can approach me and I'll make the further order.

16In accordance with the order I've made I'll quash the convictions.

		19 August 2014",2014-03-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763391,Tay v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 53,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  This is an application brought by Joseph Tay in respect of proceedings instituted in the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court with respect to a judgment of the District Court.
2In the District Court there were matters arising out of convictions for traffic offences which convictions were imposed in the Local Court.  One of the consequences of the convictions of Mr Tay was that his licence was suspended and a period of disqualification imposed which ran from 5 August 2013 until 4 August 2014.
3Following his appeal to the District Court he had no further right of appeal.  Nevertheless, he sought to commence proceedings in this Court, which are presently pending.
4The question is whether the effect of commencing proceedings for judicial review, an event which occurred on 29 November 2013, is an automatic stay of the suspension of his licence.  If there were a stay, then there is no call for an order of this Court imposing such a stay.  Indeed it would be both unnecessary and inappropriate to do so.  If there were no automatic stay, a real question would arise as to whether this Court should now impose a stay and as to whether it should (and could) be backdated to the date on which the proceedings in this Court were commenced.  The reason for seeking to have it effective from an earlier point in time is that Mr Tay continued to drive and was stopped on 28 February 2014, as a result of which a further court attendance notice was issued for driving whilst disqualified.
5The matter turns on the operation of s 69C of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), the relevant provisions of which presently state:
69C Stay of execution of conviction, order or sentence pending review
(1) This section and section 69D apply to proceedings in the Court for judicial review of a determination made by the District Court in appeal proceedings relating to a conviction or order made by the Local Court (or part of such a conviction or order) or sentence imposed by the Local Court.
(2) The execution of a sentence imposed as a consequence of a conviction, or of any other order, is stayed when proceedings seeking judicial review are commenced.
...
(5) Despite subsection (2), any period during which the stay is in force is not to be taken into account when calculating the length of a period of disqualification from holding a driver licence resulting from a conviction under the road transport legislation within the meaning of the Road Transport Act 2013.
6The question accordingly is whether the disqualification is part of the sentence so that the licence suspension is automatically stayed when the proceedings for judicial review were commenced.  That there may be some such result is implied by subs (5), because it refers to the effects of a calculation of a period of disqualification and the effect on it of ""the stay"", apparently a reference to the stay imposed by subs (2).
7In Roads and Traffic Authority v Higginson [2011] NSWCA 151, this Court was required to consider the operation of a number of similar provisions, both in the road transport legislation and in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""Appeal and Review Act"").  In particular, it was required to consider the operation of a stay of execution of sentence under s 63 of that Act and the power of a court on an appeal to vary that effect under s 68.
8For present purposes it is sufficient to note that prior to the commencement of the Appeal and Review Act, the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) contained a provision which was in very similar wording to that which is now found in s 69C(2) and (5) of the Supreme Court Act.  In fact, the wording of subs (4) of s 127 was relevantly identical.  In Higginson, it was accepted that the effect of the stays imposed under the Appeal and Review Act (and previously under the Justices Act), had the effect of suspending the disqualification from holding a driver's licence.
9Accordingly, it is appropriate to accept that the virtually identical provisions in s 69C, should be understood to have the same effect.  The consequence is that upon Mr Tay commencing proceedings for judicial review of the District Court judgment, his licence suspension was automatically stayed.  Because the statutory stay appears not to have found its way into the police records, with the result that he was stopped again for driving whilst disqualified in February of this year, it is appropriate that the Court make a declaration to the following effect; namely that, so far as his disqualification which formed the basis of the further offence on 28 February 2014 depended upon a judgment of the District Court made on 21 November 2013, which is the subject of the proceedings in this Court, the effect of s 69C is to stay the suspension of his driver licence.  That will no doubt have consequences for the proceedings which are pending in the Local Court.
10The only order I think I need make at the present stage is to declare that consequence.  I do so conscious of the fact that a declaration is usually a final order, but it is nevertheless an interlocutory order in this case because it refers to the effect of a stay pending determination of the proceedings in this Court.  The statute reflects the order which might otherwise be made by this Court: it does not dispose of the proceedings: cf Supreme Court Act, s 46(2)(b).  No objection is taken to me (sitting alone) making an order in this form.  Accordingly, I make the following declaration.
The effect of the proceedings commenced under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act in respect of the judgment of the District Court delivered on 21 November 2013, is to stay the operation of the order that the applicant, Joseph Tay, is disqualified from holding a driver licence until 4 August 2014.

		12 March 2014",2014-03-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2763405,R v Kerry Forrest [2014] NSWSC 1684,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR:  The accused, Ms Forrest, seeks a trial by judge alone, to which the Crown prosecutor does not consent. The application is based upon the state of her health. The background to the matter, and the evidence concerning her health, is to be found in my judgment of 9 May 2013, refusing a permanent stay: R v Forrest [2013] NSWSC 527.

2There is no doubt that Ms Forrest is seriously ill. Mr Ainsworth, who is now her counsel, argues that the effects of her illness would cause her prejudice in the eyes of a jury and the practical effects of her condition would affect the progress of the trial in such a way as to impose an unreasonable burden upon a jury.

3I do not have up-to-date medical evidence due, as I understand it, to the limitation of legal aid funding. However, from the evidence summarised in my judgment last year one would not expect any improvement. What is at issue at present are the practical difficulties presented by Ms Forrest's condition in her attendance for trial. These have been explained in an informal manner, largely by Mr Ainsworth's submissions from the bar table. However, I am content to accept the material in that way, given that they have been based upon instructions and observations conveyed to him by his instructing solicitor, Ms Hearne, who has had extensive contact with Ms Forrest over a considerable period of time.

4As a result of her tumour and the treatment for it, Ms Forrest is prone to urinary and bowel discomfort. Her diet is limited, and after she has eaten it is necessary for her to go to the toilet, a process which might take half an hour or more. She is also prone to bleeding because she is on blood thinning medication and her tumour is near her bladder and her ureter. These are problems which she faces after breakfast but, more importantly, would also face after lunch at court. 

5Lunch at court is provided by the Department of Corrective Services. It is sandwiches, which she cannot eat. She can eat soup, which the department would not provide but which could be obtained for her by her legal representatives. This is hardly a satisfactory situation but, I suppose, it is manageable. It would not solve the toileting problem. 

6She needs a variety of medication, including for nausea, during the day but arrangements would be in place for her medication to be brought with her to court each day and be available to her as required.

7Her transport to court is a problem. She is in a wheelchair and vehicles which accommodate a wheelchair are available. However, in those vehicles she travels in the wheelchair with a lap seatbelt but this does not cushion her from the movement of the vehicle. Bouncing or bumping in the course of the journey affects her tumour, causing her pain and discomfort, so that she is likely to feel unwell upon her arrival. There appears to be no solution to this problem. She has sometimes travelled in a Tarago used by the prison hospital, where she is removed from the wheelchair and travels on a normal seat, which does cushion her from the vehicle's movement. However, that vehicle is not part of the Corrective Services' fleet and would not generally be available to transport her to and from court.

8In court she sits in a wheelchair, mostly with her head bowed, clearly looking unwell. I accept that she cannot remain in the courtroom for long periods and that regular breaks would be required. It may be, as Mr Ainsworth foreshadowed, that she may not be able to endure afternoon sessions. 

9What emerges from all this is that the hours the court could sit during this trial are likely to vary from day to day, and there could not be a reliable estimate of the length of the trial. The present estimate is 4 to 5 weeks if more or less normal hours can be maintained, but that is unpredictable.

10Mr Ainsworth submitted that a jury would have difficulty coping with a ""stop-start"" progress of the trial. He expressed concern about how a jury might react to Ms Forrest's somewhat distressing appearance in court. He also argued that she might have difficulty in giving evidence, if she chose to take that course, for the reasons which I considered in my earlier judgment, noting that expert evidence might have to be called about that matter. The combination of these factors, he submitted, demonstrates that it is in the interests of justice that the trial proceed without a jury.

11The Crown prosecutor submitted that all these difficulties could be accommodated in a jury trial. The jury could be told that Ms Forrest has cancer, that that condition explains her appearance in court, and that because of that condition it would be necessary to take regular breaks and sit for shorter than the usual hours. It could also be explained that there might be unexpected interruptions to the progress of trial because of her illness. Far from being prejudiced against her by these matters, he argued, the jury would be likely to look upon her with sympathy. He added that these difficulties could be explained to the jury panel at the outset, so that they understood that a 4 to 5 week estimate might not be reliable, and any applications by prospective jurors to be excused for that reason could be dealt with.

12The Crown prosecutor questioned the foreshadowed difficulty of Ms Forrest giving evidence, as he had in the proceedings for a permanent stay. It is true, as I observed in my judgment at [38], that on that occasion she was able to give evidence well enough. However, it is fair to observe that that evidence was relatively brief and that giving evidence in the trial, in a circumstantial case of some complexity, would be a much more demanding task. 

13It is not necessary to set out the relevant statutory provision, s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, nor to refer to authorities on that provision and on like provisions in other jurisdictions. Section 132 was examined in some detail by McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Hislop J and I generally agreed, in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86, 217 A Crim R 1. 

14However, the Crown prosecutor relied upon s 132(5) which, put shortly, provides that an application for trial by judge alone might be refused if the trial involves factual issues requiring assessment by objective community standards. This, he argued, is such a case. While it is a circumstantial case of what the Crown puts as premeditated murder, there are aspects of it calling for examination by the application of community standards. He referred to evidence of Ms Forrest's dishonesty and, in particular, to evidence of behaviour on her part around the time of the death of the deceased and after it pointing towards her guilt. Whether that behaviour might be seen as reasonable in the circumstances, and capable of an innocent explanation, would be a matter appropriately assessed, as he put it in written submissions, ""by a jury of persons with an ordinary experience of life."" He referred to the examination of this issue, albeit in a very different context, by Latham J in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661, noting her Honour's reference to the judgment of Bellew J in R v King [2013] NSWSC 448. 

15I understand that argument, but this is not the occasion to examine the scope of subs (5) and I express no concluded view about it. Generally, the Crown prosecutor's submissions have force and I have not found this matter easy to determine. However, the deciding factor is the uncertain progress of the trial, the matter upon which Mr Ainsworth primarily relies. 

16Certainly, Ms Forrest's state of health will require taking regular breaks and, very likely, sitting shorter hours. More importantly, her condition is likely to vary from day to day and the progress of proceedings each day may be unpredictable. There may be days when she is unable to attend court at all. Jurors would be asked to put aside their weekday routine for a number of weeks with no certainty about how much of each day, if at all, they would be required. In addition, the likely disruptions of the progress of the trial do make it very difficult to estimate how long it might last. All this, in my view, would place an unacceptable burden upon a jury in a trial which is difficult enough as it is. I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that Ms Forrest be tried by judge alone.

17The election for trial by judge alone was filed out of time. However, I grant leave for the application to proceed and direct that the trial be conducted without a jury.

		28 November 2014",2014-03-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763408,State of New South Wales v Baker [2014] NSWSC 699,"Judgment

1The plaintiff by amended summons is seeking an extended supervision order in respect of the defendant pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). On 17 January 2014, Fullerton J made an interim supervision order for a period of 28 days pursuant to ss 10A and 10C of the Act. On 12 February 2014, Campbell J made a further interim supervision order for a period of 28 days. The plaintiff now seeks a renewal of the orders that the defendant be subject to interim supervision for a period of 28 days or until judgment is delivered, whichever is the sooner. The matter is set down for final hearing on 21 March 2014, at which time final orders will be sought. 

2My task is made easier by the fact that the earlier orders were made as I have described. The change, however, being that I now have the benefit of two psychiatric reports which were made pursuant to the orders of Fullerton J. They confirm the appropriateness of the orders made by Fullerton J and Campbell J, and provide an adequate basis for my making the supervision order sought. 

3I should mention that, perhaps not surprisingly, the making of the present interim order is not opposed. Nevertheless, it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that such an order is appropriate. 

4The defendant was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and sentenced on 5 April 2000 to 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. He was released to parole on 4 June 2012 and his parole ended on 17 January 2014. It follows that the defendant is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 of the Act. 

5Section 10A of the Act provides that an interim supervision order may be made by the Court if it is satisfied that the defendant's current custody will expire before the proceedings are to be determined and that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order. The decision to make an interim supervision order is discretionary, and it is open for the Court to refuse to make such an order even if the conditions specified in the relevant section are satisfied. I have mentioned that Fullerton J and Campbell J made orders, and thus were satisfied that the requirements of the Act were established. 

6The defendant's sentence ended on 17 January 2014 and since that date he has been subject to interim supervision orders, so that he continues to be a supervised sex offender within the meaning of s 5I and therefore the present application may be considered. 

7The current supervision order expires on 14 March 2014, and if a further order is not made supervision of the defendant will expire before the final hearing. In that event the defendant would not be a supervised sex offender and an application for an extended supervision order cannot be made. The renewal of the interim supervision order sought is capable of being made as it does not exceed the time period allowed, being three months in total, under s 10C(2) of the Act. 

8It is not necessary for present purposes to predict the ultimate result of the proceedings; merely to find prima facie that the matters alleged, if proved, justify the making of the final extended supervision order. Amongst other things, it does not involve the weighing up of documentation or the consideration of evidence which will be called at the final hearing. 

9It is necessary before a high risk sex offender extended supervision order is made that the Court be satisfied that the offender is a ""high risk sex offender"" within the meaning of s 5B of the Act. Section 5B provides - 

""(2) An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision."" [Emphasis original].

10The meaning of the important element of the definition that there be a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk has been considered, amongst others, by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220. Essentially it involves a balancing exercise between the likelihood of the commission of a serious sex offence by the defendant, on the one hand, and, on the other, serious consequences for him by way of significant limitations on his freedom as a citizen. These requirements are relevant also to the making of an interim order. 

11The Act specifies the matters to which the Court must have regard when considering whether to make an extended supervision order, see s 9(3). These include the safety of the community; the reports of the psychiatrists and other persons appointed to conduct examinations of the offender; the results of assessments; the results of statistical analysis; reports prepared by Corrective Services New South Wales; the outcome of treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has been involved; his level of compliance with parole obligations, or any earlier extended supervision order, or any other obligations to which he or she has been subject; his criminal history; the views of the sentencing court at the time of his being sentenced; and other information that pertains to the likelihood of future offending. 

12I do not intend, and it is not necessary for present purposes, to detail the criminal history and patterns of offending behaviour of the defendant. It is enough to say that I have read the material which is relied on by the plaintiff in that regard. He has a lengthy criminal record. He has committed serious sexual offences against five victims, as well as offences against seven other victims. These offences were committed against victims aged between 14 and 26, each victim being a female who did not know him. These offences were committed in the period between 1972 to 1974, 1981, 1986 and 1998. He was sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment on each occasion. Some of the offences were committed whilst he was on parole for other sexual offences. 

13Two court appointed psychiatrists, Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Jeremy O'Dea, have diagnosed him with sexual sadism disorder and have concluded that he has a high risk of committing a further serious sexual offence if he is not kept under supervision. 

14The risk reports provided by the Department of Corrective Services, prepared by psychologists with the department, confirm the risk which the offender represents, and describe the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community. 

15When the defendant was sentenced on 5 April 2000 to 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years on one count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent the sentencing judge said:

""the repeated pattern of similar sexual offences of great seriousness and committed by the [defendant] over a period of twenty-five years clearly indicates the primary function I have to perform is to protect the female members of the public from him principally removing him from society, that period cannot be other than a very lengthy one. The protection of the community requires it and the seriousness of the offence demands it....

There can be no doubt that the prisoner presents a danger to females alone on streets and may well do so for the rest of his life unless he continues to receive treatment for a very considerable period.

...

[T]he offence is so grave and danger [the defendant] poses to the community is so significant and his risk of re-offending is so high, that this factor seems to be a matter which ... can only be reflected if at all in the determination of whether he should be able to be released before the expiration of that sentence.""

16I have mentioned the other reports, but I do not propose to set out their conclusions. It is enough to say they show that the making of the orders to which no objection is taken is entirely justified. 

17I should mention, of course, that a supervision order is in no sense punishment. It is designed, so far as it may reasonably do so, bearing in mind the civil rights of all citizens, including the defendant, to protect the community from the risk of further serious offences being committed by him who has demonstrated in the most direct way the tendency to commit such offences. 

18I am satisfied in the present case from the material provided and the reports supplied that the matters alleged, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make the further order subject to the conditions pursuant to the schedule attached to the short minutes of order. 

19Accordingly, I make the orders set out in the short minutes of order signed by me, dated today and placed with the papers.

2763416,"GIALLOMBARDO, Peter v R [2014] NSWCCA 25","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.

2BLANCH J: I agree with Hall J.

3HALL J: Peter Giallombardo, to whom I shall refer as ""the Appellant"", stood for trial commencing on 6 February 2012 in the District Court of NSW before his Honour Judge Bennett and a jury of twelve.

4The Appellant was arraigned upon indictment in respect of the following charges in relation to which he entered not guilty pleas:

Count 1: On or about 9 July 2010, at Blacktown in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], and at the time of that assault, committed an act of indecency on [the complainant], she being a person with a serious physical disability.

Count 2: On or about 9 July 2010, at Blacktown in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant], and at the time of that assault, committed an act of indecency on [the complainant], she being a person with a serious physical disability.

Count 3: On or about 9 July 2010, at Blacktown in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the complainant] and at the time of that assault, committed an act of indecency on [the complainant], she being a person with a serious physical disability.

Count 4: On or about 9 July 2010, at Blacktown in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], without the consent of [the complainant], knowing she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that [the complainant] was a person with a serious physical disability.

5At the trial, the Appellant instructed Mr Velcic, solicitor, and was represented by Mr Martin of counsel.

6The trial concluded on 14 February 2012. The jury returned guilty verdicts in relation to Counts 1, 2 and 3, and a not guilty verdict in relation to Count 4 and its statutory alternative. A verdict of guilty was returned to the common law alternative charge on Count 4, being an offence in the same terms as those charged in respect of Counts 1 to 3.

7The Appellant was sentenced on 24 April 2012. An aggregate sentence of 2 years imprisonment pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was imposed, with a single non-parole period of 1 year. A finding of special circumstances was made. The non-parole period expired on 23 April 2013 and the Appellant was admitted to parole on that date. The overall sentence expires on 23 April 2014.

8On 26 April 2012, a Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on behalf of the Appellant. On 3 December 2012, a Notice of Appeal together with Grounds of Appeal were filed.

Grounds of Appeal

9The Grounds of Appeal set out in the Notice of Appeal are in the following terms:

(1) The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

(2) The trial judge erred in failing to adequately warn the jury that the prosecution case relied wholly on the evidence of the complainant.

(3) The absence of both evidence of good character and directions on good character occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

10On the hearing of the appeal in this Court, Mr T Game SC with Mr D Barrow of counsel, appeared on behalf of the Appellant. The Court had the benefit of detailed written submissions on behalf of the appellant dated 29 November 2012 in support of the grounds of the appeal.

11The Crown filed a document, ""Crown Submissions Part A - Summary of Trial"" (""Summary of Trial"") on 9 August 2013. The Crown also relied upon written submissions dated 5 August 2013. 

12Ground 1 of the appeal requires a detailed examination of the evidence adduced at trial. I set out below relevant factual matters as conveniently summarised at [7]-[21] of the Crown's Summary of Trial:

""7. Due to a stroke suffered at birth the Complainant suffers from cerebral palsy and the side effect dysarthria, which affects her ability to communicate verbally. The Complainant, however, is able to communicate verbally with her sister, [SP], including by talking on the phone. [SP] understands the Complainant's speech, having grown up together [Complainant T4].

8. The Complainant commenced learning sign language at TAFE in 2009, which studies are ongoing [Complainant T5].

9. The Complainant has weak nerves due to the stroke, making it difficult for her to close her mouth fully [Complainant T6].

10. Due to a series of three operations aiming to improve her ability to speak with the assistance of a speech therapist, the Complainant has been in receipt of a Commonwealth disability pension for one year. Following the operations the complainant struggled with saliva control, but she has since regained control of this. Her saliva control in 2010, the year she met the Appellant, was 'fine' [Complainant T6-7].

11. A statement of agreed facts regarding the Complainant's physical disability was tendered at the trial as Exhibit L. It was agreed that the Complainant suffers from cerebral palsy and that throughout the course of her life she has been treated by various medical specialists for 'velopharyngal insufficiency' (escape of air into the nasal passage) and 'global dysarthria' (difficulties articulating speech, sometimes referred to as slurring of speech). It was agreed that the Complainant's verbal communication impairment since early childhood has been severe to profound. A neurologist reported that the Complainant is unable to close her mouth, resulting in leakage and dribbling of saliva, very little movement of the tongue and reduced movement of the lips and palate. The surgeries that the Complainant underwent [in late 2009, late 2010 and April 2011] were not performed to treat her problem with excess saliva and had no impact on that problem.

12. In cross-examination, the Complainant accepted that in text messages prior to the Appellant's visit on 10 July 2010 [Exhibit C], she referred to having the flu such that 'I can't use my voice, the doctor said I need to rest it' and 'I can't communicate with you. My voice is gone basically'; the Complainant said that she 'wanted [the Appellant] to understand that there would be no communication when I'm ill ... it's very hard to communicate when I'm ill'. The Complainant agreed that there is a difference between having a permanent problem with communications and speech and having a temporary problem due to a sore throat, however 'I said I have speech problems' to the Appellant over the internet before she knew that they were cousins. The Complainant agreed that telephone records [Exhibits B and C] show that the Appellant attempted to call her on the phone as if he could speak to her, but denied that this was because she never told him that she had speech problems: 'No, I said on the computer. Perhaps he didn't know how bad it was. Some people when I say I have speech problems will still phone me'. It was put to the Complainant that in examination in chief she said that [she] told the Appellant she had 'communication' problems rather than 'speech' problems, to which the Complainant replied that it was 'speech problems I said to him ... Not communication. Perhaps that might have been an interpreter error'. The Complainant denied that throughout the entire time of her dealings with the Appellant, she never told him that she had speech problems [Complainant T70-71, 152].

13. The Complainant denied in cross-examination that in their communication over the internet, the Appellant did not say anything about sex. Rather, he 'just said that you looked hot and he wanted to kiss you or was dreaming about kissing you'. The Complainant maintained that the Appellant mentioned wanting to have sex with her, but clarified that he did not continue to do so after he became aware that they were related [Complainant T71, 73].

14. The Complainant accepted in cross-examination that when the Appellant sent her a text message on 6 July 2010 that they could be 'kissing cousins' the message including punctuation marks signifying a smiley face with a wink and that her response to it was 'LOL [laugh out loud] u can't have the hots for me we related and you still want to kiss me LOL'. The Appellant replied, 'Why not? I'll pretend I still don't know hehe' [Exhibit C]. When it was put to her that she replied using 'laugh out loud' because she understood the winking smiley face to indicate a joke, the Complainant responded, 'I don't know, I can't remember what I was thinking. I think it's weird, very weird ...because we're related' [Complainant T72-74].

15. The Complainant accepted in cross-examination that when the Appellant sent her a text message on 7 July 2010 asking, 'Can we lay and hug?' she replied, 'Oh Pete there are millions of girls you can hug and kiss, but cause we're related that will be weird of us. You can hug me but we need to respect that we do share the same family. We can get to know each other as friends, even cousins'. The Appellant maintained that he was 'still curious about kissing you' and that 'I just want to kiss you and now I know you're my cousin it kind of is naughty so it would be good excitement'. The Appellant also told the Complainant, 'I imagine kissing you now and I've had naughty thoughts before about a cousin'. The Complainant agreed with the proposition put to her in cross-examination that she knew at that time the sort of thing that was going on in the Appellant's mind [Complainant T74-75; Exhibit C].

16. It was put to the Complainant in cross-examination that prior to informing the Appellant of the family connection on 6 July 2010, they had been in communication by text message as recently as June 2010, pausing after 14 June 2010. The Complainant accepted 'That was when I stopped. Sorry. And I remember that I stopped - all I remember that I didn't like him and I was not interested in sex. I don't know how long I stopped but I stopped. I stopped talking to him. And it was not my intention to contact him again'. The Complainant agreed that she was the one to initiate contact again on 6 July 2010 and to ask if he wanted to meet up, also stating 'I can't kiss you' and 'don't try nothing on me' [Complainant T76; Exhibits B and C].

THE OFFENCES

17. At about 8.30pm on 9 July 2010, there was a knock at the Complainant's door. The Appellant, whom the Complainant recognised from his profile picture on Oasisactive.com, was at the door wearing a baseball cap, black jacket and a black t-shirt. The Complainant was wearing a long sleeved silver top with black pants [Complainant T22, Exhibit A, photographs 3-5].

18. The Complainant led the Appellant to her computer table, where she showed him family photographs and a piece of paper with family details printed on it that accompanied the family DVD [Complainant T23; Exhibit A, photographs 1-2].

19. After returning the piece of paper to the computer table, the Complainant invited the Appellant to her bedroom to choose a DVD to watch. When the Complainant said, 'You pick' the Appellant replied, 'You pick'. The Complainant and the Appellant both spoke and pointed to communicate. The Appellant appeared to understand what the Complainant was saying [Complainant T23].

20. The Complainant selected a movie, The Water Boy, and returned to the lounge room where she and the Appellant sat beside one another on the three seater sofa pictured in Exhibit A, photograph 9. The Complainant sat closest to the television, facing her back towards the Appellant on her right-hand side. They both looked towards the television [Complainant T24]. [Based on the positions of the stick figures depicted in the photograph, it appears that the Complainant meant her left-hand side rather than her right-hand side]

21. About 5 minutes into the movie, the Appellant put his arms around the Complainant and touched her breast area on the outside of her clothing. The Complainant pushed the Appellant's hands away and said, 'No'. The Appellant kissed the Complainant's neck. She moved away from the television and the Appellant grabbed her hand and kissed it. She then typed a text message on the screen of her mobile phone which she showed to the Appellant but did not transmit saying, 'Please don't touch me because we are family'. The Appellant stopped [Complainant T24-25, 59].""

13In his Remarks on Sentence, the trial judge summarised the facts of the offences as follows:

""The offender arrived about 8.30pm on 9 July 2010. The victim showed the offender the DVD with the picture she had found but said in evidence he exhibited little interest. In her lounge room they began to watch the DVD movie they had chosen. They sat on her lounge. The offender placed his arms around her and hugged her and then kissed her neck and touched her breasts. She said 'no' and pulled away from him. He lay across her as she sat on the lounge and rubbed and sucked her breasts. She protested and made an excuse to get up and get a drink from the kitchen. This conduct gave rise to the first count.

She returned to the lounge and the offender took her arm and pulled her down and resumed touching and sucking her breasts. This is the conduct upon which the second count was charged.

The victim told him to stop and created another excuse to separate, representing that she would let her cat in. She went to the front door and then returned to sit on another lounge chair. The film ended and she told the offender to leave. As they approached the front door the offender touched the victim's buttocks, told her she was sexy and touched her breasts again and kissed her on the neck. This is the conduct upon which the third count was charged.

When they were outside near the front door the offender held the victim by her arm and slid his hand down her pants to place his finger against her vagina. He said, 'Let's go to your room'. She refused. This is the conduct upon which the fourth count is charged"": T6-T7, 24 April 2012.

Agreed Facts

14Before turning to the Grounds of Appeal, I note that Exhibit L in the proceedings contained Agreed Facts pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995. That Exhibit established that the complainant was born in early 1987. She was therefore 23 years of age at the time of the offences. The Agreed Facts set out in Exhibit L also established that the complainant suffers from cerebral palsy. It is relevant to the proceedings that brief reference be made to the nature of her disabilities. The complainant has had a severe to profound verbal communication impairment since early childhood. That impairment had affected the range, speed and precision of her oral movements and her ability to close off her hypo-pharynx.

15A speech pathologist had expressed the opinion that the complainant has a profound verbal communication impairment and she relies heavily on communicating in the general community by writing and by sign language (Auslan).

16The complainant also has other forms of physical disability. In particular, medical examinations established that she was unable to close her mouth which results in:

(a) leakage and dribbling of saliva (but in 2010 she could control it);
(b) very little movement of the tongue; and 
(c) reduced movement of the lips and palate. 

17The complainant also had mildly impaired co-ordination of her upper limbs.

Evidence at Trial

18The complainant, as well as her twin sister, gave evidence at trial. 

19The Crown also called police witnesses, Mr Mathew Gillett and Dr Alanah Houston. Dr Houston saw and examined the complainant in the early hours of Saturday, 10 July 2010 at Liverpool Hospital.

20The following documents were tendered prior to the complainant commencing her evidence. 

Exhibit A - a variety of photographs, largely of the complainant's residence and also of her clothing.

Exhibit B - call records between the Appellant's and the complainant's mobile phones.

Exhibit C - text messages between the Appellant's and the complainant's mobile phones.

Exhibit D - call records between the complainant and the police officer Gillett and also between her and her sister (SP).

Exhibit E - text messages between the complainant and the police officer Gillett.

Ground 1 - The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence

21In the written submissions for the Appellant, eight specific complaints were advanced in support of this ground of appeal. It was therein contended that the jury was wrong in accepting the complainant's evidence upon the basis that she was in fact an unreliable and untruthful witness.

22The test to be applied where a ground of appeal asserts that a verdict was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence was enunciated by the High Court in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 as follows:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""

23As the Crown observed in its written submissions, the performance of that task is to be undertaken bearing in mind that the jury is the body entrusted with primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and the jury has had the benefit of having seen the witnesses: M v The Queen, supra, at 493 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at 405-406 per French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ.

24In support of Ground 1, the written submissions of the Appellant set out detailed references to the evidence of the complainant in chief and in cross-examination, in relation to the eight specific complaints. Whilst I do not here reproduce the various dot-point references set out in the written submissions to the evidence in support of the eight complaints, I will refer below to their content in summary form.

25In the Crown's written submissions it was observed that the eight matters relied upon by the Appellant in support of Ground 1 were all very much live issues before the jury. They were all issues that the jury heard submissions about. The jury, the Crown submitted, were accordingly in a position to determine those issues in the atmosphere of the trial, having seen the complainant as she described the events of 9 July 2010, and those that occurred on the days that followed: Crown's Written Submissions at [29].

26The Crown further observed that counsel then appearing for the Appellant at trial relied upon matters the subject of the eight complaints as indicators of the complainant's asserted untruthfulness and unreliability, and invited the jury to consider those matters carefully when reaching its verdict. The Crown's submission was that there is every reason to conclude that the jury did indeed carefully consider those matters, and concluded - contrary to the Appellant's position - that the complainant was an accurate and honest witness in relation to essential matters: Crown's Written Submissions at [30].

The Eight Specific Complaints

(1) The jury did not accept the complainant's evidence about digital penetration of her vagina. Her evidence about this issue was emphatic. She described that it hurt, lasted for five seconds and happened outside on the driveway.

27The complainant gave evidence at trial that the Appellant had digitally penetrated her. However, despite this evidence, the Appellant's submissions contend that she denied penetration when asked about it in a non-leading way by Dr Houston on 10 July 2010.

28The jury provided a note to the trial judge (MFI 19). This was relied upon by the Appellant as material which revealed that the jury did not accept her account. The note said:

""We believe that count 4 is more plausibly indecent assault consistent with counts 1, 2 and 3. We don't have sufficient evidence of intercourse. Is it lawfully possible to alter the indictment on count 4?""

29The submission for the Appellant was that the jury's decision not to accept the complainant's evidence must mean that they had doubts about her veracity.

30Dr Houston at trial was examined in chief in relation to the notes she made of her examination of the complainant. Dr Houston used mime or sign language in communicating with the complainant and sought the assistance from time-to-time of the complainant's sister during the examination. An entry in Dr Houston's notes was to the effect that the complainant did not think that there had been actual penetration: T 238:5-10. In evidence in chief the complainant said that when she was asked by Dr Houston if there had been penetration, the complainant said she did not know what that term comprehended. In later evidence the complainant said that she understood that penetration was limited only to penile/vaginal penetration: T 44:1-20, 7 February 2012.

31In the course of his summing up the trial judge told the jury that they were to bear in mind that Dr Houston did not quote verbatim what she heard the complainant say. His Honour also observed, in response to a question put by him to the doctor, that Dr Houston revealed that she had communicated in evidence what her ""impression"" was of what had been put to her by the complainant. The trial judge reminded the jury that the complainant had communicated to Dr Houston that there was no penetration because she thought it equated to penile/vaginal penetration: Summing Up, T 27, 14 February 2012.

(2) The allegations that the Appellant was asking for sex in the period before they met are inconsistent and unsupported by the evidence.

32This complaint relates to the complainant's evidence that dialogue with the Appellant first commenced in March/April 2010 on the computer and then by way of text messaging (SMS). The complainant had given evidence to the effect that she stopped the contact because, from what the Appellant had said to her, he was too interested in sex.

33In the written submissions for the Appellant, it was noted that there was further text messaging between 3-14 June 2012 between the complainant and the Appellant, well before it became apparent that she and the Appellant were related.

34These claimed inconsistencies, which were the subject of cross-examination and the subject of specific mention in the closing address of counsel for the Appellant, were issues for the jury's consideration.

(3) A number of inconsistencies exist in the complainant's account of what happened between them on the night.

35A number of matters were raised by the Appellant suggesting unreliability in the complainant's evidence. These included her denial that she was wearing a jacket. The jacket, it had been contended by the Appellant, was important having regard to the Appellant's alleged offending actions as described by the complainant in evidence.

36A series of dot-points in the Appellant's submissions make reference to particular aspects of the complainant's account, and were relied upon in support of the submission that her account was inconsistent and difficult to understand. One such matter raised a question as to how, whilst lying on her lap, the Appellant could have reached under her top from above, as the complainant described in evidence. The complaint also detailed aspects of the complainant's evidence as to where she said she was sitting at various times, her account of the actions of the Appellant, and her actions in moving away from the Appellant on a couple of occasions. These matters were the subject of contest at the trial and they were specifically raised for the jury's consideration.

(4) The failure of the complainant to seek help was inexplicable. If the Appellant had acted as alleged, why did the complainant not seek help when there were at least three obvious opportunities to do so? Additionally, the complainant said that she composed three separate text messages to the Appellant during the evening. There seemed to be nothing to stop her sending a message to her sister or even Officer Gillett, seeking help.

37A number of factual matters were raised in the submissions for the Appellant suggesting inconsistency. These included in particular, that no effort was made by the complainant to contact neighbours after the offences and that the complainant gave inconsistent evidence as to why she did not contact them.

38The complainant gave her account as to why she did not contact neighbours. The failure to complain to neighbours was specifically the subject of examination in chief at the trial. The complainant gave her explanation which included that she only knew them on a ""bye or hi"" basis. As discussed below, she did, however, make early complaint to a number of other people, including police. 

(5) The behaviour of the complainant after the incident was inconsistent with what would be expected had the incident occurred.

39A number of matters were raised in relation to this specific complaint regarding the complainant's actions following the assaults she had alleged had been committed upon her. These included the fact that soon after the assaults she alleged had occurred, she spoke to two persons, both of whom had the Christian name ""Andrew"". She told one about the alleged sexual assaults upon her. She did not, for reasons given by her, tell the other person about them.

40In addition, reliance was placed in the appellant's submissions on the failure of the complainant to tell police that she had reported the assaults on the evening in question to Mathew Gillett, and what he had said to her in response to what she had said had occurred.

41It is unnecessary here to set out the detailed matters in the dot-points in relation to this specific complaint. The Complainant gave evidence as to her reasons for not telling police about her conversation with Mr Gillett until a later point in time. Again, these were matters that were raised in the cross-examination of the Appellant and were therefore left for the jury's consideration.

(6) There was a basis to conclude that the complainant's evidence of first complaint to 'Andrew' on MSN false.

42A number of matters in relation to this issue concerned text messages said to have been sent to the man named ""Andrew"". It was submitted by the Appellant that the complainant had not initially mentioned these text messages to police. (As to which see discussion below.) 

43The complainant in evidence explained that the sender of one particular text came from a person by the name of ""Andrew"" who was part of the deaf community. He was the person she decided she would not inform about the events of 9 July 2010.

44A question was posed as to whether the complainant's mention of contacting ""Andrew"" on the internet in her evidence-in-chief was a lie made in knowledge that she had communicated with a different Andrew that night. A series of other questions were posed. Again, these matters were the subject of examination during the course of the trial.

(7) There were problems with the complaint.

45A number of matters were detailed in support of this claim. It was contended by the Appellant that none of those matters were consistent with the complainant's evidence at trial. In other words, the evidence given by others was said to be inconsistent with the complainant's evidence of complaint given at trial. These matters were also the subject of attention during the course of the trial and closing addresses.

(8) The complainant lied repeatedly to the police.

46Reference on this aspect again relates to the fact that the complainant had sent text messages to, and received text messages from, Mr Gillett on the night of the events. She did not mention these to police in her initial statement.

47The complainant also omitted mention of contact over the internet with ""Andrew"" until her evidence at trial.

48In her second statement to police of 19 July 2010, the complainant did mention the text messaging with Mr Gillett. The submission by the Appellant was that she only disclosed the messages with Mr Gillett because she realised that the police had her phone and could carry out examination of the text messages. It was said that this was not the action of a person motivated to give an honest account. A number of matters were then set out which it was argued established that the complainant had told lies regarding the relationship between herself and Mr Gillett.

49On this matter, the Crown submitted as follows:

""47. The final matter raised by the [Appellant] as indicative of the untruthfulness of the complainant was her failure to initially give the police a full account of the role of [Mathew] Gillett. Whilst the [Appellant] relies on this aspect of the evidence as necessarily establishing that the complainant was an unremitting liar, the jury did not so conclude, a conclusion that was entirely open to it. A reasonable view of the whole of the relevant evidence is that [Mathew] Gillett's shame at his relationship with a disabled woman was at the heart of this aspect of the matter, not any conniving and dishonest conduct of the complainant.

48. The jury had a wealth of evidence before it - including information as to the history of the disclosure of this issue to police, and evidence from Mr Gillett - to allow it to assess the complainant's conduct. It is submitted that, in light of the whole of the evidence, this aspect of it was not such as to necessarily detract from the complainant's reliability. Indeed, it may be that the jury (reasonably) viewed this episode as indicative of the ease with which the complainant could be manipulated by others, rather than of dishonesty.""

50The Crown in its written submissions drew attention to the text message communications between the complainant and the Appellant. It was noted that the Appellant had contended that these communications are unsupportive of the complainant's assertion that the Appellant had articulated interest in a sexual relationship with her virtually from the start.

51As observed by the Crown, in relation to the communication between the complainant and the Appellant, it is necessary to bear in mind that the evidence of the text messages exchanged between the two are incomplete. The Crown, however, observed that what is interesting about the text messages is the extent to which they suggest that the Appellant's interest in the complainant, a woman he had never met, was overtly flirtatious. Particular matters to which attention was drawn included the following:


The messages contained in Exhibit C appear to support contact of the complainant by the Appellant on 14 June 2010 in circumstances where she was obliged to ask him who he was. It then appears from the complainant's reply on the same day that he had asked her out, and that her reluctance to go out with a virtual stranger is indicated by a further message contained within Exhibit C.


That there was then an apparent gap in contact which was consistent with the complainant's evidence, and that the resumption of communications coincided with the complainant discovering or realising that there was a possible familial relationship between the two (text messages 6 July 2010 - Exhibit C).


In the communication of 6 July 2010 the complainant's messages focused on exploring the familial connection.


It was the Appellant who introduced the concept of ""kissing cousins"" (text message 6 July 2010 - Exhibit C).


In a series of further exchanges the complainant rejected that concept as ""weird"", while the Appellant continued the concept of ""kissing cousins"" saying: ""I'll pretend I still don't know"" (of the family connection) (text messages 6 July 2010 - Exhibit C)


In subsequent messages the complainant revealed a reluctance to meet the Appellant, following which he offered to ""come over and look after"" her (text message 7 July 2010 at 11:39:05 - Exhibit C).


In other messages on 7 July 2010 it was the Appellant who appeared interested in physical contact (""can we lay and hug""; ""... still curious about kissing you""; ""I just want to kiss you ...""). The Crown observed that whilst the complainant insisted that a physical relationship would be ""weird"", she also stressed the need to ""respect that we do share the same family"".

52The Crown submission was that the Appellant was making ""unwanted sexual insinuation"": at [41]. The complainant's evidence of emphasising the family relationship, it was submitted by the Crown, rather than undermining her credibility, in fact supported it: Crown's Written Submissions at [41].

53The specific matters raised in support of Ground 1 are to be considered in light of all relevant considerations, including the following:

(1) All of the matters relied upon in the Appellant's submissions were, as previously mentioned, the subject of examination and testing at trial.

(2) Whatever the claimed inconsistencies or deficiencies in the complainant's evidence, the jury plainly accepted her as both a truthful and a reliable witness. Whatever difficulties or problems may have existed with aspects of her evidence, they were clearly not considered by the jury as significant.

(3) The benefit of the jury seeing the complainant give evidence was particularly significant in this case. She has a significant level of disability, in particular, cerebral palsy and global dysarthria (difficulties of articulating speech). Whilst her ability to communicate was significantly impaired, requiring the use of an Auslan interpreter, a reading of the transcript indicates that the complainant had a clear understanding of events and, at times, gave sharp and incisive responses. The jury was in a position to assess the veracity of her evidence in light of (i) the unusual presentation of her evidence due to her disabilities, and (ii) her demeanour.

(4) The complaint evidence provides a sound basis for evaluating the accuracy and truthfulness of the complainant's evidence. She was not cross-examined to suggest that she had given to police, or to her sister, a materially different version of what she said had actually taken place. Leaving to one side for separate discussion her failure to immediately call police or initially mention her communications with Mr Gillett, there was no suggestion made to the complainant in cross-examination to the effect that there were significant discrepancies between her statement to police and her evidence at trial.

(5) The submissions of defence counsel who appeared at trial, addressed and emphasised the matters relied upon, which are now the subject of the eight specific complaints relied upon.

(6) The forensic evidence was important evidence. It provided independent evidence of a corroborative nature.

(7) The verdict in respect of Count 4 did not indicate that the jury regarded the complainant's evidence as deliberately untruthful. Rather, the difficulty identified by the jury was its accuracy in terms as to whether there had actually been digital penetration. The incident occurred in circumstances that clearly involved a level of stress that was in turn capable of causing confusion to the complainant as to whether or not there had been penetration. Importantly, the jury were plainly satisfied that an indecent assault of some kind had occurred. This was consistent with what the trial judge said about Count 4 in his remarks on sentence: 

""The verdict of not guilty to the fourth count on the indictment, but guilty to the alternative of aggravated indecent assault, must have been upon the premise that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused digitally penetrated the victim's vagina, but otherwise accepted her description of the misconduct:"" Remarks on Sentence: T 5, 24 April 2012.

54Complaint evidence and forensic evidence (DNA) was adduced in the Crown case. The evidence was plainly significant in the assessment of the complainant's account of events. After the Appellant left the complainant's home, the complainant said she was panicking and walking around the house thinking of what to do. She did not consider going to police at that point as it was very late and she said she was afraid to go outside. She did, however, send a text message to Mathew Gillett who at that time was still an online friend. She knew that he was a police officer and she sought his advice. He told her to report it to police. He told her not to wait as, if police require evidence, they needed to act quickly: (text messages, 9 July 2010 and 10 July 2010 - Exhibit E).

55Also on the night of 9 July 2010, the complainant telephoned her sister and told her that she had been sexually assaulted. The complainant subsequently drove to her sister's house. Her sister said that the complainant appeared scared and she was crying The complainant gave her sister details of what she alleged had taken place and what she said the Appellant had done.

56As a result of a triple-000 call made at 2.08am on 10 July 2010, police attended at about 2.25am at the unit belonging to the complainant's sister. Police subsequently accompanied the complainant and her sister to Liverpool Hospital. Police wrote a report of the matter on the COPS system based on memory and a police notebook.

57The complainant gave Dr Houston at the hospital, with the assistance of her sister, an account of the sexual assaults upon her by the Appellant she alleged had taken place some hours earlier. She marked on a diagram of a female torso the areas she said the Appellant licked or sucked. There was then a discussion of the issue of penetration to which reference has been made above.

58As to the application of the test in the present case, I will address the same in the conclusion expressed below following consideration of each of the other grounds. 

Ground 2 - The trial judge erred in failing to adequately warn the jury that the prosecution case relied wholly on the evidence of the complainant

59There was no complaint of this kind made at trial. Accordingly, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.

60The written submissions for the Appellant set out extracts from the summing up in which the trial judge emphasised the absolute importance of the evidence of the complainant to the Crown case. In that respect:

(i) At page 7 of the summing up the jury were instructed that if the conclusion was reached that the Appellant was not guilty of any of the counts, then consideration would need to be given as to how that conclusion might affect the jury's consideration of the other counts. In that context, his Honour stated:

""And it is important in this case ladies and gentlemen, because as I will make clear, I hope, the Crown case depends upon the evidence of the complainant, for without her evidence the Crown case must fail.

In respect of each count the Crown case depends upon the evidence of the complainant. If you do not accept beyond reasonable doubt her allegations that the accused touched her breasts and sucked her breasts and had sexual intercourse without her consent by digitally penetrating her vagina, knowing that she was not consenting in each case, the accused must be found not guilty"": T 7-8, 14 February 2012.

(ii) Following reference to the Crown case as relying upon the evidence of the complainant, the presence of the accused's DNA on the relevant swabs, and the evidence of the complainant, the trial judge stated:

""The Crown case does depend upon the evidence from the complainant. If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she was truthful and reliable in her evidence, speaking to the essential ingredients of each of the charges, you must acquit the accused"": T 26, 14 February 2012.

(iii) When directing the jury not to simply accept the version of events they preferred, the trial judge stated:

""You may return a verdict of guilty in respect of any charge only if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was truthful and accurate in her evidence regarding the ingredients of that charge"": T 26, 14 February 2012.

61In the submissions for the Appellant it was acknowledged that the trial judge emphasised to the jury that the Crown case depended solely upon the complainant's account.

62It was also accepted in the Appellant's written submissions that the direction set out above did emphasise to the jury the central importance of the complainant's evidence. However, it was contended:

""[That] did not amount to a warning. Nowhere in the trial judge's summing up did he direct the jury that before accepting the complainant's account they were required to scrutinise her evidence with great care."" Appellant's Written Submissions at [151].

63In paragraph [154] of the Appellant's written submissions a number of features of the case said to warrant a warning were set out. These included what was termed ""the problems in her account"", this being a reference to the matters set out in the submissions in relation to Ground 1. Because of these ""problems"" it was said that the complainant's evidence required, ""... the closest scrutiny by the jury"": at [154]. These were summarised in dot-point form in that paragraph.

64Finally, it was submitted that the trial judge's failure to provide a warning occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

65The Crown referred to the decisions of this Court which emphasise that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is not to be regarded as a ""mere technicality"": see in particular Ward v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [26]-[28].

66It was the Crown's submission that trial counsel did not complain about the trial judge's directions because they were perfectly adequate in the context of the trial as it had been conducted before the jury: Crown's Written Submissions at [63].

67In support, it was emphasised that ""there was no mystery that the only evidence the Crown could point to which was capable of proving the charges was that of the complainant"": Crown's Written Submissions at [64].

68The focus of the trial, the Crown further observed, was plainly on the complainant and on the question of her reliability. The trial judge had emphasised on more than one occasion the significance of the complainant's evidence and the fact that the jury had to accept her evidence beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict the Appellant on any of the charges.

69It is plain that the trial judge emphasised the absolute importance of the complainant's evidence. His Honour also emphasised the fundamental requirement of the jury accepting the complainant as being both truthful and accurate in her evidence before the Appellant could be convicted on any of the charges. 

70By reason of the repeated and very strong and clear directions given by the trial judge, I do not consider that in the particular circumstances of the present case, having regard to all the evidence adduced in the Crown case, there was the need for a direction as referred to in Ground 2.

71In addition to the above references to the trial direction, the trial judge told the jury:

""Where in a case such as this there is evidence from a complainant alleging sexual assault and evidence from the accused denying the offence, your task is not to decide which of the two versions you prefer. You may return a verdict of guilty in respect of any charge only if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was truthful and accurate in her evidence regarding the ingredients of that charge. As I explained earlier, even though you might not accept the accused's evidence, he is not to be found guilty unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the evidence given by the complainant. If you are not, you are obliged by the law to find the accused not guilty."" Summing Up, T 26-27, 14 February 2012.

72I accept the Crown's submission that it could not have escaped the jury, given the directions of the trial judge, that the Crown case rested on the evidence of the complainant and that before any finding of guilt could be made against the accused the evidence had to be carefully examined and accepted to the required standard before they could be satisfied that it proved his guilt. 

73I also accept the submission made on behalf of the Crown that whilst his Honour did not employ the specific phrase ""scrutinise the evidence with care"", ordinarily used in a Murray direction (R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19), in the circumstances of this case it was not necessary or essential for the trial judge to have used that phrase.

74The trial judge gave adequate directions including on the claimed inconsistencies in relation to the complainant's evidence which needed to be considered in evaluating the truth and reliability of the complainant as a witness. This was a case in which the complainant's evidence was required to be considered in context, which included her complaints, the evidence of her distressed condition given by her sister, and the forensic evidence called in the Crown case.

75I have concluded that there is no substance to this ground. On that basis, accordingly, Ground 2 should be dismissed.

Ground 3 - The absence of both evidence of good character and directions on good character occasioned a miscarriage of justice

76It was submitted for the Appellant that good character evidence should have been adduced at trial in the circumstances of the case and a good character direction sought from the trial judge.

77It was acknowledged in the Appellant's written submissions that as a direction on good character was not sought, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies.

78The Appellant was a serving Probationary Constable at the time of the allegations. At a later time, namely on 5 October 2011, a Notice of Order for the appellant's dismissal from the NSW Police Force pursuant to the Police Act 1990 was served on behalf of the Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police. The basis for the dismissal as specified in the Notice was that on 9 July 2010 the Appellant had assaulted the complainant. Consequently, as at the date of the commencement of the trial, namely 6 February 2012, the appellant was no longer a member of the Police Force. 

79The Appellant had no prior convictions, and the Crown Prosecutor adduced that fact in the Crown case.

80In the written submissions on behalf of the Appellant, it was stated that five personal references were tendered on the Appellant's behalf at the sentencing hearing. The written submissions contained extracts of the references attesting to the appellant's good character and commenting on his appropriate behaviour towards women.

81In the written submissions for the Appellant it was stated that despite the evidence of an absence of criminal convictions in the Crown case and the existence of material as contained in the personal references, no evidence of the appellant's good character was adduced: at [164].

82Additionally, the written submissions for the Appellant ... that despite the Crown's apparent concession that the Appellant was a person of prior good character, no good character directions were sought.

83It was further submitted for the Appellant that the Crown case relied entirely on the sworn evidence of the complainant. The Appellant gave sworn evidence denying the allegations. Evidence of good character it was said: ""... may have assumed a critical importance"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [166]. It was submitted that such evidence would have allowed the jury to contrast the depiction of the appellant by the complainant with the observations and opinions of those who knew him well.

84It was also observed that the jury would have been instructed by the trial judge that the good character of the Appellant could be used both in considering the issue of guilt and bearing on his credibility in considering whether his account in evidence was likely to be true: Attwood v The Queen (1960) 102 CLR 353 at 359.

85In the written submissions for the Appellant at [168], it was contended that no explanation for the absence of the evidence or the directions regarding the appellant's good character appeared from the transcript of the trial: at [168]. Efforts had been made on behalf of the Appellant's current solicitor to ascertain the reason for the omission of the material from the trial, but those attempts had been unsuccessful. The submission in those circumstances was that ""... there is nothing to suggest the decision was made for forensic purposes and the actions of the Crown Prosecutor in adducing evidence that the [Appellant] had no prior conviction tends to confirm this"" at [168].

86At the hearing of the appeal, the affidavit of the Appellant declared and affirmed on 7 November 2013 was read.

87The Crown relied upon two affidavits. Firstly, the affidavit of the Appellant's former solicitor Mr Dom Velcic, sworn 21 June 2013. Secondly, the affidavit of Andrew Martin, barrister-at-law, affirmed 7 June 2013. Both Mr Velcic and Mr Martin were extensively cross-examined at the hearing of the appeal.

88There was conflict on some matters between the account given by the Appellant in his affidavit and the evidence based on the recollections of Mr Velcic and Mr Martin.

89The Appellant said that he was charged with the offences concerning the complainant in July 2010 and he then contacted Mr Velcic who then acted for him in the matter: Affidavit of Peter Giallombardo affirmed 7 November 2013 at [3].

90Prior to the committal the Appellant said he had a meeting with Mr Velcic and Mr Martin. He said he recalled Mr Martin saying something about needing to consider calling evidence or witnesses as to his character. Mr Velcic, according to the Appellant, immediately responded saying words to the effect of ""we cannot call evidence of his character because of the previous allegations from his ex-wife"": Affidavit of Peter Giallombardo affirmed 7 November 2013 at [6].

91The Appellant then said in his affidavit that Mr Velcic said that there were similarities between the allegations and that the Crown would call his ex-wife against him: at [6] He added:

""... I reminded Mr Velcic, at this time, that my ex-wife had been charged with making a false report to Police and harassment and intimidation against me but Mr Velcic dismissed it and said it doesn't matter because the allegations were still similar"": at [6].

92The Appellant stated that that was the only time he ever recalled any discussion about calling evidence as to his good character being raised at any time throughout the proceedings: Affidavit of Peter Giallombardo affirmed 7 November 2013 at [7].

93The Appellant further stated: ""I informed Mr Velcic that [the Appellant's ex-wife] had been convicted of making a false statement alleging a sexual assault upon her by other people, but not by a police officer"": at [8].

94The submissions for the Appellant proceeded upon the assumption that there was no proper basis for the failure to adduce evidence of his claimed good character at trial.

95As noted previously, Ground 3 raises a complaint that was not made by the Appellant at trial. Accordingly, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. The Crown submitted that leave should be refused.

96The Crown submitted that it is clear from the affidavit evidence of trial counsel that evidence of good character, beyond that implicit in the evidence led by the Crown, was not placed before the jury and no direction in respect of good character was sought by the Appellant. This, the Crown observed, was as a consequence of a considered forensic decision by Mr Martin of counsel, after having discussed the issue at length with his client and having obtained those instructions from him:

""It is submitted that the evidence disclosed in the affidavits establishes that a legitimate forensic decision was taken in relation to the way the [Appellant's] case would be presented on the issue of his character"": Crown's Written Submissions at [90].

97The Crown additionally submitted that the conclusions reached by Mr Martin as to the prospects of success of any application pursuant to ss 110 and 192A of the Evidence Act were soundly based. The evidence as left to the jury by agreement between the Crown Prosecutor and the legal representatives of the Appellant, it was submitted, meant that the Appellant had some limited benefit of an inference in his favour on the issue of his character: Crown's Written Submissions at [94].

98The evidence of Mr Velcic on the subject offences, and Mr Martin, established the following matters:

(1) Specific consideration was given by each of them to the benefits and possible disadvantages to the Appellant in leading character evidence at the trial.

(2) There were two potentially countervailing matters that were considered in determining whether good character evidence should be adduced. The first related to an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (""ADVO"") that had been sought by the Appellant's ex-wife. The second concerned the Appellant's dismissal from the NSW Police Force.

(3) As to the first, Mr Martin said his understanding before the trial was that the ADVO was based on an alleged encounter between the Appellant and his ex-wife at a time when he was in the police service. The allegation was that he had indecently assaulted her.

(4) Mr Martin said in evidence on the appeal that an officer from the Director of Public Prosecutions, not long before the trial was fixed to commence on 19 September 2011, informed him that if evidence of good character was led by the defence, then evidence of the alleged indecent assault on the Appellant's ex-wife would be called. He said that officers of the Professional Standards Command displayed their knowledge of the facts alleged in support of the ADVO application.

(5) Mr Martin said he and Mr Velcic considered at that time, that there was an unfortunate similarity between some aspects of the allegations concerning the Appellant's ex-wife and some allegations raised by the complainant in the trial.

(6) As at September 2011, Mr Martin said he had the belief that the Appellant was still a serving police officer though under suspension as a result of the allegations made by the complainant. In oral evidence, Mr Martin stated that he eventually (during the trial) came to an understanding that the Appellant had been dismissed from the NSW Police Force because of the complainant's allegations: T 21:5-10, 28 November 2013.

(7) Mr Martin's evidence was that the Appellant's dismissal had caused him concern. Mr Martin said that at the time of the trial there had been publicity in the newspapers about the Commissioner of Police saying he no longer had confidence in certain police officers who had been dismissed. That, Mr Martin considered, had ""certain connotations in the context of the trial"": T 21:15-20, 28 November 2013. He said in that respect:

""I was concerned that if it were revealed to the jury that he'd been dismissed from the [Police Force], that that fact alone might reflect poorly on his character"": T 21:15-20, 28 November 2013.

99Mr Martin said that that was his view even though he knew that the Appellant had been dismissed solely because of the complainant's allegations: T 21:20-25, 28 November 2013. Mr Martin said he agreed that he was concerned about the possibility that ""people"" would speculate about it: T 21:25-30, 28 November 2013.

100In his affidavit, Mr Martin identified the issues that he said presented him with a dilemma. The first was that evidence that may have been led relating to the allegations involving the Appellant's ex-wife appeared to be relevant in reply to evidence of good character ""in a particular respect"" within the meaning of s 110(3) of the Evidence Act 1995. Mr Martin said he thought this was a sufficiently strong point to render inexpedient, or even futile, the seeking of an advance ruling under s 192A of the Evidence Act.

101The second issue related to the fact that Mr Martin had, up until the time the trial began, believed that the Appellant was a serving police officer. This had led to the position whereby the prosecution had agreed to adduce evidence of the fact that the Appellant had no prior convictions in the Crown case. Until Mr Martin was informed that the appellant had been dismissed, he had been intending to rely on evidence that the appellant was a person generally of good character, rather than a person of good character ""in a particular respect"".

102The evidence as to character was to include the fact that the Appellant was still a serving police officer, though under suspension, solely as Mr Martin understood it, in relation to the subject matter of the charges for trial.

103Once Mr Martin was informed that he had been dismissed, that, to his mind, raised ""other issues"". He considered that once that fact became known the jury might, from their own knowledge, be aware that it suggested that the Appellant no longer enjoyed the Commissioner's confidence. It also implied that the Appellant was dismissed for reasons other than the allegations made by the complainant. Mr Martin considered that reply evidence could be called from the officer in charge of the case pursuant to s 110(2) of the Evidence Act without being limited by the hearsay rule, the opinion rule, the tendency rule and the credibility rule to establish that the appellant was not a person of good character.

104Finally, Mr Martin acknowledged in his affidavit that, with the benefit of hindsight, he could see how an application in regard to evidence of good character generally would have been appropriate. He said that he could only assume that he did not consider such an application because he had been distracted by the surprise of discovering that the Appellant had in fact been dismissed from the Police Force.

105Mr Velcic stated in his affidavit sworn on 21 June 2013, that he had had discussions with Mr Martin and the Appellant, together and separately, regarding the evidence of his character being led at trial. He said they discussed the similar factual circumstances of the Appellant's ex-wife's ADVO allegations and the complainant's allegations. He said he provided the Appellant with strategic advice in respect of his character. He said that he was of the opinion that there was evidence available to the prosecution, in the form of the allegations of the Appellant's ex-wife, that would likely rebut any proposition that the Appellant was of ""good character"": at [15].

106Mr Velcic further stated that he advised the Appellant that he needed to resist the highly prejudicial and unfavourable ADVO allegations from being presented at trial: at [16]. He said a prudent approach was required to avoid raising the issue of the Appellant's character. 

107In addition, Mr Velcic said that the Appellant, Mr Martin and himself were in agreement with respect to these tactical decisions throughout the trial matter: at [16].

108The evidence, including in particular that of Mr Martin, which I accept, establishes that considerable attention and consideration was given to adducing character evidence at the Appellant's trial. In particular, the ability of the Crown to call evidence in reply to evidence of good character, or at least the possibility of it doing so, was considered having regard to the two issues discussed above.

109In relation to the first issue (the allegations made by the Appellant's ex-wife), it was not unreasonable for the solicitor and counsel for the Appellant, without being in a position to evaluate the actual truthfulness and reliability of the ex-wife's allegations, to have made what was in this case in the nature of a tactical decision. That decision was against calling evidence of good character (and therefore to forego the opportunity of seeking a good character direction) and negotiating a position whereby the Crown agreed to adduce evidence of the fact that the Appellant had no prior convictions. The original intention had been to call evidence as to his position as a serving police officer.

110As to the Appellant's submission that evidence of good character assumed critical importance, it is true that the Crown case depended upon the complainant's credibility. However, the entirety of the evidence in the Crown case must also be brought to account. In this respect, as discussed above, there was strong evidence of complaint and the forensic (DNA) evidence was consistent with certain of the very particular allegations made by the complainant. Taken in combination, the evidence as a whole constituted a strong case for the Crown.

111The factual circumstances in R v D (1996) 86 A Crim R 41, relied upon in the Appellant's written submissions, were very different to those of the present case. In R v D there was no corroboration which implicated the Appellant. In that case, the credibility of the complainant was very much in issue, so much so, that Hunt CJ at CL said that he was satisfied that there was a substantial chance that the jury would have acquitted the Appellant if the available character evidence had been given: at p 44. That is not a conclusion that could, in my assessment, be reached in the present case assuming that evidence of good character adduced at the sentencing hearing had been called at trial. 

112I am of the opinion that Ground 3 does not raise a valid ground of appeal. Having considered the evidence of Mr Martin and Mr Velcic, I am satisfied that proper consideration was given to the question of calling good character evidence, and a tactical decision made, and that the Appellant had been apprised of the rationale for that decision. Accordingly, the absence of evidence of good character and directions on good character has not, in my opinion, occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

Conclusion

113Upon consideration of the evidence advanced at trial, I have concluded that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of the offences charged.

114This is a case where there was evidence of a very early complaint by the complainant to more than one person, followed by the medical examination performed the day after the date on which the complainant alleged she had been assaulted.

115This is also a case in which the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, in particular, the complainant, which is of significance. It is clear that the jury formed a favourable view of the complainant and of the accounts she gave in evidence. 

116This is a case that was very much a word against word case, in which the complainant's credibility was fully tested. The various criticisms relied upon in support of Ground 1 were ventilated in cross-examination, and it was the jury's function to determine whether the complainant's accounts established the matters alleged beyond reasonable doubt. Having reviewed the whole of the evidence, this is not a case where, in my assessment, a reasonable doubt has been established.

117I, accordingly, propose that the appeal be dismissed.

		12 March 2014",2014-03-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763421,R v Birnie [2014] NSWDC 146,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Camas Birnie appears today for sentence in relation to an offence committed by him on 5 June 2013 at Bondi Junction in the State of New South Wales. On that date at that place he supplied an amount of prohibited drug to wit 2.98 kilograms of ""methylamphetamine (ice)"" being an amount which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. It carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and/or a monetary penalty of $660,000. It has a standard nonparole period of 15 years imprisonment.

2The prisoner was arrested on the date that the offence was finally completed, those words being apposite given the build-up to his arrest, and he has been in custody since 5 June 2013. All the time spent in custody is solely referrable to this offending. It shall be taken into account in the fixing of the sentence. The Crown has tendered a statement of facts, criminal history, a supplementary statement by one of the investigating police, a pre-sentence report and other material which has obviously all been taken into account.

3In determining the facts in relation to this matter I have taken into account the evidence given by the prisoner and the material that I accept from prisoner's evidence I have included in my factual assessment, bearing in mind that the statement of facts, or probably correctly said the agreed statement of facts, does not include any version given by the prisoner on his arrest as he exercised his right to silence. The first occasion the prisoner has disclosed any version of events in relation to the current matters is when he gave evidence. I know that he has given a history to psychologists and the Probation and Parole Service officers, but those matters really are disclosures in private before they are tendered in court.

4The prisoner, as I understand it, is now 38 years of age and he is a citizen of Canada. He was living in British Columbia and was approached by a man who he named as 'Benjamin', as I understood the spelling of the surname, 'Wha,' who was his regular marijuana supplier and requested him to assist in the delivery of a package here in Sydney, Australia. Whatever the prevarications in the evidence of the prisoner about the matter, it is clear that he must have known that he was being asked to involve himself in the supply of prohibited drugs.

5At the time that the prisoner was approached to involve himself in the criminal enterprise that leads him to this Court he was recovering from a severe motor vehicle accident in 2012 when he suffered a damaged ankle and shoulder which for over 12 months rendered him unable to undertake work in the construction industry, where he had been occupied at that particular time. Over that 12 months period he had spent a number of months living with his sister. He had, he said, no financial resources and no access to money. Although he had employment lined up on his proposed return to Sydney.

6At the time of his motor vehicle accident he worked as what was described as an industrial rope access technician, and I have seen a number of photographs which show the character of that work. The fracture and/or dislocation of his ankle and his shoulder damage obviously would have rendered him unfit to do the precarious and dangerous work that he had previously with which he had been involved.

7He said in his evidence before me that he was to receive for his involvement in this crime a return airfare between Vancouver and Sydney and $4,000 Canadian. He was given cash to purchase the airline ticket. He arrived in Australia on 17 May 2013 and initially, as I understood his evidence (I have to point out for the purposes of the record I have no transcript of last week's proceedings) he was initially to return on 3 June. 

8For a period of time he lived in various backpackers premises and ultimately in early June moved into the Quest Apartments in Bondi Junction. Whilst he was in Australia the plans as he understood them of delivering a package by taxi changed. He had contact with a number of people, including a person who met him and took away his passport and his airline ticket. He also spoke to a Canadian and an Australian man who, I assume, had connections with the criminal organisation or enterprise in Canada that had recruited him. He also said in his evidence he spoke to an Asian man.

9Eventually, a few days before he was arrested, a package was dropped off for him to look after, on the understanding that he was to deliver the contents of that package, as he described it, to another Asian man. He made arrangements after the delivery of the package to meet the Canadian and the Australian at a nearby café to where he was staying. The prisoner was noticeably vague about any names and details of the people with whom he was dealing. One approaches these rather vague descriptions of events with considerable circumspection, particularly in the circumstances where a person has not chosen to provide any assistance to the authorities before he gave evidence in this court. In any event, unbeknown to him, the New South Wales Police had setup a strike force to investigate the supply of methylamphetamine by members of an organised crime syndicate based in Sydney, and particular people became targets of this investigation, including a man by the name Giang Nam Nguyen who was involved in ""the large scale supply of prohibited drugs"".

10On 5 June 2013 information became available that Mr Nguyen had been in conversation with another person in respect of matters obviously related to a large scale drug supply. At 2.02pm Nguyen contacted the prisoner on a mobile phone service which was registered in the prisoner's name and had a conversation ""via text messaging"". Nguyen requested to meet the prisoner the next day but the prisoner indicated that he was about to leave for Canada and they should meet that night, sometime about 7pm. They agreed to meet at 30 Spring Street, Bondi Junction, where I understand the Quest Serviced Apartments were located. It was not difficult for the name of the prisoner to be identified from the particulars of the telecommunication service that he was using.

11At about 6.45 pm Nguyen, who was under police surveillance, arrived at the premises carrying what was an empty backpack. The prisoner met Nguyen outside the premises and they went back inside. At about 10 past 7 Nguyen left the lifts of the Quest Apartment with the backpack strapped to both of his shoulders. He was arrested by police and police on searching the backpack found a package wrapped in redcoloured wrapping paper, having a yellow envelope attached to it. Inside this wrapping there were three Glad resealable plastic bags containing an off-white crystallised substance which later was established to be methylamphetamine, otherwise referred to in the facts as ""ice"" weighing a total of 2.983 kilograms with a very high level of purity of 85.5%. 

12Police then went to the unit of the prisoner. They were armed with a search warrant. They found the prisoner inside the unit and they arrested him. Both prisoners were conveyed to the police station. The prisoner was in possession of a modest amount of cash, something in excess of $500. The matters that were within the possession of Nguyen are of no relevance to Mr Birnie, nor are claimed to be of any relevant to him. The prisoner when interviewed exercised his right to silence, hence the situation where he did not give a roughly contemporaneous account of what had happened.

13The prisoner at the time of this offending had no criminal convictions in Canada or in Australia. I have details about his background from his evidence, the history that he gave to a psychologist and from his mother. In relation to the other evidence in the case I firstly deal with material in the defence case, the psychology report, because it provides the most amount of detail of the two reports I have concerning the prisoner's background. The Probation and Parole Service does in general terms accord with the detail of the psychologist's report. I will refer to it in a moment.

14Mr Bradley Jones, a psychologist, prepared the report setting out the personal history of the prisoner, the prisoner's explanation to him of his offending and details of the prisoner's education, employment, history of drug and alcohol use and some assessment, not a complete assessment, by the psychologist with any skills of the psychological profile of the prisoner. Of course a number of the tests that the psychologist administered are known to this Court and known to be self-reporting tests. Thus a number of the results are very much dependant upon the reliability of the reporter.

15In conjunction with the prisoner's evidence and from the evidence from the prisoner's mother I am satisfied that the prisoner was brought up in remote areas of Canada described as the Yukon in the area between British Columbia and Alberta and Alaska. He was educated at remote schools, usually in company with many First Nation children. He displayed in his early years a great deal of oppositional behaviour and would appear to have suffered symptoms consistent with ADHD. As a consequence his education was interrupted. He went to a more urban high school for one year, on the evidence of his mother, but still left prematurely.

16He described to the psychologist that he had been working since the age of 17 in the oil fields firstly before then embarking upon a range of unskilled and semi-skilled occupations in the timber industry, road engineering, construction, and forestry exploration. I would imagine many of these occupations led to long periods of time away from urban living. He was the eldest of three children. As I understand the matter, two of his siblings are considerably younger than he. 

17Between 2004 and 2009 he worked for the municipality of Whistler, an area famous for its ski resorts and walking trails. It would appear, although the details are somewhat opaque or limited, the prisoner had a relationship that broke down about three or four years before his motor vehicle accident. Also there were some issues, as I understand it, arising from the impending commencement of the Winter Olympic Games at Whistler in 2010 that led to the prisoner leaving the employment with the municipality, although he became involved in the rope technician work, which involved rope access and rope rescue work. He apparently did some work at various venues where the Winter Olympics were held.

18He ceased employment in December 2010 to travel overseas, returning to Canada in 2012 and shortly after his return he was involved in the serious motor vehicle accident to which I refer. These injuries I accept prevented him from working and caused him to have significant financial difficulties. He became reliant upon family and friends for financial assistance and shelter and was, as I said earlier, expecting to return to work after his return from Australia. As I understand his history, not only were his occupations concerned with adventurous and dangerous conditions, but also were his leisure pursuits. He claimed to have been a heavy drinker of alcohol in his teens and twenties, but that had moderated. But he had consumed over a period of time since his teens a number of prohibited drugs, as we would describe them in Australia, including cocaine, marijuana and MDMA, although he was never drug dependant, he described himself as being more a social user of drugs, or using drugs in a social context.

19The testing of the psychologist revealed current mild levels of anxiety and what the psychologist described as current ""severe levels of depression"". The prisoner's personality profile was that of a person of dependence, and for reasons that are not fully explained, constant feelings of guilt and selfcondemnation, a markedly deflated sense of self esteem and with an expectation of repeated personal failures. These were said to constrain his efforts to become ""more autonomous or independent"". 

20In the context of the interviews conducted earlier this year he reflected upon becoming increasingly pessimistic about the future and brooding over past events. His personality profile revealed him to be largely timid, shy, apprehensive, sensitive to public humiliation and rejection with a willingness to accept feelings of worthlessness and guilt. In the testing there was no evidence of malingering or deception. 

21Tests administered, such as the LSI-R an accredited standardised assessment measure of re-offending, revealed him to be at low risk of reoffending. It was said that factors that were protective against re-offending were what the psychologist described as ""behavioural self control"", emphatic concern for others, his attitude towards authority, stable living conditions in Canada, supportive family network, evidenced by his mother's presence here, as with his father's, and his sister's testimonial and future family support on release from custody. Of course, it must fairly said that some of these aspects of the prisoner's profile were somewhat missing in the course of the offending behaviour with which I am concerned. 

22His agreement to come across the Pacific to commit a serious crime in this country does show a very serious lack of self control. I also found startling the prisoner's claim that when he committed this offence he did not fully appreciate the impact of illegal drugs upon others until he went to Long Bay Gaol and saw the damage that had been done or rendered to fellow inmates. One might have thought that his experience of using drugs in Canada would have made the dangers and damage of prohibited drug self-evident to him well before he came to these shores.

23Given his history of drug usage and his obvious association with drug suppliers one would have thought that the situation in Canada was not dissimilar to Australia and that in effect he should have truly been familiar with the damaging effects of drug dependence, even if he was not so drug dependant. 

24The psychologist opined that he did have a tendency to minimise his behaviour, which I believe was reflected in his evidence in this court, given that his conduct in the commission of this offence was very much at odds with what I accepted of his usual self-belief system. The psychologist further opined that he committed the offence to be less reliant upon others focussing on what the psychologist described as ""a positive financial outcome"". I must point out this analysis by the psychologist, presumably based upon what he was told by the prisoner, is somewhat at odds with the prisoner's evidence of committing the crime for what he said either expressly, or in paraphrased form, a ""paid holiday"".

25The psychologist believed the prisoner ""engaged in self-deception and minimisation of his offending"" and failed to view his behaviour other than in isolation from the larger implications of the drug enterprise. 

26I noted earlier that he viewed his behaviour somewhat in isolation from the larger implications of the drug enterprise. I am paraphrasing when using that expression the words of the psychologist, but it may be one way of putting it. I accept however the view of the psychologist that his current realisation and remorse with regards to his offending, and particularly noting his current circumstances in custody, have had a significant effect upon him and will be and have been a major salutary factor to prevent him re-offending in the future, to my mind as important as the other matters identified by the psychologist.

27Whilst the psychologist expressed an opinion that the accused is ""suffering"" from a ""major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate,"" it is clear that that ""diagnosis,"" if it could be classified as such, is concerned with the prisoner's current circumstances. The psychologist noted that this clinical condition is ""relatively transient,"" that it was waxing and waning in its prominence and intensity depending upon ""the presence of environmental stress."" I take that to be another way of saying, as a consequence of being in gaol. 

28Clearly having regard to the absence of any history of past diagnosed depressive illness requiring treatment, this condition that he currently suffers is reactive to his current circumstances of custody, and I accept that those circumstances are very foreign for him and present for him a very stressful environment. Unfortunately for people such as this offender, this is the consequence of committing serious crimes. He is not however a prisoner who could fear any reprisal from his employers because frankly, even allowing for what he gave evidence about in my court, he has done nothing really to cause any harm to those in Vancouver who hired him, or those in Australia with whom he dealt. On the other hand, I accept in the context of his naivety that the prisoner may well have been denied relevant information about the identity of the people with whom he was to deal here in Australia.

29The psychologist recommends a treatment program including cognitive behaviour therapy, counselling and other therapy to assist him in the future. The psychologist also noted a strong willingness and motivation to undertake a treatment program and what was described as greater insight into his offending behaviour. One must note however that it would not take a great deal of insight if one had a moderate degree of intelligence which the prisoner obviously has, to have an understanding of this particular offending behaviour given the absence of any really impulsive element of the offending. Of course, he may have impulsively agreed to the proposition from a man in Vancouver that he would fly across the Pacific and commit a serious crime in Australia, but he had the time of that flight plus almost two weeks before the delivery of the package to him to consider his situation.

30The psychologist rather optimistically noted that if he was ""fortunate enough not to receive a custodial sentence...he be required to undergo therapy, et cetera, for a minimum period of six to nine months."" Whilst of course I recommend he receives such psychological and medical assistance as is available in the gaol system and can be provided to him in custody, there is clearly no prospect of a non-custodial sentence for this type of offending given the maximum penalty and the guidance provided by the standard non-parole period. 

31The evidence of the prisoner reveals no matter other than the personal financial circumstances of the prisoner that had any causal relationship with the offending and thus in the context of the assessment of the prisoner's presentation at the time of interview, no issue arises as might be identified from what could be loosely described as 'Hemsley' or 'De La Rosa principles' for consideration in this sentencing exercise, as was conceded in submissions.

32The Probation and Parole Service report sets out in summary much the same history, reflects upon the prisoner's tough upbringing as a child and some emotional disconnection from his parents. The report also notes the prisoner's academic underachievement, but also refers to his extensive employment history and the interruption of it by his motor vehicle accident. I accept the prisoner has a long history of employment and industry and that he is not a person who is disposed ordinarily to commit crime for financial again. The report of the Probation and Parole Service reflects upon a history of cannabis use and some abuse of Xanax after a relationship break-up and particularly after his motor vehicle accident. This was a matter not particularly dwelt upon by the psychologist. 

33The report reflects upon the prisoner's financial difficulties after the motor vehicle accident but also stated that the prisoner took full responsibilities for his actions and expressed ""considerable shame."" The Probation and Parole 

34Service officer assessed that the prisoner's conduct was at odds with his value system and that the prisoner had learned a valuable lesson. The Probation and Parole Service report suggested that the prisoner's use of Xanax may have been a contributing factor, impairing his cognitive judgment. This was a matter not particular pressed in the evidence of the prisoner nor worthy of comment in the psychologist's report. 

35In assessment, the Probation and Parole Service officer noted the prisoner's ""extensive network of pro-social supports in Canada"" and his extensive employment history, his contrition and his low risk of reoffending given the absence of any factors that might cause him to offend, and confirmed that on his release he will be deported.

36I also have a number of references from the prisoner's parents, his mother having given evidence, the prisoner's sister and two friends. His parents speak of his loyalty to family, his problems growing up in remote areas of Canada with his ADHD, his love of adventure activities, the support that he received from his younger sister, and the effect upon him of his motor vehicle accident in 2012, affecting his finances and his security. 

37The parents and his sister reflected upon his contrition and his insight into the circumstances that he currently faces. His sister, who is approximately ten years younger than him, spoke of his kindness, his selflessness, his sense of adventure and his loyalty and she, as I said earlier, confirms his financial difficulties. She felt that in the weeks before he came to Australia he was avoiding her ""because he was ashamed of the direction he was headed."" 

38Ms Rotheram, a friend of four years, spoke of his good manners, said that he was a carefree, easygoing person, but his attitude changed just prior to coming to Australia. She was concerned about his circumstances of custody ""breaking his spirit."" A co-worker from the municipality of Whistler who was a supervisor, Mr Ross, described him as having a positive attitude, being honest and hardworking, with a ""warm and compassionate heart.""

39I have already dealt with the evidence of the prisoner in relation to his involvement in this offending. He said in his evidence before me that he regarded himself as generally a good person, but he did not understand fully the impact of ""ice"" upon other people. In prison he works as a sweeper, but has no visits because his family are overseas, as are his friends. He said he is unlikely to ever get into serious trouble again. He accepts his greed led him to his current circumstances. He saw this as a quick way of obtaining some money to hold him over until he got a job. 

40His mother also gave evidence of his difficulties in upbringing, living in a remote community, struggling with studies, going to schools with other young children from 'First Nation' peoples, apparently affecting his capacity to succeed at school. She was concerned that after he left high school he did not have any skills, but his parents were busy raising two smaller children and they had brought the family back to an urban environment to assist with their education. She confirmed his industry and his regular employment and, as I said earlier, his various financial difficulties. She did say in answer to a question from myself that if he had asked for financial assistance that his parents would have provided it. He has been in contact with his mother three times a week and said that he was genuinely remorseful for his involvement in the offending.

41In submissions on behalf of the prisoner, learned Senior Counsel for him pointed to objective features of the matter that assisted the prisoner in the assessment contended of his role in relation to this matter. The prisoner made no attempt to disguise his identity. He booked his accommodation and registered his mobile phone service in Australia in his own name. It was conceded he had an important role, but a limited one, and his involvement was for a limited period of time. His evidence sat comfortably with the facts. It was submitted that the offending fell at the bottom range of seriousness and I should give proper regard to his absence of criminal record as a matter relevant both subjectively and the assessment of the objective facts. It was also submitted he was remorseful and that there were special circumstances.

42I was referred to three judgments which I will refer to in a moment for comparative sentencing purposes. It was conceded that no issue arose of causal connection between any mental disability or mental illness with the offending behaviour.

43The Crown submitted that the offending was within the middle range of objective seriousness but conceded his role was not clear. The Crown initially submitted that he was a ""trusted member of the syndicate"" that had recruited him. Certainly great trust was placed in him, but I could not conclude that he was any relevant member of a syndicate as such. The Crown submitted that I should reject his evidence about his financial reward, but noted it would be difficult to assess his real role beyond what was known from the objective facts. The Crown submitted the prisoner sought to downplay his role and had not been truthful about his remuneration. The Crown did not oppose a finding of special circumstances and conceded that the prisoner in the context of all the evidence had good prospects of rehabilitation.

44This brings me to the comparative cases, because consideration of them raises a number of issues that are obviously pertinent in this sentencing exercise and clearly a consideration of Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The three cases to which learned Senior Counsel Mr Boulten referred me to were the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Hill [2012] NSWCCA 265, Wienand [2013] NSWCCA 202, and Ayik v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 119. Hill and Wienand were co-accused dealt with by the same judge at first instance but at different times, whose appeals came forward at different times. Ayik is an unrelated matter. Another judgment I have had regard, to that I was not referred to, is the decision of Buttrose [2011] NSWCCA 35, an appeal against sentence which I will refer to in a moment. 

45In the matters of Hill and Wienand the total quantity of drugs supplied that was common to the two offenders in a rolled-up charge related to four supplies over a one month period of a total of 1.75 kilograms of methylamphetamine with a purity that ranged between 3% and 4%. The accused Hill had introduced the two co-accused, Wienand and a man called Robinson, with Wienand obtaining the drugs from the head of the supply chain and delivering them to Robinson at the business premises of the prisoner. The prisoner had allowed his business premises to be used for the handing over of the drugs and stood guard to ensure that no one else walked in during the exchanges. Mr Hill also passed on information between Wienand and Robinson and was on occasion a go-between in negotiations on price. He did not profit greatly financially for his role, as I understood the facts receiving $1,000 for his involvement in one of the supplies. It is a little unclear as to what he received for the others.

46Mr Hill received a substantial discount for his plea of guilty and assistance amounting to 50%. The starting point of the sentence for him at first instance was 12 years imprisonment. He ended up with a head sentence of six years and a non-parole period of four years, but on appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal adjusted the sentence to a total sentence of three years with a non-parole period of two years, with a conclusion that the learned sentencing judge had not given sufficient weight to his powerful subjective case, particularly his proven history of industry and employment with a ""prodigious work ethic."" He was described as being ""naïve and gullible."" He also had a significant clinical condition that had rapidly deteriorated in custody because of the shock to him of being in custody for the first time. His role was identified as generally ""unsophisticated"" with little in the way of financial advantage. He also had considerable fears of being harmed by Mr Robinson and Mr Wienand, as well as fears for the safety of his family. He was of good character with no prior convictions with proven remorse and contrition, and with timely co-operation with the authorities.

47The Judge at first instance concluded that Wienand was higher up the ""supply chain"" than Hill, but for reasons that are not explained and obviously required some consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal, he made the starting point of the sentence for Mr Wienand ten years, ultimately fixing a total sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years and six months with a discount for the plea of guilty. Wienand, for some reason best known to himself, complained of a lack of parity with the outcome in Hill. But his appeal was dismissed by the majority. Apart from his greater role in the criminal enterprise, Mr Wienand had a less favourable subjective case and there was no suggestion of coercion as arose in Hill's matter. Wienand's criminality was regarded as below but not far below the mid-range of objective seriousness of such offences. Mr Wienand neither offered nor provided assistance to the authorities. The only positive features for him were some aspects of the objective case and some good prospects of rehabilitation. He had a minor criminal history although none for drug supply or use. 

48Mr Ayik was knowingly concerned with the supply of 28.75 kilograms of heroin and sentenced by her Honour Judge Flannery to nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five and a half years. The value of the drugs at wholesale level was 7.2 to $8 million. The applicant's role in the offence is that he stored the drugs at his own premises for a three day period and assisted in the transfer of drugs to someone ""higher in the hierarchy."" That person described in the facts as 'C' received a sentence of six years imprisonment with a discount of 50% for ""truly exceptional"" cooperation. The sentencing judge found that he had acted, that is Ayik had acted, under duress.

49Complaint was made on appeal for Ayik that parity principles demanded a lesser sentence for him. Other issues were raised but ultimately the appeal was dismissed. The Court proceeded on the assumption that the starting point of 12 years imprisonment was within the legitimate sentencing discretion for both men but for different reasons. Complaint was also made on appeal about a failure to reflect sufficient proportionality given C's greater total criminality, a point not raised at first instance. 

50One matter to be pointed out about these matters brought to my attention is the general proposition that every case is different and purported comparative cases only provide general assistance and guidance where the issue of a potential range of penalty arises for consideration from decisions of superior courts. Here, as in Hill, the accused had no prior criminal convictions and acted as a type of middleman, but Mr Hill's role was to some extent dictated by the character of his relationship with the two main players. Like this prisoner, he had an impressive established work record, but this prisoner does not have the significant psychological and medical impact upon him of incarceration, although there is impact upon him as the psychologist makes clear. Here it could be fairly said that the significance of the psychological evidence is not as great as it was in Hill. Of course, when one is comparing offenders with no prior criminal convictions who are mature adults with no significant antisocial personality disorders or prior conduct disorders, comparisons of subjective cases may only lead to marginal differences. 

51Here the prisoner was concerned with the transfer to a person he would have known was taking the drugs for distribution in Australia of a quantity that was only a few grams short of 3 kilograms. The precise weight, of course, he may not have known but, of course, he had to handle it to give it to Nguyen so he could place it in the backpack so he had a general idea as to its size. He should have reasonably have known, given the fact he was recruited in Canada to come to Australia for a Canadian crime group, that the drugs had been recently imported. Of course, he would not have known the precise level of purity but the objective facts are that the drugs in question had a very high level of purity as opposed to the fact in Hill and Wienand that the purity was at street level of 3 to 4%, greatly broken down methylamphetamine. Of course, there is no evidence that Mr Hill knew what level of purity were in the drugs but as the Court of Criminal Appeal observed there, as applies here by reference to the quantity, ""this was a significant quantity of methylamphetamine with a potential to cause widespread harm."" It should be further pointed out Mr Hill did not undertake any special arrangements to make himself available to act as a go-between as the prisoner did here. Here, the prisoner was recruited to be the courier, flew the Pacific to Australia obviously with instructions as to how he was to contact, or be contacted by, other people he did not know; that they tracked him down as he asserts means nothing so far as his role was concerned because that arrangement no doubt suited those that recruited the prisoner. His main concern was to do the task which he had been recruited for in a manner that suited his masters. There was no element of duress. Whilst the prisoner may fear some retribution from others hence his lack of cooperation with the authorities, this has not been positively asserted. There is no evidence of any particular threat to him or his family from the failure of his involvement.

52These other cases are of some assistance in the assessment of where this offence falls by relationship to an assessment of the 'middle range of objective seriousness'. One such case also is the case of Buttrose v The Queen, a case to which I was not taken (I particularly refer to [40] - [46] of that judgment). This is a case I have been taken to on a number of occasions before in other cases as providing some assistance in a comparative way. Of course, Mr Buttrose was dealt with for a number of supply offences but those offences included one offence contrary to s 25(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment. Buttrose was described as a person involved in ""large scale retail drug supply"" over a lengthy period of time including substantial quantities of prohibited drugs with significant profits, features that are absent here. He was in possession of $1.313 million at the time of his arrest being proceeds of crime, an offence to which he admitted his guilt, this was some measure of the profit available to him and others. 

53In the paragraphs above quoted the Court looked at a number of judgments involving sentences in relation to the supply of large quantities of prohibited drugs. Each of the cases cited involves significantly greater quantities of prohibited drugs than here. Of course, some of the cases quoted in the paragraphs I have cited involve significantly greater discounts for the accommodation of pleas of guilty and cooperation, although some of the cases involve no discounts at all. Such as the decision of Wang [2009] NSWCCA 223. Mr Wang was a retail dealer who pleaded 'not guilty'. When one looks at those various authorities, including the outcome in Buttrose, and sees the assessment of the offending by reference to the middle range of offending for like offences and considering relevant matters such as the character of the reward, the role of the prisoner and the like, one can better assess where this offence stands. These other judgments do provide some assistance in relation not only to the range of penalty but also the assessment of where this offence may be assessed by reference to the middle range of objective seriousness. I need not go over the circumstances of the various roles of the other offenders but I note in relation to Hill, he was assessed as being below but not far below the middle range of objective seriousness. I note in relation to Hill, of course, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed in dealing with the appeal that that assessment was not ""controversial."" 

54On one view of it, whilst the role of this prisoner was straightforward he had the responsibility of looking after the drugs delivered to him and then delivering them to another person. In that sense, it was an unsophisticated role. I have already indicated I accept the prisoner has displayed in his evidence and by his involvement in this matter given his background a considerable degree of naivety. However, he performed this role in the context of an understanding that he was being recruited in a scheme of international drug distribution which would include consideration of the mechanisms of importing these drugs to avoid detection and did so in circumstances where he had made himself available to be contacted by other people who had been given information about his identity to enable them apparently to surreptitiously deliver the drugs to him and have him deliver them to others. The overall scheme could not be described unsophisticated, his role was important but simple. He was also disposable. I have no doubt that he was not one of the organisers or financiers of the enterprise. The Crown used the expression, in fairness to the learned Crown Prosecutor he did correct it, that the prisoner was a ""trusted member"" of the syndicate. I could not conclude reasonably as I said earlier that he was a ""member"" of any syndicate in the sense that he participated in relevant decision making and profit taking that would connote membership.

55As has been pointed out in a number of cases including the Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Lee, the sentencing judge is truly ignorant of the character of an organisation responsible for organising crimes of this type. People arrested do not carry around in their pockets organisation charts of the organisation that they represent. What the Court can do is as the High Court made clear in Olbrich, on the objective facts, assess precisely what the prisoner did. The evidence of the prisoner's mother and the evidence otherwise available as to his background and the absence of criminal convictions show that the prisoner was vulnerable to temptation. He was clearly no criminal mastermind as was his inability to disguise himself and he was clearly lured into this enterprise by the offer of short term financial gain without any real consideration of the consequences. The prisoner's naivety was reflected to some extent by the use of his own name to register at the Quest Apartments and to register the mobile service in his own name. The truth of the matter was that either because of his own lack of sophistication or because of his stupidity, or the stupidity of his masters, he was an obvious open target for the authorities who were investigating this matter. There is no evidence that this prisoner exchanged any money for the drugs that were delivered to him either, or that he delivered to Mr Nguyen.

56Having regard to what can be established as to his role and examine closely what he did in the context of the objective facts I have come to the conclusion of the objective seriousness of the offences below the middle range of objective seriousness. I do not accept the submission, if I have correctly recorded it not having a transcript, that the offending is at a 'low level'. I appreciate, of course, the authorities that indicate that the quantity of the drugs supplied are imported it is not necessarily a determinant of the objective seriousness of the offending, the role of the offender is one that may take into account the quantity but it is not determinative. I also note that the offender was recruited for a relatively short period of time to perform the middle man or warehousing function that he did without knowledge as to the precise quantity or the purity of the drugs. But he was recruited in a foreign land and he came to this country to commit a serious crime with obvious potential adverse impacts upon our citizens and residents. The mere fact that he had to travel across the world whatever the financial reward was to be in circumstances where he remained in this country for over a fortnight before he actually committed the crime making himself available to be contacted by others and readying himself for the task at hand shows his devotion to his responsibility in this regard. The prisoner had ample opportunity to reflect upon what he was doing and he could not claim he was the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time. He had no obligation to agree to commit the crime, he was in need of money but difficult financial circumstances are not an excuse or mitigating factor. 

57In terms of matters that arise as aggravating factors under s 21A(2) the most prominent aggravating factor although it is at least implicitly a feature of this type of offending in all occasions, was that the offence was committed for financial reward. This was the aspect of the prisoner's evidence I found most unconvincing but not to the extent that would cause me to disbelieve other aspects of his evidence. I have already pointed out what he claimed that he was to receive. He seem to prevaricate as to whether he was to take his living expenses out of the modest amount he claimed he was to be paid. Even accepting for the moment that he lived cheaply for a period of time until he moved in the Quest Apartments at Bondi Junction, there clearly must have been a number of expenses he would have incurred transport, food, accommodation, cost of the mobile phone and other out-of-pockets. I cannot accept that he was only to be paid $4,000 Canadian to perform the role that he agreed to perform, but what he was to receive I cannot say. Certainly, I am prepared to accept he was not to receive anything other than a modest amount of money, in context, but the precise amount is impossible to identify. As I said in his evidence he seemed to treat this matter as a paid holiday. This is an explanation that does not sit squarely with other material suggesting that he committed the offence for out of financial necessity having no home, not having a job until he returned to Canada in June 2013 and having been the beneficiary of his sister's largesse for a period of nearly 12 months before he committed this crime. Obviously, he could not work for those 12 months but the evidence he gave did not sit squarely with his reasons otherwise express for committing this offence. So far as this is an aggravating factor, it is to be fairly said an aggravating factor to be assessed in the context of the types of financial advantage that may be received. There was obviously also a degree of planning in the commission of the offence, but so far as this prisoner's involvement in the crime was concerned, the planning that he was directly concerned with was not of such a character beyond that which would be normally expected in the commission of such an offence to make it a relevant aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act. 

58In relation to matters arising under s 21A(3) I accept that the prisoner was a person of prior good character without criminal convictions; that he has good prospects of rehabilitation; that he is not likely to offend again; that he has expressed remorse and taken responsibility for his actions although not in a timely fashion and that he has pleaded guilty for which he receives obviously a discreet discount. In relation to the prisoner not given any pre-trial disclosure but is warranting a finding of a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3). 

59With regard to this matter, of course, I am required to have regard to the amended provisions of Pt 4 Div 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 54A(2) in its amended form now provides that:

60""For the purposes of sentencing an offender the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this Division that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.""

61Section 54B(2) provides:

""The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a Court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.""

62Those other matters, of course, matters such as those that might arise under s 21A(3). The repeal of the previously worded s 54B and the phrase, ""is to set"" has left the situation now that the Court is to regard the standard non-parole period not of determinative significance in the sentencing exercise but one of a number of matters that are required to be considered particularly in the context of the judgment of the High Court in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357, particularly in the judgment of McHugh J at [51], and of course the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, particularly at [20] to [29]. 

63In this matter, I have made a finding of 'special circumstances'. In the sentencing the offender I have concluded that I should adjust the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of sentence. I am mindful of the fact the prisoner will be deported on his release from custody. But that is not a basis for concluding that there is not a finding of special circumstances nor should I not determine a non-parole period. The relevant matters to the determination of special circumstances of this matter are the need to provide the prisoner with professional assistance on his release to the community to adjust to community living. The fact that the prisoner whilst in custody will have various hardships of being in custody for the first time and being disconnected from family and friends. He will need professional guidance on his release to deal with some of the contributing factors to his offending particularly matters relating to his problematic use of prohibited drugs and obviously his financial management. There are also, of course, present mental health issues that may need addressing by what would ordinarily be expected of supervision.

64In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to s 3A of the Act, the purposes of sentencing. Clearly there is a need for adequate punishment and the need to deter this offender and others from committing similar offences. The community's protection is not paramount in this matter in one sense because the prisoner per se does not present a danger to the community, although the consequences of this offending could have caused damage to the community had the drugs been disseminated. I am also required, however, to promote his rehabilitation, make him accountable for his actions and to denounce his conduct. 

65As I foreshadowed to the prisoner taking all relevant matters into consideration I have concluded that the starting point for any sentence to be imposed should be a term of eight years six months imprisonment with a discount of 25% for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, the sentence to be imposed will be six years and five months imprisonment. As I have earlier indicated, I have concluded there are special circumstances I thus propose to fix a non-parole period of three years ten months with the balance of sentence of two years seven months. Thanks very much, Mr Birnie, you can stand up.

66In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of three years and ten months that shall date from 5 June 2013, the date you came into custody, and expire on 4 April 2017. I fix a balance of sentence of two years seven months to expire on 4 November 2019. It will be a matter for the Parole Authority whether you are released to parole, I cannot direct that you be released to parole at the expiry of your non-parole period. You can take a seat, thanks very much.

67HIS HONOUR: Yes, Mr Crown, any technical matters from you, any matters from you, Mr Hanna?

68HANNA: Your Honour, only in relation to the discount, the sentence after your Honour takes into account the 25% discount. It maybe a matter on which nothing turns but if I could just bring it to your Honour's attention, your Honour stated that the starting point would be eight years and six months with a 25% discount that is six years and five months. I accept that there is no requirement for the discount to be exactly 25%.

69HIS HONOUR: I should have explained, I have rounded up the total sentence but I have rounded down the non-parole period. Would you like me to round up the non-parole period, Mr Hanna?

70HANNA: Certainly not, your Honour.

71HIS HONOUR: No, seriously, would you like me to do that?

72HANNA: Certainly not, your Honour.

73HIS HONOUR: I apologise to you, I should have said, I have rounded it up to an even month so I have brought it up to 77 months but I have rounded down the non-parole period about .3 of a month.

74HANNA: Thank you, your Honour.

75HIS HONOUR: What I have given away with one hand I have taken back with the other.

76HANNA: Thank you.

77HIS HONOUR: I do not think to the detriment of your client, with respect. Yes, thank you, Mr Birnie, you are excused.

2763426,AV8 Air Charter Pty Limited v Sydney Helicopters Pty Limited [2014] NSWCA 46,"Judgment
1BARRETT JA:  For the reasons stated by Hoeben JA, this appeal must be dismissed with costs
2HOEBEN JA:Nature of appealThe appeal concerns an economic loss claim founded upon allegations of negligence and breach of contract from the flying of a civilian helicopter that was damaged when it struck a suspended overhead powerline.  The accident occurred on 29 January 2009 while the helicopter was on a flight from Scone to Sydney.  
3The appellant owned the helicopter.  The respondent was the bailee of that helicopter and Mr Harrold, the respondent's pilot, was in control of the helicopter at the time of the wire strike.  The appellant sought damages for the diminution in the resale value of the helicopter and the loss of profits during the period it could not be used or hired while it was under repair.  It was common ground that the Civil Liability Act 2002 (CLA) applied to these proceedings.
4A summary of the accident is that in deteriorating weather conditions the helicopter descended below cloud level near Broke and flew on for several minutes after that descent before it struck a powerline that was suspended along a valley located in restricted military airspace near Singleton Army Base in NSW.  The presence of that powerline was not indicated on the map being the Visual Navigation Chart (VNC) that was then available to Mr Harrold.
5The issue argued before this Court was whether the respondent's pilot had been negligent.  There were, however, a number of subsidiary issues including contract and the apportionment provisions of the CLA.  The oral submissions on the appeal differed somewhat from the written submissions.  The oral submissions challenged crucial aspects of the judge's fact finding.  The Court must therefore make its own independent assessment of the facts and give effect to its conclusions about them (Fox v PercyI [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at [21] - [25], [27]).  The Court must weigh conflicting evidence and draw its own inferences and conclusions - bearing in mind, however, that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses - and having due regard to those findings of fact of the trial judge which have not been challenged (Warren v Coombs [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531; Vero Insurance Limited v Rail Corporation of NSW [2013] NSWCA 372 at [8] - [9]).
6An important issue in the appeal was the availability of the findings which the trial judge made about the prevailing weather conditions and the extent and location of the cloud cover which restricted the movement of the aircraft.  The appellant submitted that taking Mr Harrold's evidence at its highest did not justify the findings which the trial judge made.
7The particular findings of the trial judge which were impugned were at [108], [110] - [118], [120] - [127], [173] - [180], [182] - [187], [218] - [219].  The findings by his Honour in those paragraphs were to the effect that the deteriorating weather conditions and increase in cloud gave Mr Harrold little option but to make the choice which he did.  His Honour stressed that his options needed to be looked at prospectively in order to assess the reasonableness of the choices which he made.  In order to assess the availability of those findings, it is necessary to analyse the evidence on this issue.
Factual background and findings in the District Court
8As a start point I propose to review the facts generally, paying particular attention to the findings made by the trial judge and the basis for them.
9Factual evidence was given by the following witnesses:
(i) Mr Paradice was a passenger in the helicopter and owned a controlling interest in the appellant.
(ii) Mr Harrold was the Managing Director of the respondent and the pilot flying the helicopter at the time of the wire strike.
(iii) Mr Hodge was an employee of the respondent and a helicopter pilot who was a passenger in the helicopter at the time of the wire strike.
(iv) Mr Franks was a helicopter pilot who in 1994 had flown a helicopter over the area in the course of effecting repairs to a powerline damaged by a wire strike with a helicopter.
(v) Mr Hopkins was an Aviation Assessor with QBE Insurance.
(vi) Mr Dunscombe was the pilot of an NSW Police helicopter that had struck the same wire located on the southern boundary of the Singleton Army Training Area (SATA) on 23 March 1994.  He provided a statement.
10Four experts gave evidence.
(i) Mr Nest was a Senior Helicopter Flight Trainer and Check Captain with over 25 years' experience in operating helicopters, both in the RAAF and in a civilian setting.  He had extensive experience in consulting and risk assessment matters, had flown more than 6,408 hours in helicopters at the time he wrote his report and was retained as an expert by the appellant.
(ii) Mr Daniel Tyler was a helicopter pilot who had flown helicopters in combat and civilian conditions.  His experience was in Australia and overseas.  His helicopter flying hours at the time of writing his report were in excess of 11,000 and he was retained as an expert witness for the appellant.
(iii) Mr Davies was a former RAAF Flying Instructor, who had extensive experience as an RAAF pilot since 1984 in numerous capacities including as an instructor.  At the time of giving evidence he was a pilot on an A380 air bus but had extensive experience in flying safety issues in connection with military and civilian aviation.  At the time he gave evidence his accumulated flying experience was 13,250 hours.  He was retained as an expert by the respondent.
(iv) Mr Townsend had extensive experience in the aviation field over the course of 38 years.  He had flown helicopters for 30 years as an instructor and had accumulated 19,000 hours in helicopters.  He was retained as an expert by the respondent.
One of the challenges to the fact finding of the trial judge was that he paid insufficient attention to the opinion of these experts.
11In oral submissions on the appeal, the appellant identified the negligence of the respondent as:
(a) Flying in restricted airspace in contravention of Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 140.  
""So it's a significant part of the plaintiff's case at trial that when Mr Harrold perceived that he could not fly further south on his visual flight rules licence because of the cloud descending to the ridges, when he considered turning across to the east, which he said he did, and in consultation with this map, basic navigation would have told him that he couldn't skirt to the north of the high country, which had the clouds descending to the top of it without intruding into the restricted airspace.""  (Appeal Transcript (AT) 5.29 - .35)
(b) Flying below a safe altitude and at a height lower than 500 feet above the highest point of terrain within a radius of 300 metres at a point on the terrain vertically below the aircraft in contravention of CAR 157.
(c) "" ... there was, in the evidence, no pressure of weather or other circumstance which justified him flying so close to the steeply rising ground, and that what did cause him to fly so close to the steeply rising ground was that he knew that he was either in restricted airspace or just outside it, and he was deliberately keeping as far southerly as he could and as close to that steep escarpment as he could in order to be in minimal intrusion on the army training area and as far from its activities as he possibly could be.
He in effect said that in his evidence.  That's why he was flying in that manner and he got himself into that situation because of the serious error of navigation that he made at Broke or about Broke when he turned left or east and headed out to take a track which his air navigation chart showed would sandwich him between high ground with cloud on the top of it and a restricted area that he should not have been flying over, and it would force him to fly southerly and force him to fly low.""  (AT 7.50 - 8.15)
12The following data was used by the parties, both at trial and in the appeal.  At the relevant time the helicopter was travelling at approximately 90 knots, which is the equivalent of 150 kilometres an hour.  Heights are given in feet and were either ""above height datum"" (AHD) or ""above mean sea level"" (AMSL).  Heights were also given ""above ground level"" (AGL).  This latter measurement was important because CAR 157 required that an aircraft should not fly lower than 500 feet above ground level and ground level was determined to be the highest point of ground in a radius of 300 metres from the point immediately below the aircraft.
13Exhibit F was the Visual Navigation Chart (VNC) which Mr Harrold was using for the flight.  It is common ground that this chart was in the cockpit of the helicopter at the time.  It is obvious from an examination of it that it is a very small scale map.  It does not show contours, it merely depicts major features such as towns, roads and rivers.  For example, the Singleton Army Training Area (SATA) is designated by a red boundary line, but no physical features were shown whereby the actual boundary could be determined.  In evidence the SATA was also described as ""the Singleton Field Firing Range"", ""the Singleton Army Base, Dochra"" and as R532A and R564A.  It was common ground that the airspace above the SATA was restricted airspace.
14His Honour found that no credit issues arose in relation to the witnesses.  He concluded that their evidence was to be assessed by reference to its inherent reliability.
15The following evidence was uncontroversial.  Mr Harrold had been a licensed helicopter pilot since 2002.  He had been the Managing Director of the respondent since 2008.  At the time of the wire strike, he was endorsed to fly the EC 120 model helicopter and had previously accumulated about 48 hours flying time on such helicopters.  He had held a commercial helicopter pilot's licence since 2006 and was authorised to fly only in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules (VFR) established by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).  In accordance with that licence, Mr Harrold was not allowed to fly through cloud, was required to keep sight of the ground at least every 30 minutes, and not fly by instrumentation alone.
16The parties had a relatively short-lived commercial relationship with respect to helicopter hire and charter activities.  They had entered into an agreement in 2008 whereby the appellant permitted the respondent to manage, charter and operate a helicopter of the Robinson R44 type belonging to the appellant.  Against that background, the parties had discussions concerning a proposed commercial basis for the appellant to acquire a Eurocopter EC 120B helicopter to be also operated by the respondent.  On 16 December 2008 the appellant purchased the subject EC 120B helicopter from its previous US based owners in New Zealand.
17In August 2008 Mr Harrold sent Mr Paradice a draft agreement setting out the terms on which the respondent would enter into contractual relations for the proposed charter and operation of an EC 120B helicopter.  That draft was not executed by the parties, but a further copy was forwarded to Mr Paradice on 18 January 2009.  On 28 January 2009 the appellant's EC 120B helicopter was delivered to the respondent's heliport at Rosehill.  This was the helicopter involved in the wire strike.
18At 11pm on 28 January 2009 the Bureau of Meteorology issued an area forecast from that time of issue to 4pm on 29 January 2009 in respect of the proposed flight area.  At 4am on 29 January 2009 the Bureau issued an amended area forecast to include a warning of fog and mist patches for that area for the period from the time of issue, to 8am on 29 January 2009.
19At about 7am on 29 January 2009 Mr Harrold undertook the required pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and then he and Mr Hodge took off from the respondent's heliport at Rosehill.  At about 8am the helicopter landed at Mr Paradice's property at Wingham, north of Scone.  Shortly after 8am Mr Paradice boarded the aircraft and the flight to Sydney commenced.  
20During the flight to Sydney at about 8.30am Mr Harrold encountered some cloud.  He decided that he should take the aircraft into a descent in order to fly under the cloud.  Subsequently at about 8.45am the aircraft struck a suspended overhead powerline.  Although the helicopter was forced to land, no serious injury was suffered by either the pilot or the passengers.  
21The location of the wire strike was the same location where on 23 March 1994 a Polair helicopter had struck unmarked, overhead powerlines.  No markers were installed on the overhead powerlines when they were replaced after that incident.
22An important issue in the appeal was the availability of the findings which the trial judge made as to the prevailing weather conditions and the extent and location of the cloud cover.  The appellant submitted that even if one took Mr Harrold's evidence at its highest, it did not justify the findings which the trial judge made.  In essence, the appellant submitted that there was no proper evidentiary basis for those findings.
23The particular findings of the trial judge which were impugned were:
""106 ... I am also satisfied that as the aircraft proceeded to fly along the designated track towards Sydney, Mr Harrold saw an area of cloud ahead that was broken in places, but as he continued on that flight, the cloud became more dense. He recognised that he should avoid flying over that dense cloud, in accordance with the well-known VFR safety requirements to which his licence was subject.
...
108 I am also satisfied that because of the presence of such cloud, Mr Harrold correctly identified the need to find a clear area around the cloud in order to make a descent to a cruising level below that cloud formation so as to maintain visual observation of the ground. I accept that he found an opportunity to make that descent near the township of Broke, where he made the descent and then turned the helicopter to the left to track generally east towards Cessnock to avoid that bank of low lying cloud and to seek out an alternative route that was not impeded by cloud or weather. The choice of Cessnock meant that if need be, he would have the opportunity to refuel, a matter he had to consider now that a change was required to his original flight plan to avoid flying through cloud.  
...
110 I accept that at that time, Mr Harrold was flying the helicopter at about 90 knots, and was aware of the presence of some wind and cloud movement, and was not able to accurately discern the speed at which that cloud was moving, except to recognise that the cloud, described as deteriorating weather, was closing in from behind him, moving from his left towards his right, or approximately from the west to the east, as he flew away from it in order to avoid such cloud.
...
112 I also accept that in response to this deteriorating weather, Mr Harrold was aware of the need to maintain the safety of the aircraft and his passengers. He was at that time concerned to look for a way of avoiding flying through cloud, and at the same time, maintain adherence to the VFR requirements.
...
119 In the course of these events, on a number of occasions, Mr Harrold intermittently took the opportunity to look at, and to check, his VNC map to appraise his other safe options. At that time those options were rather limited due to evolving problems with the weather, namely, the cloud that was moving in from behind.
120 In those evolving events, Mr Harrold knew that he was flying into a valley, the southern border of which was the restricted military area that comprised the Singleton Army Base. At this time he was in effect in something of an emergency situation as he could not safely turn back because of the low cloud that had closed in behind him, and he therefore had very few options available to him. ...
121 I find that the circumstances in which Mr Harrold then found himself in were not normal flying conditions, and he needed to fly away from the weather, or the clouds, that were still closing in from behind. These events necessarily limited Mr Harrold's options, including for turning back.
122 Of the options that were then available to him, he chose to fly east and track along the northern side of the Great Dividing Range, in an attempt to avoid the problematic cloudbank referred to earlier. In order to do so, at some stage he had to pass over the Great Dividing Range. He took that course knowing that he would have to fly near the southern border of the restricted military area. This was because the ridge or spur of Mt Broken Back was ahead as marked on his VNC map, and the terrain to his right was rising towards the cloud cover.
123 He intended to skirt the southern edge of the restricted military area in taking that course. That decision was driven by the behaviour of the clouds. He consulted the VNC map for reassurance, gauging what he saw on that map in correlation with the landform features before him, as would have been expected of a pilot navigating in those circumstances. He interpreted this data as providing a safe and clear flight path towards Cessnock.
...
125 In the course of that flight, part of the mountain range to the east had started to protrude into the low-lying cloud as the terrain rose ahead of him as he aimed for Cessnock. He had taken a course that had cleared the range and he considered that he had cleared the Army Base as well. Although there was low cloud cover in the immediate area that had spread to his right and to the south, he saw clearer sky to the east.
126 As he was heading east in those events, his altitude was approximately 1850' above sea level, but as the terrain to his right was rising with the hills. He was therefore much closer to the ground than 1850' as he continued to proceed east with the low cloud above him.
127 In the course of those events, he encountered the overhead powerline that was immediately in front of him. The powerline was unmarked, and in that moment he had no opportunity to avoid striking it. ... (Red 60G - 64T)
24In order to assess the appellant's attack on those findings of fact, it is necessary to set out parts of the evidence on this issue.
25Mr Paradice gave evidence.  Where that evidence conflicted with that of Mr Harrold, his Honour preferred the evidence of Mr Harrold.  There was no challenge in oral submissions in the appeal to that conclusion by the trial judge.  In the appellant's written submissions, however, this appears implicitly to be challenged, at least in part (AWS [69] - [77], Orange 24N-25K).  In oral submissions the attack on Mr Harrold's evidence was to the effect that it was not capable of supporting the findings of the trial judge.  I have approached this issue on the basis of the oral submissions made by senior counsel on the appeal.
26Mr Paradice said that during the 10-30 seconds before the wire strike he had asked Mr Harrold why they were flying so close to the cliffs.  Mr Harrold agreed that such a conversation had taken place, the details of which were set out at par 160 of his statement of 5 October 2011 as follows:
""Mr Paradice why are we flying close to the range?ME:  We have a restricted area to the left and we have hills to the right.  I cannot fly through the cloud and the terrain is rising to the south.""  (Blue 325H)
27Mr Paradice said that from the time of the left turn after the descent near Broke until the time of the wire strike, the aircraft did not fly through cloud but he observed that there were ""misty"" conditions below the aircraft.  He said that at that time he could see a couple of hundred metres in front reasonably well.
28Mr Hodge held a Civil Aviation rating endorsement for this type of helicopter.  He occupied the left front seat position for the flight.  He recalled the flight to Scone as uneventful in sunny and clear skies and he did not leave the aircraft at Scone.  Mr Hodge's evidence substantially confirmed that of Mr Harrold.  Where they disagreed, his Honour preferred Mr Harrold.  No challenge to that finding was made in oral submissions in the appeal.  
29Mr Hodge described the flight plan from Scone to Sydney as a straight line from Scone to Mascot.  He had the VNC map on his lap for most of the flight.  On the flight from Scone he observed a bank of low-lying cloud to the south between Muswellbrook and Broke coming from the west and which obscured the view of the mountain range directly to the south.  He said that there was a northern edge to that cloud bank and it was approaching the edge of the mountain range.  He said that he had a clear view ahead to the mountain range.  He said that at that time the aircraft was cruising at an altitude of about 2,500 feet.
30Mr Hodge said that the flight had been unexceptionable until the aircraft commenced a descent at a point between Muswellbrook and Broke when the weather started to deteriorate with cloud moving from left to the right of the aircraft during the descent.  He described the OCTAS rating of the cloud at that point as five, which is defined as meaning three-eighths of the sky was clear in front with plenty of gaps in the clouds so as to provide clear vision down to the terrain below and in front.  Mr Hodge could not see the cloud behind him.  As the aircraft tracked further south towards Broke, he noticed a continuing build up of low-lying cloud ahead.  Before reaching Broke, he observed Mr Harrold to consult the VNC map for a period of not more than two minutes, during which time he took over control of the flight.
31Just before the aircraft reached Broke, Mr Hodge remembered Mr Harrold saying words to the following effect:
Harrold: ""We should go round the Army Base and head east.  It is best not to attempt to go over the mountains.  It may be clear of clouds over the other side of the mountains but we do not know what the weather is like on the other side.  
If there is low-lying cloud over the other side of the range I may not be able to get through to land.
If we go east we will also have two refuelling options if we need them.""  (Blue 402X)
32Mr Hodge said that Mr Harrold then proceeded to track to the east and fly between the southern side of the Singleton Army Base on his left and inclining mountain ranges to his right.  Mr Hodge observed low lying cloud that was building up to the north and to the south, but a clear run of weather through to Cessnock and Newcastle.
33Mr Hodge said that had he felt uncomfortable about the proximity of the ranges to the helicopter to the south or as to the helicopter's height, he would have said something to Mr Harrold.  He said that he did not recall feeling anxious or in danger at any time because of Mr Harrold's decision to fly east past the Singleton Army Base.  It was Mr Hodge's evidence that as they flew east, they had clear full visibility of everything in front but not to the north.  He said:
""A.  There was low lying cloud moving, it would have been moving in behind us from moving west to east.""
34After the aircraft had turned to the east, Mr Hodge's recollection was that there was clear visibility of the land below but he was not able to say how much low lying cloud there was.
35Mr Harrold prepared two evidentiary statements dated 5 October 2011 and 17 February 2012.  He was cross-examined extensively on those statements.  He also provided CASA with a written notification of the wire strike incident.  Mr Harrold's evidence as to what happened during the flight is set out in his October statement as follows:
""144 During the flight the low cloud I had seen to the South on my trip to Scone had moved North and I noticed that the weather had begun to change.  I was travelling about 162 degrees South.  I saw that the cloud was developing in front of me to the South, South-East and East.  
145 There was also cloud to the West and North-West of the helicopter.
146 The Visual Flight Rules prevented me from travelling through cloud.  Based on my assessment the cloud was lowering to the south where I had to clear a mountain range forming part of the Great Dividing Range.
147  The available options for me were:
(a) To attempt to fly above the cloud.
(b) To attempt to fly underneath the cloud at the same time as trying to clear the Great Dividing Range; or
(c) To head Eastwards in an attempt to avoid the cloud bank and pass over the Great Dividing Range in doing so.
148 I was not prepared to attempt to fly above the cloud bank.  The difficulty with this course was that I was not sure there would be a break in the clouds at my destination which would enable me to land.  There was the possibility that I might be caught above the cloud.
149 I was also worried about the possibility of attempting to fly underneath the cloud bank at the same time as trying to clear the ridge of the Great Dividing Range which lay to the South of my location.
150 It was a possibility that if I attempted this I would get squeezed between the ridge and the low cloud bank without any room to progress and may inadvertently enter cloud.
151 There was also no available refuelling stations along that course if I had to reverse course due to an inability to clear the mountain range.
152 At about this time I asked Roger to handle the controls while I called a friend of mine located in Newcastle, Mr Stephen Forgacs, to get an idea of the weather there.  He did not answer and so I left a message on his voicemail.  I received a reply text from Mr Forgacs soon after confirming that the weather was deteriorating on the coast near the Hunter River.  
153 I consulted the VNC map which identified the air space and the terrain in this particular area.  I wanted to determine the best course to adopt.  Throughout the flight Roger had this VNC map open on his lap.  
29 January 2009 - Course Correction
154 I had already passed Mount Wambo and Bulga and decided that I would continue towards Broke.
155 I remained below the cloud to enable me to adhere to VFR and to give me full vision of the range in the cloud bank in front of me.
156 On approaching Broke and avoiding any low lying cloud I continued to track east towards Cessnock and Newcastle.  I did this because:(a)  I was unable to fly through the approaching cloud to the south; (b)  I am not an instrument rated pilot and my licence does not allow me to fly through cloud.(c) VH-EDP ( the helicopter) was not set up for instrumentation only flying.(d) The terrain to the south was becoming high.(e) By tracking East I had available to me two safe options in Cessnock and potentially Newcastle for landing if the weather was to deteriorate further or if I needed to refuel.
157 I was aware that Singleton Army Base was a restricted area to my left.  This was identified on the VNC map.  I remained under the low flying cloud and based on my interpretation of the land forms set out on the VNC map, kept outside the perimeter of the no fly zone of the Army Base.  At no time did I intentionally enter restricted airspace.
158 I could see straight ahead to the East towards Cessnock.  I recall that the visibility was clearer to the east, still cloud, however, the clearance between the base of the cloud and the ground appeared far greater.
159 I crossed the range and flew between the mountain range (now to my Southern right hand side) and the Army Base (now to my Northern left hand side) and under the cloud.  I was concerned with remaining in sight of the ground and to safely navigate around the ridge and the Army Base. 
...
29 January 2009 - The Wire Strike
161 As we tracked to the east, the range to the right protruded up into the cloud.  As the cloud was low lying I could not see the top of the range to my right, although I could see straight ahead.
162 We were approaching Cessnock.  At this point I was now clear of the range and the Army Base area and descending towards Cessnock.  The range was about 50 metres on my right hand or southern side.  The weather to the immediate east looked much better.  The low lying cloud had spread across the rest of the sky to my south.  I remained in sight of land at all times and never entered cloud.
163 The altitude of the helicopter at this time was approximately 1850 feet above sea level.
164 It was at this point I noticed a wire in front of us from right to left and the helicopter struck the wire no less than one second later.""
36On 30 January 2009 Mr Harrold provided CASA with a formal written notification.  This was to similar effect as his statement albeit more brief.  The relevant parts of the narrative are:
""We departed the private residence at 0805 and headed South on route to Sydney, the Upper Hunter Valley was cloud free, however, as we tracked further south it became evident that there was cloud developing South of Mount Wambo and extending overhead the mountain country to the South, whilst this cloud appeared broken and flight may have been possible on top of cloud while still maintaining a visual reference of the ground within a 30 minute window, I was not confident of being able to descend as I got closer to Sydney and was also mindful of the fuel available if indeed I had to turn back.  So this option I considered unacceptable and unsafe.
As a result, I elected to track along the northern side of the range in a south-easterly direction for Cessnock then onward to either Kurri Kurri or Muldring, depending on how the weather looked.  I was referring to the VNC 3 Newcastle Chart, effective 20 November 2008, which showed a clear passage free of wires and south of the Dochra area to Cessnock.  We passed abeam Broke clear of cloud and with approx 500 foot clearance above ground and then south of the Dochra area.  We then rounded the southern part of the Dochra area and headed for Cessnock, it was at this point that we struck the wire near the hill marked 1942.""
37The notification form indicated that at the time of the wire strike, visibility had been reduced by cloud, with the cloud cover being 5-7 OCTA, which is described as broken cloud.  As the expert evidence pointed out, an OCTA is a meteorological term identifying in fractions of 8 the part of the sky obscured by cloud where 8 meant total cloud cover.
38At a meeting on 2 February 2009 at the CASA offices in Bankstown, Mr Harrold again recounted what had happened leading up to the wire strike:
""I explained I had better visibility to the east towards Cessnock and proceeded in that direction.  I tracked over part of the range remaining clear of cloud and to my north I had good clearance however the dochra area was in that direction which I did not want to breach.  I was referring to the Newcastle VNC map in order for me to identify as best I could the boundary of the restricted area whilst dealing with the deteriorating weather.  I was attempting to identify the geographical features of the range back to the map to ensure I did not encroach on the restricted area.  I could see the large powerlines running in an east west direction on the valley floor and located them on the map, I believed myself to be out of the restricted area and I was conscious of staying out of the restricted area.
I then crossed over part of the range to the valley en route to Cessnock where I could land or continue on towards Mulbring then coastal to Sydney.  I explained that my path across the range looked clear on the chart, there were no masts or powerlines indicated.  This gave me a sense of security whilst dealing with the stress of weather and the pressure of getting Mr Pardice to Sydney.  ...""
39Mr Harrold's second statement, dated 17 February 2012, relevantly provides:
""12 My track down from Scone was a little to the East of due South.  After I descended through the cloud and as Captain Nest paraphrases in his paragraph 6(d), there was low cloud to the north, low cloud obscuring the high ground to the south, but reasonable helicopter conditions to the Northeast and East.  
13 I saw that the low cloud to the north also extended westwards.  I saw that the cloud to the north and west (referred to in my original statement in paragraph 145) was something like the profile of a mountain range turned upside down.  That is, you could see a solid top to the cloud but underneath patches of cloud extend downwards to various heights (so that there was scattered clouds at a similar altitude to mine), with some low lying patches of mist below around Broke and which, to the best of my recollection, obscured Broke (possibly from the Wollombi Brook and other bodies of water nearby).  It appeared to me that the weather behind me was closing in with some cloud moving west to east.
14 Around this point of time with the weather as I have described above having descended below the cloud and having received the text message from Stephen Forgacs (paragraph 152 of my original statement), I had to make a decision (with the assistance of VNC 3).
15 I decided not to continue south for the reasons given in my original statement.
16 I couldn't track north east because that would have taken me through the middle of SATA (Singleton Army Training Area) and close to the firing ranges shown in the north east quadrant of SATA as shown in Annexure A.
17 Having seen the weather behind me (to the north and west) I considered that flying north involved risks with the cloud.  I had already descended beneath the cloud for the reasons I gave in my original statement and I did not want to ascend above that cloud because I did not know when, and if, I would be able to sight the ground again or successfully penetrate the cloud layer whilst ascending.
18 I did not consider landing at Broke to be a good option.  There was no airfield (unlike Cessnock and Newcastle), there were various mines and there was low lying mist.  I was not familiar with the town of Broke and did not know of any safe places to land.  I had been taught never to fly low over mines because of the risk of explosive devices being triggered.  I was also concerned with the cloud I had seen moving from west to east (towards Broke) that, depending upon how the weather developed may have made landing at Broke more dangerous.
19 Towards the east, as I said in paragraph 158 of my original statement, I could see that the visibility was clearer and brighter, although there was still some cloud and the clearance between the ground and the base of the cloud was greater.  Captain Nest seems to confirm this in his paragraph 6(d) where he says that the cloud base to the east (and north east) varied between 500 feet and 1000 feet above ground level.
20 Once over the range, the ground then fell away substantially so that even though my altitude would not change substantially, my height above ground would.
21 With the limitations of VNC 3, as to the boundaries of the restricted area, the cloud to the east being a reasonable height above ground and no powerlines marked on VNC 3, other than the main transmission lines well to the north, my judgment was that the safest option in the circumstances was to hug the southern boundary of the restricted area and fly in this 500 to 1000 foot clearance between the ground and the base of the cloud for a few kilometres until I reached Cessnock or perhaps Newcastle where I could land safely if the weather was to deteriorate further.  By the time I made this decision and commenced tracking east I estimate I was about a couple of nautical miles south of Broke.
22 It is correct to say that this course involved a short distance of low flying and the need to hug the boundary of the restricted area but the visibility was clear and in the circumstances of the weather around me, and how it was developing, I judged this was the safest option.""
40In oral evidence, Mr Harrold said that he was aware as a matter of general knowledge of the existence of the SATA although he did not recollect flying close to it on any previous occasion.  He was aware that there was a process for a pilot who wished to fly over a restricted area which involved calling Air Traffic Control and seeking a clearance.  He agreed that on the morning of the flight, he had a full tank of petrol which should have provided him with three hours of flying time with half an hour reserve.  One hour of flying time had been used flying from Rosehill to Scone and approximately 30 minutes before the wire strike.  
41In oral evidence, Mr Harrold agreed that as he approached Broke there was cloud to the south and that it extended vertically as well as horizontally and that there was some cloud behind him (Black 143W, 144P).  At that time the helicopter was a couple of thousand feet above ground level.  He described the cloud to the south as ""pretty solid"" without any breaks in it.  When Mr Harrold decided to descend, he did not have a clear view of the land.  There was some cloud and some breaks in the cloud (Black 157L).
""Q.  From the point of commencement of the descent you had unimpeded view of land below you, didn't you?A.  I could see land and I flew through that gap in the cloud and descended the aircraft."" (Black 158N)
The descent brought the aircraft to approximately 500 feet above ground level.
42Mr Harrold's evidence was that he kept the range of hills on his right.  He accepted that the high point of Mount Broken Back (Trig 1943) was to his right because he could not see it.  It was obscured by cloud.  He said:
""A.  Well quite a bit of the range was obscured by cloud and I assumed that that part of the range was as well."" (Black 164S)
43In relation to whether that placed him in restricted airspace he said:
""Q.  You knew you were in restricted airspace, didn't you?A.  I knew there was a chance, a good chance of being there, yes, at that stage of the flight.  I was there for a good reason.  I was avoiding the cloud."" (Black 165K)
""A.  I was aware that there was a chance that I could be in restricted airspace, or be on the boundary anyway.  And then as I, as you quite rightly say, as I progressed further as a result of having to maintain VFO or not flying IMC, I deferred slightly to the north of the range."" (Black 166L)
44It was put to Mr Harrold that from the moment that he turned east near Broke he knew that he would be flying over restricted airspace.  Mr Harrold denied that proposition:
""A.  No, because I couldn't, as I turned just   I don't know if you can make that out on the map   but I turned sort of to the southeast of what I consider Broke because I went into that little valley and then I remember turning to the   turning the aircraft and tracking along the contour.  Which then, at that stage I thought I might quite possibly be able to get over the range and stay outside the restricted airspace.  But as I tracked further to the east, it became evident to me that I couldn't - I wouldn't take that option because of the visibility and the cloud and I did track slightly to the north of the range which most likely put me just inside the restricted airspace, okay, which I was aware of, but it was the highest and clearest point through to the east.""  (Black 167L - P)
""Q.  At this stage you were navigating by reference to the mountain range to your right, and the high voltage powerlines to your left, is that right?A.  More or less, yeah, yep.
Q.  What do you mean more or less?A.  Well they were the dominant sort of features I could see or I would have the best chance of seeing.
Q.  You could see them couldn't you?A.  I could see the range and I could see elements of the easement down to the north of me, at my left hand side.
Q.  The fact is you had a clear view out to the left didn't you?A.  Absolutely not.  I did not have a clear view, didn't have a clear view it was still cloud.
Q.  It was all above you wasn't it?A.  No.  No, there was cloud above me and there was cloud, mist, you know, to the north.
Q.  Cloud mist?A.  Yeah, well it was like --
Q.  What, you're a pilot, Mr Harrold, really.A.  Sorry.  There was low, there was some cloud to the north of the aircraft which was out the left hand side.
Q.  How far north?A.  It extended a fair way, I couldn't, I don't know I'm talking about a couple of miles I could see with that cloud in it here and there and I could make out the easement of the transmission line east/west.
Q.  So you say that the cloud to the north was a couple of miles away?A.  No, no, it was, it extended over the top of me, if anything it sort of moved, it sort of descended a little bit to the north."" (Black 173K - 174C)
""Q.  So what you saw, to the extent that it was below your altitude, what was to the north was mist?A.  Mist cloud, mist cloud, it was obscuring my unimpeded vision of the north, of the Dochra or restricted airspace.
Q.  You had also a view of the road that's on the VNC map at that point didn't you?A.  No, I didn't see the road.
Q.  Didn't see any road?A.  No.
Q.  What is it that led you to fly as close as you did to the escarpment rather than say 500 metres to the north?A.  Because that would have meant I would have had to descend a bit further to the north and I was trying  --
Q.  Why?A.  Well because it's a cloud over the top of, it descended down to the north.  So I chose what I considered to be the safest route, which was maintaining my altitude and remaining clear of cloud."" (Black 174M-V)
""Q.  So you knew what you needed to be concerned about was the top of the range to your right?A.  Yes, but then if I, if I flew any further out to the north then that would have lowered my altitude so it would have been an issue then with the distance above the ground.
Q.  Yes, but I put it to you that you knew that you were actually at a negative altitude when measured by reference to 300 metres - to the highest point within 300 metres and if you had gone north you'd have been necessarily at a positive altitude?A.  I couldn't go north because I would have gone into cloud.
Q.  Well you've just told us that the land was dropping away steeply to your left?A.  Yeah.
Q.  So it was an option to go to the left, wasn't it?A.  No, because I'm trying to explain to you the cloud lowered as it went to the north.
Q.  Yes, it didn't lower down to the ground, did it?A.  It seemed to further - well further north it did.
Q.  Yes, more than 2 miles to the north.  You saw this cloud for 2 miles to the north, didn't you?A.  It gradually went down, that's right, and gradually descended to the north so any track of mine to the north would have put me lower, under the cloud, further into the restricted area, right, and possibly down lower to the ground below me."" (Black 175X - 176M)
45By reference to par [158] of his first statement, the following questions were put to Mr Harrold:
""Q.  Did you see the cloud steeply bank down to join the ground about 2 nautical miles north of the edge of the range?A.  I saw the cloud, yes, basically descending further to the north.  I was looking past that, underneath that to the east.
Q.  Right.A.  Yep and as I said it was brighter.  When you get, you get a sense you can see brighter areas and darker areas and that's what I could see.
Q.  You see when you wrote 158 you did not have in your mind's eye that there was any bank of cloud descending down to meet the ground 2 nautical north did you?A.  I know I saw what I saw.
Q.  And you didn't see that did you?A.   Yes I did.
Q.  That's a lie, isn't it?A.  No it certainly is not a lie.""  (Black 182N-V)
""Q.  You had a clear view of the mountain range and the cloud above it didn't you?A.  When I say clear view, it wasn't like a completely unobstructed view but it was a, I clearly knew that was the range to south, that's what I meant by.
Q.  That's what you meant when you said that you had a clear view of the mountain range and the cloud?A.  Yes, well I wasn't going to run into the mountain range so I could see the mountain range.
Q.  Yes, so you could see clearly from your point where you'd completed the descent through to the mountain range?A.  Yes, with some, with cloud and other, yeah, I could, not level, there was some cloud but I could still see the vegetation or the dark mountain range outside the picture.
Q.  You could see land between the mountain range and your position, couldn't you?A.  No.  Sorry, land, can you explain?
Q.  Yes, you could see terrain that lay between your position south to the mountain range couldn't you?A.  It was, there was fog and mist on the lower part of the, below me to the north, sorry, to the south and I recall seeing the terrain lifting to the south, that's what I recall seeing, yes."" (Black 184F-Q)
""Q.  You proceeded to the point where you turned left.  At the point you turned left, had you considered landing?A.  I had.  I considered a couple of options.  I considered landing and going back on top of the cloud, and I didn't consider that to be safe to try to track back and go through the cloud and landing I considered also not to be a safe option given the other option I had which was to track along the range and maintain visibility with the range and fly to a more easterly direction where it was brighter and clearer or appeared brighter and clearer.
Q.  You did not, in considering landing, consider the option of tracking north under the cloud to a suitable landing spot, did you?A.  No, I didn't think that tracking north was going to provide me with any better landing spot given that the cloud base was as low as it was and visibility was poor.
Q.  But you were under the cloud base at all times?A.  I was under the initial cloud base, but there was cloud and mist at my level.
Q.  You were clear of cloud at all times?A.  I was clear of cloud, but then that cloud and my altitude, that that cloud does hamper my visibility looking forward, but I was clear of cloud.
Q.  Do you say you had less than 800 feet visibility looking forward?A.  800 metres?
Q.  Yes, less than 800 metres visibility looking forward?A.  I might have been confronted with the odd occasion where that might have been the case, but yes.
Q.  You didn't at any time seek a clearance to overfly a restricted area, did you?A.  No, I didn't.
Q.  You didn't ever consider seeking a clearance, did you?A.  At the time I was concerned about moving on from that area as best I could and I was just looking at the best option to get myself out of an area that was deteriorating, as far as I was concerned.  And that gave me the - you know, I tracked to the south to the range and I didn't consider asking for a clearance.  It could have taken some time to get one.  So, yeah, that's why I didn't consider it.
HIS HONOUR:
Q.  Given the sequence of events that would be required in obtaining a clearance, do you have any idea how long that would take?A.  Well it could take, it could take minutes, it could take 10 minutes, I don't know.  I've certainly had experiences where I've asked for a clearance in the past at other areas when it's taken 20 minutes to get a clearance.""  (Black 188Y-189W)
""Q.  At that point your earlier evidence was what you saw was a solid top to the cloud but underneath patches of cloud extending downwards to various heights, so that there were scattered clouds of a similar altitude to yours with some low lying patches of mist below around Broke.  That's what you said in that statement, there's no mention of cloud or fog around Broke is there?A.  That was, there was definitely cloud in Broke because I didn't see Broke but I think it's, sorry, it's a given when I said patches of mist and cloud, low line patches of mist below around Broke so I think adequately explained that there is mist or - I didn't use the word ""fog"" but there was certainly moisture obscuring my view."" (Black 191R-W)
""Q.  It's not the case, is it, that you saw any evidence of the weather closing in from west to east?A.  Look, yeah with the weather it was certainly closing in around me with it, it was moving from west to east is something that I couldn't be sure of, but it was certainly appeared to be closing.
...
HIS HONOUR:

Q.  What does closing mean?  Does it mean you're getting closer to the weather or the weather is getting closer to you?A.  I think it's becoming   yeah, the options are becoming less for me to, you know, fly to other - there's less options for me at the time where I was.  The weather is deteriorating I suppose is what I was - better --
Q.  Does it mean the closer you get to cloud the less options you have?A.  Yes.
Q.  Is that what you were meaning to convey or something else?A.  I was meaning to convey it was deteriorating around me, I suppose.""  (Black 192E-O)
""HIS HONOUR:
Q.  What is the process of declaring an emergency?  Do you declare an emergency as you land and just present it as fait accompli or do you still need permission?A.  I think you've got to be in imminent danger to declare it.  I think you can land.""  (Black 192U)
""COUNSEL:
Q.  So you've never referred to clouds being present to the north of your east track before today, and the reason you gave why you couldn't be flying north or your east track was the presence of the Army range, do you accept that?A.  Yes, it was one of the reasons, yes.
Q.  That was the only reason you had for not travelling to the north of where you were, wasn't it?A.  That's not right, but I should have paid more attention how I wrote this statement, but yeah.
Q.  You see you've attached to your second statement a map of the Army Training Area, haven't you?A.  Yeah, that was provided to me by my solicitors, yes.""  (Black 194R-V)
""Q.  You didn't at any point contour fly along the edge of the range, did you?A.  I did the whole time.
...
BRENNAN:  I'm sorry, contour flying is flying along terrain adjusting your altitude to keep an adequate separation between the aircraft and the terrain.
Q.  Is that correct?A.  Yeah, I flew beside the range and kept an altitude that was more or less the same throughout as best I could.  But I flew that contour.
Q.  So you say that you did not fly in a straight line, you flew along a path that reflected the contour of the range?A.  Yes.""  (Black 195P-W)
Resolution of factual issues
46The nature of the challenge to the findings of the trial judge as to weather conditions can be seen from the following extracts from the appeal transcript:
""One is that his Honour took the view that weather was closing in which forced him on.  It was a finding of a catchphrase that was never defined.  There was never evidence to suggest any speed at which cloud was moving or assembling or thickening.""  (AT 9.43)
""But clearly, at 1,370 feet above height datum, which is where he must have been, having regard to the intersection with the wire, he was well below that cloud and there was no suggestion of any cloud or weather immediately to the north of him - that is within a range of about 040 or 500 metres to the north of him - which would have stopped him from flying further out from the escarpment.  He was flying close to the escarpment for the reason given.""  (AT 11.36)
""His Honour's findings repeat over and over this expression ""weather closing in"" which, with the greatest respect to his Honour, is completely meaningless - never defined in anybody's evidence.  The only thing that was ever said about it when his Honour asked, ""What do you mean by closing in?"" was that he said, ""It was deteriorating around me.""  (AT 12.17)
""Quite so, but the other factor that it's important to is this supposed weather closing in.  When one reads the judgment, which I'll come to shortly, one would have the impression that this aircraft was scudding before a storm.  It is nothing like it.  His Honour never had any evidence to suggest that the rate of development of cloud, whether thickening through rising moisture or fog or change in temperature, inversion layers or the like, never had any evidence of what exactly the cloud was doing."" (AT 14.14)
47With great respect to senior counsel for the appellant, these submissions do not properly reflect the evidence.  Implicit in them is a requirement for a level of precision which would seldom, if ever, be found in any description of events leading up to an accident given by one of the protagonists.  While lawyers might wish for more detail, it needs to be kept in mind that what was being described was an evolving situation developing while the helicopter was travelling at approximately 150 kph.  In any event, there was ample evidence to support the trial judge's conclusions.
48There was the evidence of Mr Hodge at [30] of cloud moving in behind, from west to east.  
49In his statement of 17 February 2012 Mr Harrold said that he observed low cloud to the north and low cloud obscuring the high ground to the south.  The low cloud to the north extended westward.  He likened the appearance of the cloud to the profile of a mountain range turned upside down, i.e. a solid top to the cloud, but underneath patches of cloud extending downwards to various heights.
50In his oral evidence Mr Harrold made it clear that the cloud was sufficiently thick around Broke that he could not actually observe the town and although he was aware of the location of the high point of Mount Broken Back, he could not observe it because of the cloud.  He was definite that he did not have a clear view to the north nor to the south because of cloud.  A matter which the cross-examiner did not appear to appreciate was that the cloud to which Mr Harrold referred was not separately located to the left and right (north and south) but was continuous and extended over the top of the helicopter.  Mr Harrold said:
""No, no, it was - it extended over the top of me, if anything it sort of moved, it sort of descended a little bit to the north.""  (Black 174C)
51The cloud was sufficiently thick that although he could see the powerline easement marked on the VNC map, he could not see the road.  Mr Harrold said:
""Well because it's cloud over the top of, it descended down to the north.  So it shows what I considered to be the safest route which was maintaining my altitude and remaining clear of cloud."" (Black 174V)
""I couldn't go north because I would have gone into cloud.""  (Black 176E)
52Important evidence is that given at Black 192 where Mr Harrold said:
""Look yeah with the weather it was certainly closing in around me with it, it was moving from west to east is something that I couldn't be sure of, but it was certainly appeared to be closing.
Q.  What does 'closing' mean?  Does it mean you're getting closer to the weather or the weather is getting closer to you?A.  I think it's becoming, yeah the options are becoming less for me to, you know, fly to other - there's less options for me at the time where I was.  The weather is deteriorating I suppose is what I was - better -
Q.  Does it mean the closer you get to cloud, the less options you have?A.  Yes.
Q.  Is that what you were meaning to convey or something else?A.  I was meaning to convey it was deteriorating around me I suppose.""
53There is a real immediacy about the expressions ""the weather was certainly closing in around me ... it was deteriorating around me"".  Those descriptions do not require further definition or close analysis.  By reference to the cloud, the mist, his altitude, the topography and the weather generally, Mr Harrold was describing a deteriorating situation.  Accordingly, the appellant's submission that there was no evidentiary basis for his Honour's findings at [23] hereof has not been made out.
54There were other factual findings by the trial judge which were challenged.  The appellant submitted that his Honour's finding at [127] (Red 64P) to the effect that at the time of the wire strike, the helicopter was approximately 500 feet above ground level, was not open.  By reference to the length of the overhead wires which were struck (1,060 metres) and the point at which the wire was broken (350 metres) the appellant calculated that the distance above ground level was approximately 365 feet at the point of strike.  While it was generally agreed that this height could not be determined with any precision, given the inevitable sag in the wire over such a distance, it was a reasonable approximation.  The respondent implicitly accepted that proposition in the appeal and noted that he had made a similar submission in the trial.  Accordingly, I accept that his Honour erred in that finding.  Ultimately, however, nothing turns on that issue.
55The appellant challenged his Honour's finding (at [109] Red 61E and [116] Red 62N) that fuel had become an issue for Mr Harrold and that this further justified his decision to fly east towards Cessnock.  The appellant submitted that by the time Mr Harrold reached Broke, he had been flying for about 40 minutes on the return journey so that he had plenty of fuel left, i.e., 1 hour and 20 minutes of fuel plus a half hour reserve (AT11.16).
56That submission is not made out.  Mr Harrold's evidence was that one of the risks which he had to take into account was that he would be caught above cloud level and if there was no break in the clouds through which he could descend, the aircraft could run out of fuel.  This was clearly a genuine concern because he spoke to Mr Hodge about it just before the aircraft reached Broke ([31] hereof, Black 206P, Blue 402X).
57The appellant submitted that his Honour's finding at [115] Red 62D-G to the effect that Mr Harrold correctly considered that it was unsafe to seek a landing place in the vicinity of Broke, was not open on the evidence.  This was because there was no evidence to justify the possibility of explosions due to mining activity taking place around the Broke area.  While the submission concerning the possibility of explosions is made out, it provides only a partial answer to his Honour's finding.
58The evidence of Mr Harrold was that he had not previously landed in the Broke area and was unfamiliar with it.  He was aware that mining was taking place in the area and that this of itself would render landing in an unfamiliar location potentially dangerous.  While that is an appropriate explanation by Mr Harrold, the real issue is not whether it was possible to land at Broke or nearby, or whether it was reasonable for Mr Harrold to have landed the helicopter at Broke.  It is whether in the circumstances it was reasonable for him to continue flying as he did.  Just because it may have been reasonable for him to have landed at Broke, does not preclude it also being reasonable for him to continue with the journey.  Captain Nest in his report said:
""Landing should be considered as a possible option for the helicopter pilot, but it is not always the first option if there are other ways to safely conduct the flight.""  (Blue 575T)
59The appellant submitted that his Honour's finding at [118] Red 62R, to the effect that turning back to Scone was not an acceptable option on account of clouds, was not open on the evidence.  This was because there was no evidence that there was a build up of clouds behind the aircraft.
60That submission is not made out.  Not only was there evidence from Mr Harrold and Mr Hodge to the effect that cloud was moving in behind the aircraft, but Mr Harrold consistently referred to cloud build up to the north.  He described weather moving west to east and closing in around the aircraft which was clearly a reference to clouds.  It follows, therefore, that there was ample evidence to the effect that turning back was not a viable option (see [52] hereof).
61The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in rejecting as an alternative that the pilot could have sought permission from the Army to fly across the SATA ([188] -[197], Red 78M-80P).  The basis for this submission was the appellant's primary position, i.e. that the evidence did not justify a finding that the weather and in particular the clouds were closing in about the aircraft (AT 30.36 - .44).  That primary submission by the appellant has been rejected.
62There are, however, other valid bases for rejecting the submission.  These are, in effect, set out by the trial judge in his reasons (at Red 78R - 80P).  The alternative of hovering and orbiting for perhaps up to 20 minutes, in circumstances where weather conditions were deteriorating, was clearly problematic.  This is particularly so when there was clear air to the east, the distance to Cessnock was comparatively short and it would only take a matter of minutes to achieve.  Perhaps the best explanation is that given by Mr Harrold himself:
""Q.  You didn't ever consider seeking a clearance did you?A.  At the time I was concerned about moving on from that area as best I could and I was just looking at the best option to get myself out of an area that was deteriorating, as far as I was concerned.  And that gave me the - you know I tracked to the south to the range and I didn't consider asking for a clearance.  It could have taken some time to get one.  So yeah, that's why I didn't consider it.""  (Black 189Q - S).
63The appellant submitted that his Honour's findings at [119] - [125], Red 62X-64K were erroneous because his Honour failed to have regard to the expert evidence on these issues.  The appellant submitted that both Captain Nest and Mr Townsend had concluded that Mr Harrold had made mistakes in his navigation, causing him to place himself in unauthorised airspace above the SATA.  The appellant submitted that Mr Harrold by trying to avoid the southern boundary of the SATA had been forced to fly over rising ground, close to the escarpment of Mount Broken Back.  The appellant submitted that in effect what Mr Harrold had done was to trap himself between the SATA boundary to the north and rising ground to the south.  The appellant submitted that this had forced Mr Harrold when heading east to fly too low in exactly a location where a wire might be strung.
64This submission needs to be assessed against the rejection of the appellant's primary factual submission and the acceptance that travelling east with the intention of skirting the southern edge of the SATA was forced on Mr Harrold by the extent of the cloud cover.  It also needs to be kept in mind, as Mr Nest pointed out, that the VNC apart from being a very small scale map did not show contours but only significant geographical markers such as roads, major powerlines and specified high points.  Unless one was familiar with the SATA and surrounding terrain (which Mr Harrold was not) its boundaries could not easily be determined from the air.  This was particularly so when the cloud concentration was such that although Mr Harrold could see the powerline easement, he could not see the road on the boundary of the SATA, i.e. he was unable to identify a key geographical feature.  It also needs to be kept in mind that the helicopter was at this time travelling at approximately 150 kph.  The time for decision making was short.  The fact that Mr Harrold flew into the southern edge of the SATA was not necessarily due to poor navigation, but the exigencies of the weather conditions and his inability to identify crucial geographical features due to those weather conditions (Blue 574F-P, 640D-G).
65In his statement of 17 February 2012 (Blue 589N-T), Mr Harrold explained his decision making:
""21 With the limitations of VNC 3 as to the boundaries of the restricted area, the cloud to the east being a reasonable height above ground, and no powerlines marked on VNC 3 other than the main transmission lines well to the north, my judgment was that the safest option in the circumstances was to hug the southern boundary of the restricted area and fly in this 500ft to 1,000ft clearance between the ground and the base of the cloud for a few kilometres until I reached Cessnock, or perhaps Newcastle where I could land safely if the weather was to deteriorate further.  By the time I made this decision, and commenced tracking east, I estimate I was about a couple of nautical miles south of Broke.
22. It is correct that to take this course involved a short distance of low flying, and the need to hug the boundary of the restricted area, but the visibility was clear and, in the circumstances of the weather around me and how it6 was developing, I judged that this was the safest option.""
66It is significant that at the time of the wire strike, Mr Harrold had almost cleared the range and was only minutes away from Cessnock.  The dangers which he identified of the weather closing in behind him and to the north and south had been largely overcome.  The wire strike occurred not because Mr Harrold had trapped himself between the range and the SATA but because a powerline was unmarked, not recorded on any map and located in a position where it could not have reasonably been anticipated by a pilot.  The powerline because of its position was described by Mr Townsend as an unusual one, i.e. ""this particular wire that was hit, in this instance, is one of the abnormal ones.  They do exist, obviously, and coming from the top of one obstacle to the ground is what creates this as slightly different from a normal wire environment"" (Black 286C).
67There was no suggestion in the evidence that absent the powerline, either the helicopter's position within SATA or its height above ground level of themselves would have caused damage to the helicopter or have interfered with its safe arrival in Cessnock or elsewhere.  The characterisation of those hazards as foreseeably contributing to the accident is very much based on hindsight.  Mr Townsend made the obvious comment that live rounds in a military live firing range were not going to be fired onto its boundary but in a more central location (Blue 642Y).
68The appellant submitted that his Honour's fact finding as to the reasonableness of Mr Harrold's decision making was erroneous because he had failed to have due regard to the opinion of the experts.  The appellant relied particularly upon the joint opinion of the experts (Blue 740) which was as follows:
""Question
From PT of descent of helo from Broke, is there evidence of a departure from the standard of care of a helo pilot of ordinary skill and competence?If yes, in what respects?If not, why not?
Yes, in terms of:
- Appreciation of position in respect of the restricted area was not to that expected of a pilot of ordinary skill and competence.
- The navigation techniques used were not that expected of ordinary skill and competence this has resulted in entry into R532.
- Under the favourable weather conditions in evidence, the pilot's actions were appropriate until the point of choosing to low fly somewhere prior to the wire strike.  This ignores the aspect of entry into R532.
- Under the unfavourable weather conditions in evidence, the pilot's actions were appropriate until the bottom of the descent.  The ground level cloud/fog/mist in evidence, and the visibility reported are indicative of conditions below that which were suitable for the safe conduct of flight.
- There are other aspects beyond the points in time discussed above, where appropriateness of actions are subject to some disagreement.""
69His Honour clearly had regard to that material since he set it out in his judgment ([145], Red 68Q-69H).  His Honour made the obvious point that Mr Harrold's duty was not to make the best decision in the circumstances but to act reasonably in his decision making having regard to the expertise to be expected of a competent helicopter pilot.  His Honour noted the strong element of hindsight in the opinion of the experts and the apparent failure by them to recognise the quickly changing circumstances and the dynamic nature of the decision making required of Mr Harrold.
70As his Honour appreciated, the persons in the best position to assess weather conditions and conditions generally were Mr Harrold and Mr Hodges.  Quite clearly the ""favourable weather conditions"" scenario in the joint opinion can be rejected.  Implicit in the ""unfavourable weather conditions"" scenario considered by the experts is an assumption that an emergency situation had developed.  That is not how I interpret the evidence.  While weather conditions due to increase in cloud were clearly deteriorating, there continued to remain a reasonably clear path to the east albeit interspersed with some low cloud.
71The criticism of Mr Harrold's navigation has already been addressed.  It failed to take into account the limited nature of the VNC, Mr Harrold's unfamiliarity with the SATA and this terrain, and that key geographical features (such as the road) were obscured by cloud.  Accordingly, not only did his Honour take into account the opinions in the joint report of the experts but he specifically dealt with those issues in his judgment.
72There is another difficulty which arises from the form of the experts' reports.  They were, of course, written by persons unfamiliar with the law and there is a significant element of hindsight in the approach which they adopted.  Too close a reliance upon their conclusions would incorporate that error into the judgment.  The correct approach is that stated by Hayne J in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; 223 CLR 422 at [126]:
""126 When a plaintiff sues for damages alleging personal injury has been caused by the defendant's negligence, the inquiry about breach of duty must attempt to identify the reasonable person's response to foresight of the risk of occurrence of the injury which the plaintiff suffered. That inquiry must attempt, after the event, to judge what the reasonable person would have done to avoid what is now known to have occurred. Although that judgment must be made after the event it must seek to identify what the response would have been by a person looking forward at the prospect of the risk of injury.""
73By contrast the approach by the experts is of the kind which has been consistently deprecated by the courts.  In Vozza v Tooth & Co Ltd [1964] HCA 29; 112 CLR 316 at 318 Windeyer J said:
""It may seem that, because an accident has happened and a workman has been injured, his employer is liable for damages if it can be shown that, by some means, the accident might have been avoided. That is not so.""
Similarly, in Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361 at [19] French CJ and Gummow J said:
""19 Two things must be said as to the formulation of a duty of care and its scope and content.  First, there is an inherent danger in an action in negligence to look first to the cause of damage and what could have been done to prevent that damage, and from there determine the relevant duty, its scope and content.""
74Another difficulty is that the experts approached the Civil Aviation Regulations (CAR) as though they constituted particulars of negligence in absolute terms and that any breach of a regulation would constitute a negligent act.
75That, of course, does not necessarily follow.  The correct approach is that explained by the High Court in Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Fox; Calliden Insurance Limited v Fox [2009] HCA 35; 240 CLR 1 at [49] where the Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Bell JJ) said:
""49 The obligation imposed on Leighton under the Regulation, while not founding an action for breach of statutory duty, is central to the Court of Appeal's conclusion that a common law duty existed. While it is true that obligations under statutory or other enactments have relevance to determining the existence and scope of a duty, it is necessary to exercise caution in translating the obligations imposed on employers, principal contractors and others under the OHS Act and the Regulation into a duty of care at common law. This is because, as Gummow J explained in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Dederer, ""whatever their scope, all duties of care are to be discharged by the exercise of reasonable care. They do not impose a more stringent or onerous burden.""
50 The Court of Appeal gave no consideration to whether Leighton had implemented a reasonable system for ensuring that workers coming onto the site were identified, were required to undergo site induction and were required to show evidence of completion of general and work activity based OHS induction training.  The parts of the critical passage which were emphasised in the above quotation indicate that the liability that was imposed on Leighton was special or strict - a duty to provide induction training.  ...""
The error identified by the High Court in Leighton Contractors v Fox was the expression of the duty in absolute terms as specified by the statute rather than having regard to concepts of reasonableness.   
76Once the factual basis for his Honour's finding that the weather was closing in and thereby reducing the options available to Mr Harrold is accepted, his analysis of breach of duty and causation is unexceptionable.  In that regard, I note that no challenge was made to his Honour's finding that CAR 140 and CAR 157 did not confer a private right of action on the plaintiff but that their object was the control and regulation of air traffic generally.  Those regulations relevantly provided:
""140 Prohibited, restricted and danger areas
(4) The pilot in command of an aircraft must not fly the aircraft over a prohibited area.
Penalty: 25 penalty units.
(5) The pilot in command of an aircraft must not fly the aircraft over a restricted area if the flight is not in accordance with conditions specified in the notice declaring the area to be a restricted area.
Penalty:  25 penalty units.
(6) If the pilot in command of an aircraft finds that the aircraft is over a prohibited area or a restricted area in contravention of sub-regulation (4) or (5), the pilot must:
(a) Immediately have the aircraft flown to a position where it is not over the area; and
(b) when the aircraft reaches a position where it is not over the area, report the circumstances to Air Traffic Control; and 
(c) land at such aerodrome as is designated by Air Traffic Control and, for that purpose, obey any instructions given by Air Traffic Control as to the movement of the aircraft.
Penalty:  25 penalty units.
(7) An offence against sub-regulation (4), (5) or (6) is an offence of strict liability.
157 Low Flying

(1) The pilot in command of an aircraft must not fly the aircraft over:
(a) Any city, town or populous area at a height lower than 1000 feet; or 
 (b) any other area at a height lower than 500 feet.
Penalty:  50 penalty units.
(2) An offence against sub-regulation (1) is an offence of strict liability.
(3) A height specified in sub-regulation (1) is the height above the highest point of the terrain, and any object on it, within a radius of: 
(a)   in the case of an aircraft other than a helicopter - 600 metres; or 
           (b)   in the case of a helicopter - 300 metres; 
from a point on the terrain vertically below the aircraft.
...
(4)    Sub-regulation (1) does not apply if: 
(a)   through stress of weather or any other unavoidable cause it is essential that a lower height be maintained ...""
77Section 30 of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth) provided:
""Weather etc to be a defence
(1) In any proceedings for an offence against this Act or the Regulations, it is a defence if the act or omission charged is established to have been due to extreme weather conditions or other unavoidable cause.
(2) Any defence established under sub-section (1) need only be established on the balance of probability.""
78To the extent that the appellant relied upon breaches of those Regulations as particulars of negligence they have to be read on that basis, i.e. not as involving strict liability as is specified in the terms of the Regulations but in the context of a claim in negligence (Para 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim, Red 3R).  The particulars of negligence should therefore be read as an obligation ""to exercise reasonable care so as to not fly the helicopter into restricted airspace"" and ""to exercise reasonable care so as not to fly the aircraft below a height of 500 feet above ground level"".  That, however, was not the approach followed at trial.
79At trial it was assumed that the respondent through Mr Harrold owed the appellant a duty of care but the duty and its content do not seem to have been articulated.  To the extent that it is necessary, I would state the duty of care in general terms as a duty to take reasonable care in flying the helicopter so as to avoid injury to its passengers and damage to the aircraft.
80As the parties appreciated, the question of breach was to be determined by reference to ss 5B and 5C CLA.  Those sections provide:
""5B    General principles
(1)   A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk of harm unless:
(a)   the risk was foreseeable (that is, it is a risk of which the person knew or ought to have known), and
(b)   the risk was not insignificant, and
(c)   in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the person's position would have taken those precautions.
(2)   In determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk of harm, the court is to consider the following (amongst other relevant things):
(a)   the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,
(b)   the likely seriousness of the harm,
(c)   the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,
(d)   the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.
5C    Other principles
In proceedings relating to liability for negligence:
(a)   the burden of taking precautions to avoid a risk of harm includes the burden of taking precautions to avoid similar risks of harm for which the person may be responsible, and
(b)   the fact that a risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way does not of itself give rise to or affect liability for the way in which the thing was done, and
(c)  the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk.""
81His Honour set out his analysis of breach of duty at [169] - [201] (Red 74J-82D).  If one were to be critical of his Honour it would be that he did not in terms define the relevant ""risk of harm"".  In applying s5B, it is important to accurately identify the relevant risk of harm since it will usually govern how the other considerations in s5B are to be applied.
82The importance of identifying the ""risk of harm"" was stressed in Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330.  In the Court of Appeal the majority characterised the risk to the plaintiff as ""serious spinal injury flowing from the act of diving off the bridge"".  This was a risk said to have been created by the erection of the bridge.  However, Gummow J noted that this characterisation of the risk obscured the true source of potential injury which was not the erection of the bridge or any characteristic of the bridge, but rather the possibility of impact upon jumping into the potentially shallow water arising from the shifting sands of the estuary ([60] - [62]).  This mis-characterisation of the risk led to two further errors.  First it incorrectly focused attention on the frequency of the antecedent conduct, namely jumping and diving, and not the probability of the risk occurring as a result of that conduct, namely impact in shallow water.  This prevented a proper evaluation of the probability of that risk occurring.  Second it resulted in a focus on the RTA's role in creating the bridge and overlooked the lack of control the RTA had over the events that gave rise to the risk properly identified, namely the plaintiff's voluntary action in diving and the natural variations in the depth of the estuary beneath the bridge.
83In accordance with that guidance, I would have assessed the ""risk of harm"" as the possibility of the helicopter coming in contact with an unmarked obstruction which was not recorded on any map and which was virtually invisible from the air.  The foreseeable risk of that occurring would be low.  Such an approach might well have ended the inquiry as to breach at that point.
84As it was, his Honour, at least implicitly, identified the risk of harm somewhat more widely, i.e. the possibility of the helicopter coming in contact with a structure, without the important qualification that such a structure was virtually invisible from the air.  Such an approach was generous to the appellant but even on that basis, his Honour asked and answered the questions posed by s5B adversely to the appellant.  The preceding analysis of the various challenges made by the appellant to his Honour's fact finding has covered the issues raised by s5B.  There is no need to repeat that analysis here.
85Subsection 5C(b) was important in this case, particularly when considering the expert evidence.  This was very much a case where the risk of harm could have been avoided by doing something in a different way, but that of itself is not indicative of negligence.
86Most particularly, when considering the risk of harm and the application of ss5B and 5C generally, the risk was not and could not be the possibility of being trapped between the SATA and the rising ground.  That was not the sort of risk which eventuated but it was the risk identified by the appellant which was said to be caused by both Mr Harrold flying into the SATA and flying at a height below 500 feet above ground level.
87Nothing was said in the judgment, or apparently at trial, about the issue of causation.  That, of course, is provided for by s5D CLA.  Relevantly, that provision states:
""(1) A determination that negligence caused particular harm comprises the following elements:
(a) That the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm (factual causation), and
(b) That it is appropriate for the scope of the negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability).
(2)   In determining in an exceptional case, in accordance with established principles, whether negligence that cannot be established as a necessary condition of the occurrence of harm should be accepted as establishing factual causation, the court is to consider (amongst other relevant things) whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be imposed on the negligent party.""
88What we are concerned with here is factual causation.  Guidance as to the application of s5D(1)(a) was provided by the High Court in Strong v Woolworths Ltd & Anor [2012] HCA5; 246 CLR 182 at [20] where the plurality said:
""20 Under the statute, factual causation requires proof that the defendant's negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the particular harm. A necessary condition is a condition that must be present for the occurrence of the harm. However, there may be more than one set of conditions necessary for the occurrence of particular harm and it follows that a defendant's negligent act or omission which is necessary to complete a set of conditions that are jointly sufficient to account for the occurrence of the harm will meet the test of factual causation within s 5D(1)(a).  In such a case, the defendant's conduct may be described as contributing to the occurrence of the harm.  ...""
89It seems to have been assumed at trial that flying into restricted airspace over the SATA (CAR 140) and flying below 500 feet above ground level (CAR 157) satisfied the ""factual causation"" requirement under s5D(1)(a).  Insofar as flying in restricted airspace is concerned, that assumption is somewhat problematic.
90It follows that by reference to general concepts of negligence, the requirements of s5B and 5C CLA were not established by the appellant.  This does not take into account the application of the regulations, not as sources of duty in themselves, but as particulars of negligence.
91His Honour dealt with that issue at [202] - [220] (Red 82F-85X).  By reference to the statement of principle in Leighton Contractors v Fox his Honour's approach to those particulars of negligence unduly favoured the appellant.  Although his Honour found that they did not give rise to independent statutory causes of action, but only operated as particulars of negligence, his Honour then treated those asserted negligent breaches of regulation, as if they operated strictly in accordance with their terms, i.e. imposed strict liability.  As was made clear in Leighton Contractors v Fox, the correct approach was to impose an obligation on Mr Harrold to act reasonably so as not to fly within restricted airspace and fly below a height of 500 feet above ground level. 
92Even applying the more stringent test, i.e. that CAR 140 and 157 applied strictly according to their terms, his Honour was satisfied that those regulations had not been breached.  That finding was available to his Honour for the reasons which he set out.
93As his Honour noted, CAR 140 and 157 had to be read in conjunction with s30 of the CA Act.  Section 30 created a specific defence in relation to each regulation if the breach were established to have been due to ""extreme weather conditions or other unavoidable cause"".  Moreover, CAR 157 provided its own defence, i.e. ""through stress of weather or any other unavoidable cause it is essential that a lower height be maintained"".
94Based on his findings as to the prevailing weather conditions, his Honour determined in the case of CAR 140, that even if they did not qualify as ""extreme weather conditions"" they did qualify as an ""other unavoidable cause"".  In the absence of any authority on the point, that interpretation was open to his Honour.  It is an interpretation which is in accord with the natural meaning of the words.   This is so because the incursion into the SATA occurred due to exigencies beyond the control of Mr Harrold.  To have flown outside the SATA would have meant flying into cloud which all experts agreed was extremely dangerous.
95If I am wrong in that conclusion, it does not alter the outcome of this appeal.  As is clear from the undisputed facts as to the occurrence of the accident, the incursion into the SATA did not cause the accident.  The fact that the helicopter was flying in restricted airspace was not an essential pre-condition to the accident.  The essential pre-condition was that the helicopter be travelling at a certain height so as to come in contact with the unmarked powerlines.  The presence of the powerlines within the SATA was incidental.
96Apart from CA s30, CAR 157 has its own defence as part of the regulation.  His Honour's findings as to weather conditions certainly appear to satisfy the requirement of ""stress of weather"".  The unanimous opinion of the experts was that it was extremely dangerous for a helicopter to fly into cloud and that in such circumstances, the average survival time was in the order of 37 seconds (Black 306W).  This would satisfy the test that it was ""essential that a lower height be maintained"", i.e. that Mr Harrold fly below the clouds even if this meant flying at a height of less than 500 feet above ground level.  
97No authorities were placed before this Court as to the meaning of these regulations. Ruhani v Director of Police (No 2) [2005] HCA 43; 222 CLR 580 which was said to be authority for the meaning of the phrase ""stress of weather"" was not in fact authority for that.  His Honour did refer to a broadly analogous Canadian case where the phrase ""stress of weather"" was used in a maritime context.  There the phrase was construed to mean ""a bona fide apprehension of jeopardy arising in the mind of a reasonably competent and skilful master possessing courage and firmness"" (The Ship ""May"" v R (1931) SCR 374 at 382).  That construction supports the approach followed by the trial judge.  
98It follows that even applying a higher test than that which the law required, i.e. the direct application of the regulations, Mr Harrold was not in breach in that he was able to make out the defence available under each regulation.  That being so, he certainly satisfied the test which should have been applied, i.e. that he act reasonably to comply with the regulations.
Contract
99In oral submissions in the appeal, the appellant accepted that there were two agreements in effect at the time of the accident - an agreement in which the aircraft was bailed by the appellant to the respondent and an ongoing management agreement under which the respondent would hangar the aircraft, maintain it, charter it out to people and be entitled to keep the rewards from chartering it out, subject to paying a certain amount to the appellant.  In relation to the latter, the appellant accepted that no concluded agreement had been entered into, although draft agreements had been exchanged by the parties.
100The appellant submitted that in the circumstances of this case, where the activity to be undertaken was heavily regulated by the CAR, and by well understood and detailed rules of flight, a term would be implied as a matter of business efficacy that the helicopter would be handled in a manner which complied with the regulations.  If that were so, the appellant submitted, a breach of regulation would constitute a breach of contract and to establish a breach of contract on that basis, would not depend upon proof of want of reasonable care, but on proof of breach.  
101The appellant supported that proposition by reference to what was said in Cheshire & Fifoot Law of Contract (8th edition) at 10.55:
""Where the contract has not been recorded in a document, they are replaced with a single criterion:  A term is implied if it is ""necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case"".  
The learned authors quoted Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15; 164 CLR 539 at 573, Breen v Williams [1996] HCA 57; 186 CLR 71 at 90 and 123 as authority for that proposition.  Specifically, the appellant submitted that it was not necessary for it to satisfy the detailed requirements set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Hastings Shire [1977]UKPCHCA 1; (1994)180 CLR 266 at 283.  No submissions to contrary effect were made by the respondent.
102The appellant otherwise relied upon its written submissions in relation to its claim for breach of contract.  This creates something of a problem in that the oral submissions on breach of contract were somewhat different to those in the written submissions.
103The oral submissions on breach of contract are adequately answered by the analysis of the trial judge at [202] - [220] (Red 82F - 85X) and the discussion at [91] - [98] hereof.
104The relevant written submissions are at AWS [24] - [59] (Orange 17U - 23C).  There were four implied terms there relied upon:
""(a) that the aircraft would be operated safely and so as to avoid collisions with powerlines;
(b) the pilots would exercise due care and skill in the performance of the flight;
(c) the aircraft would be operated in compliance with the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (Cth) and the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 (Cth) and the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 (Cth) (""the Civil Aviation Legislation"") and;
(d) the pilots would fly the aircraft in accordance with the Civil Aviation legislation."" (Orange 17U - 18D)
105""Implied"" term (a) could not be part of the agreement.  It is trite to observe that one could operate an aircraft safely and still collide with powerlines particularly if the powerlines were unmarked and invisible from the air.  
106Term (b) was properly implied but does no more than re-state the duty of care in the negligence claim.  Arguably it was the only term which could be implied into this agreement because it would pick up taking reasonable care to comply with the CAR.
107""Implied"" terms (c) and (d) (which are in effect the same) would not be implied into the agreement in the way in which they are set out.  As already discussed, the ""Civil Aviation Legislation"" itself allowed for occasions when the regulations did not have to be complied with, e.g. stress of weather or any other unavoidable cause rendering it essential that a height lower than 500 feet above ground level be maintained and a breach due to ""extreme weather conditions or other unavoidable cause"".
108The term which should have been implied into the agreement was that the respondent through its pilot would exercise reasonable care so as to comply with the ""Civil Aviation legislation"", i.e. a term which incorporated CAR 140 and 157 but was expressed in the same way as a particular of negligence based on those regulations.  In any event, for the reasons already set out, the appellant failed to establish breach of those implied terms, however expressed.
109That does not end the examination of contract issues.  In the written submissions on appeal, the appellant sought to rely on additional contractual terms not pleaded or relied upon at trial.  This can be seen in the AWS at [28] (Orange 18J - Q).  These terms raise indemnification provisions which were in the draft agreement which was being discussed by the parties at the time of the accident.  Had these terms been included in the pleadings and had argument been raised at trial in relation to them, the form of the contract could have become an issue with perhaps other terms being relied upon by the respondent.  In any event, an amendment to the pleadings was required and evidence would have been called by both sides on the issue.  It follows that the appellant should not be allowed to raise these new issues on appeal, when they were not raised at the trial (Zheng v Cai [2009] HCA 52; 239 CLR 446, Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33; 162 CLR 1 at 7-8, Water Board v Moustakis [1988] HCA 12; 180 CLR 491 at 497).
Proportionate liability - CLA Part 4
110This issue would only arise if liability were found against the respondent in tort.  This has not occurred.  In deference to the submissions which were made, however, I propose to indicate my opinion in relation to it.
111His Honour dealt with this matter at [236] - [256] (Red 89W-94C).  On the assumption that liability was found against the respondent, his Honour apportioned liability as to 80 percent against Air Services Australia and Energy Australia and 20 percent against the respondent.  In doing so, his Honour fell into error.  This is because the respondent on the first day of the trial had abandoned any apportionment claim against Air Services Australia.  Accordingly, the only question to be considered is whether any liability should be found against Energy Australia, the entity responsible for the erection and maintenance of the powerline and if so, in what amount.
112There was evidence before the Court to the effect that marker balls which could have been used to mark the powerline, cost $180 each.  Given that the powerline was 1100 metres in length, the cost of appropriate marking would have been less than $5000.  It was common ground that in 1994 a police helicopter, carrying out an air search for another aircraft, had struck this same powerline.  Its pilot confirmed the evidence of Mr Harrold that the powerline was impossible to see from the air.  It was also common ground that in March 1994 following that accident, the powerline was replaced in the same location without marker balls and that this was the powerline struck by Mr Harrold.  It was common ground that the powerline remained unmarked.
113It was also uncontroversial that the ""Australian Standard for Air Navigation - Cables and Their Supporting Structures - Mapping and Marking"" being AS 3891.1 of 1991 provided:
""5.1 Any section of cable, which has -
...
(b) A cable height in excess of 90m continuously for 50m above any ground not containing a road, railway or navigable waterway shall be marked with markers of alternating colours, one of which shall be white, while the other colour shall be chosen to achieve maximum contrast with the background.  Intervals between markers shall be as follows ...""
The relevant interval here would be between 35 and 40 metres.
114An affidavit of Mr Walton provided evidence that powerline marker balls in attention catching sizes and colours had been readily available since the 1980's and could be simply fitted to powerlines in one form or another.  The affidavit included evidence that these devices had been sold to Energy Australia in the period 2001 - 2008, including in Hunter Valley regions such as Muswellbrook, Wallsend and Telarah.
115His Honour found that in the circumstances Energy Australia owed a duty of care to helicopter pilots such as Mr Harrold and that breach of duty in accordance with the provisions of s5B CLA had occurred.  He found that had Energy Australia been sued it would have been found liable for some part of the damage caused to the helicopter.
116The appellant submitted that this finding by his Honour was wrong.  It based its submissions upon the decision of Sheather v Country Energy [2007] NSWCA 179; (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-901.  That was a case where an energy company had erected a powerline in a gap between some hills.  There was a road which ran through that gap which was used by pilots as a navigational aid.  It was common practice for pilots to fly helicopters and other aircraft through that gap.  Flying through the gap was particularly attractive because the ridge often accumulated low cloud and the gap was the lowest point at which a pilot might be able to fly through without entering cloud.
117The appellant distinguished the facts of that case from the facts here.  It submitted that in Sheather a duty of care was owed because of the circumstances of the location of the wire which was strung across a gap through which it was reasonably foreseeable aircraft would pass and where its pylons were hidden in bush on either side of the gap.  
118The appellant submitted that the situation here was very different. The powerline was located in restricted airspace.  Rather than there being any enticement for pilots to fly close to the powerline, they were not supposed to fly through it at all.  It submitted that even though military helicopters might have used that airspace, that class of pilot did not include Mr Harrold and in any event, it would be a simple matter to advise military pilots of the existence of the powerline.  The appellant submitted that in this case Energy Australia owed no duty to all civil aviators who might fly in this area, particularly where they were forbidden to do so.
119The issues in determining this question are whether it was reasonably foreseeable by Energy Australia that helicopters might come in contact with the powerline and if it were reasonably foreseeable, was Mr Harrold a member of a class of pilot who should have been in the contemplation of Energy Australia as reasonably likely to come in contact with the powerline.
120What is clear from Mr Tyler's evidence concerning the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area, is that it should have been reasonably foreseeable by Energy Australia that military aircraft, and in particular helicopters, would be flying within the SATA.  It should also have been reasonably foreseeable that such military aircraft, in particular helicopters, because of the very nature of their function would have been engaged in low flying activities.  There was no evidence at trial that Energy Australia had notified the Australian Defence Force (ADF) of the presence of the powerline and the fact that it was unmarked.
121Even if Energy Australia had notified the ADF to that effect, it would not have been an adequate response to the foreseeable risk of injury for a number of reasons.  The consequences of contact with an unmarked powerline could be severe and in many cases, would result in death.  The cost of alleviating this danger was modest.  Notifying the ADF in the way suggested assumed that such information would have been communicated to each pilot operating in the area and it makes no allowance for momentary inadvertence on the part of a pilot whose attention was otherwise focused.  
122Looking at the matter purely from a duty of care point of view, I do not see any compelling reason for why the class to whom the duty was owed should be restricted to military pilots.  As the incident of 1994 made clear, there were good reasons why non-military helicopters could be operating in this area.  The factual circumstances of this case provide another, i.e. weather conditions could be such as to compel a civilian helicopter to fly in this area.
123From the point of view of breach of duty, I see no reason why the ""risk of harm"" in s5B should be a risk restricted to military pilots, rather than a more general risk, i.e. a risk that a helicopter (no matter of what kind) might come in contact with the powerline.
124Taking those matters into account, I am satisfied that not only did Energy Australia owe a duty to pilots such as Mr Harrold but that the duty was breached in this case.
125Without going into details as to moral culpability and causal potency, and having regard generally to the principles in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 at 494, I would apportion liability as to 60 percent against Energy Australia.
Quantum
126His Honour dealt with this at [257] - [271] (Red 94F - 97F).
127The only issue between the parties is the assessment by the trial judge of the claim for diminution in value of the repaired helicopter and the claim for loss of profits.  The difference between the parties in relation to the claim for loss of profits is small.  The real matter in dispute is the claim for diminution in value of the repaired helicopter.  The trial judge assessed the diminution in value at $50,000.  The claim made by the appellant is somewhere between $400,000 and $600,000.
128The assessment made by his Honour is essentially unreliable because he confused the helicopter under consideration with another helicopter.  His Honour erroneously thought that the subject helicopter was older, had flown for considerably longer and had suffered serious damage in addition to the damage caused by this accident.  For that reason, the assessment by his Honour cannot be supported so that this Court has to decide for itself the amount of damages recoverable under this heading, had the appellant succeeded in the appeal.
129The trial judge had available to him two reports by experts of comparable experience.  Mr Blackburn prepared a report on behalf of the appellant and Mr McLean on behalf of the respondent.  Both experts listed facts about the helicopter which can be usefully set out.  The matters referred to by Mr Blackburn were:  the helicopter had had three previous owners, had flown for 120 hours, was manufactured in 2008, that this was its only accident but that the accident had caused substantial structural damage which cost approximately $AU550,000 to repair.
130Salient matters identified by Mr McLean were:  the helicopter had been comprehensively repaired with new replacement parts and had been certified as fit for use following the repair and had been in continual use ever since.  He noted that the helicopter had landed safely (no crash landing) with damage only to the blades, canopy and doors.  Most particularly, the helicopter had sustained no mechanical or engine damage in the accident.  He assessed the accident damage as ""moderate"".  The helicopter was purchased approximately one month prior to the accident for $US 1.35 million.
131It should be noted that the helicopter was placed in use on a commercial basis when the repairs were completed and has operated satisfactorily since.  The helicopter was not for sale at the time of trial.
132A significant difference between the experts is that Mr McLean had particular regard to the number of helicopters for sale in Australia and New Zealand, but also took into account those for sale in North America and overseas.  His inquiries revealed approximately 30 such helicopters for sale (in September 2011).  Mr Blackburn focused mainly on the United States and as of April 2011, he found there to be approximately 60 such helicopters for sale.
133I did not find the example provided by Mr Blackburn (at Blue 196 O - T) to be particularly helpful.  He explained how difficult it was to sell a helicopter of this model which had been left neglected in a hangar for a year and referred specifically to the concerns which potential purchasers had about ""neglect"" and ""unknown internal damage"".  The helicopter in this case did not suffer any mechanical damage and so is not realistically comparable.
134The real problem with resale is that identified by Mr McLean, i.e. a psychological one.  Once a proposed purchaser knew that an aircraft had suffered damage, that would inevitably affect the assessment placed on its value.  This is despite the fact that the aircraft was expertly repaired to the manufacturer's specifications.
135The assessments made by both experts are somewhat arbitrary and they do not set out their reasoning process in any detail.  Given the subjective nature of the exercise, to some extent that is understandable.  I did, however, find the assessment by Mr Blackburn of $US 595,000 as the diminished value of the aircraft to be almost totally unexplained.  The approach of Mr McLean seems to me to be more balanced.  This is particularly so when as at the date of trial, the helicopter had been successfully operating for a considerable period of time.  There is some force in the submission on behalf of the respondent to the effect that the longer the helicopter successfully operates, the less concern a potential purchaser is going to have concerning the diminution of value.  
136Doing the best I can, I would assess the diminution in value at 10 percent of the purchase price, i.e. $US 135,000.  While that is somewhat greater than the 7 percent assessment made by Mr McLean, it does have regard to what he identified as the psychological effect of the helicopter having been damaged.  In my opinion, it is a much more realistic assessment than that of Mr Blackburn.  This is particularly so when the data used by Mr Blackburn covered aircraft which varied in date of manufacture from 1998 to 2009.
137In relation to the reduction in profits, I agree with the appellant that the figure of $20,000 assessed by his Honour appears to be an estimate made without any reference to the factual material provided to him.  The figure claimed by the appellant of $67,968 as explained by senior counsel in the appeal, relied upon an interpretation of the actual earnings of the repaired helicopter which is unduly favourable to the appellant, given that the accident occurred on the first day of the helicopter's operation.  In my opinion, a greater allowance needs to be made for the inevitable slow start which would have occurred whether the operation of the helicopter occurred when planned or as eventuated, nine months later.  I would allow $55,000 for the loss of profits.
138These findings as to apportionment and damages are, however, academic.  For the reasons set out above, the attack on his Honour's factual findings, except in some peripheral areas, has not been made out.  It follows, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.  The appellant should pay the costs of the appeal.
139WARD JA:  I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the comprehensive reasons of Hoeben JA and agree that, for those reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

2763433,Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Northcote [2014] NSWCCA 26,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.

2GARLING J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with respect to sentences imposed upon the respondent, Brian Raymond Northcote, in the District Court at Sydney by Jeffreys DCJ on 17 September 2013.

3Mr Northcote had pleaded guilty to three offences. The first was an offence against s 184(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) of using his position as an executive and managing director of Compass Hotel Group Ltd dishonestly, with the intention of directly or indirectly gaining an advantage for himself, namely, payments of money to Yardhouse Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd (""YANZ"") trading as NovaPrime, a company in which he had an interest. The two other offences were of making a false and misleading statement in a document filed with the Australian Securities Investment Commission (ASIC). These offences were contrary to s 1308(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 

4Having taken the guilty plea to these three offences, Jeffreys DCJ imposed a total effective sentence of 2 years imprisonment, to be served by way of intensive correction in the community under s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

5The sentences imposed by the sentencing Judge, which could not exceed 2 years to comply with the threshold for an Intensive Correction Order (""ICO""), took the following form:

The Crown Appeal

6On 17 September 2013, the CDPP informed Mr Northcote that it intended to appeal. The Appeal was filed on 26 September 2013. The respondent was served with that Appeal on that day. On 5 December 2013, the CDPP filed an Amended Notice of Appeal containing two grounds, namely:

(a)Ground 1 - His Honour erred, when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, by failing adequately to take into account material considerations such as the amount of advantage obtained, the deliberate pre-meditated nature and duration of the offending, and the extent of the dishonesty involved, and by taking into account extraneous and irrelevant matters such as the absence of any evidence of detriment to the companies. 

(b)Ground 2 - The sentences are manifestly inadequate. 

Facts

7A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered on sentence. It will be sufficient for the purpose of this appeal to set out a narrative of the principal facts and events.

8Mr Northcote was the sole director and (with his wife) the ultimate owner of the company YANZ. YANZ traded under the name NovaPrime. It will be convenient to describe this corporate entity by its trading name, NovaPrime. 

9In November 2006, NovaPrime entered into an agreement with a West Australian hotel broker, Burgess Rawson (WA) Pty Ltd, which involved Burgess Rawson splitting with NovaPrime on a 50/50 basis, any sales commission obtained by Burgess Rawson for any successful hotel sale where the purchaser was introduced to the sale by NovaPrime. It will be convenient to refer to this agreement as the conjunction agreement.

10By the time Mr Northcote entered into the conjunction agreement, he had become convinced that a successful business venture could be undertaken which involved the acquisition of a number of hotels in the Perth area. By about May 2007, Burgess Rawson had identified approximately 16 hotels in Western Australia as possible purchases. Negotiations were commenced. 

11Mr Northcote needed to raise capital to purchase the targeted hotels. In October 2007, Compass Hotel Group Ltd (""Compass""), a public company, was incorporated. Mr Northcote was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Compass upon incorporation. 

12In order to raise sufficient capital to purchase the targeted hotels, Compass undertook an initial public offer (""IPO""). A prospectus was issued with respect to the IPO of Compass in November 2007. The offer opened on 29 November 2007 and closed two weeks later, fully subscribed. The IPO raised $123 M.

13Compass became part of the broadly described Compass Hotel Group, which consisted of it and a trust called the Compass Hotel Group Trust (""the Trust""). Wholly owned subsidiaries of Compass were used as vehicles to purchase each of the businesses associated with the target hotels in Western Australia. The Trust was the body used to purchase the freehold of the land associated with those hotels.

14By 16 November 2007, and prior to the IPO, Compass had made offers to purchase 12 hotels and a market attached to one of the hotels. Those offers had been accepted by the vendors. Prices had been agreed and the sales commissions had been negotiated between Mr Northcote on behalf of Compass, Burgess Rawson and the respective vendors. In some instances the vendors had refused to pay sales commission as it was they who had been initially approached to sell their properties. In such cases, Mr Northcote, in his role as managing director of Compass, agreed that the relevant wholly owned subsidiary company would pay the relevant commissions, which were added on to the purchase price. 

15Between November 2007 and January 2008, Mr Northcote, as managing director and chief executive officer of Compass, had signed or authorised a number of documents to effect the purchase of the 13 businesses and associated freehold properties in Western Australia. The settlement for all purchases was completed in the early part of 2008, mostly in January and February, the last on 16 April 2008. 

16Between 17 and 21 January 2008, Burgess Rawson sent invoices to Compass and the hotel vendors with respect to the commissions payable for the purchase of the relevant hotels and businesses in Western Australia. The total of the commissions due from these sources was $3,271,248. 

17Pursuant to the conjunction agreement, NovaPrime was to receive 50 per cent of this sum, being $1,635,624.

18Between 5 February 2008 and 21 April 2008, in accordance with the conjunction agreement, NovaPrime received five payments from Burgess Rawson totalling $1,566,730.

19Thereafter, Mr Northcote arranged for the transfer of $1,091,984.19 from NovaPrime to bank accounts of other companies which he owned. 

20From the initial stages of formation of Compass, up until NovaPrime received the last payment from Burgess Rawson in April 2008, there were a number of occasions when Mr Northcote, in his capacity as the managing director of Compass, ought to have, but did not, disclose to Compass or its board of directors or its shareholders, the fact that he had an interest in NovaPrime and that NovaPrime would be receiving 50 per cent of the commissions arising from the purchase of the West Australian hotels by Compass. 

21Mr Northcote was a member of the Due Diligence Committee of Compass formed for the purpose of the IPO. That Committee met on 10 occasions during the period from 24 September to 23 November 2007. At each Due Diligence Committee meeting, an agenda item required those attending to declare any conflicts of interest. At no time during any of those meetings did Mr Northcote declare either his interest in NovaPrime or the existence of the conjunction agreement between NovaPrime and Burgess Rawson to share sales commissions. 

22During the initial stages of formation of Compass, Mr Northcote recommended Burgess Rawson as the appropriate agent to facilitate the purchase of hotels by Compass in Western Australia. In making that recommendation he ought to have, but did not, disclose to Compass and its board of directors, his interest in NovaPrime or the fact that by reason of the conjunction agreement, it would receive 50 per cent of the commissions.

23When the prospectus was issued with respect to the IPO for Compass, Mr Northcote, together with the other directors, signed a ""Management Sign Off Certificate"" as part of the due diligence process associated with the IPO. In doing so, each director, including Mr Northcote, certified that amongst other things, nothing had come to their attention which to the best of their knowledge or belief would cause them to believe that there was any material omission from the prospectus for the IPO. This was another instance where Mr Northcote was under a positive obligation to declare his interest in NovaPrime but failed so to do.

24Between 6 December 2007 and 12 August 2008, there were 10 meetings of the Compass board of directors. At each of those meetings, the Chair of Compass, Mr Warwick Jones, asked whether any director, including Mr Northcote, had any conflict of interest to declare. Mr Northcote did not ever mention, let alone declare his interest in NovaPrime, and the monies which NovaPrime was receiving from Burgess Rawson. 

25During that period, there were also two meetings of the Audit and Risk Management Committee of Compass. Mr Northcote attended the meetings of that Committee by invitation. The issue of conflict of interest was raised as the first item on the agenda of each meeting. At no time did Mr Northcote declare any conflict of interest including his ownership of NovaPrime and the conjunction agreement.

26On 2 January 2008, documents were lodged with ASIC notifying a change of directorship of NovaPrime. The effect of this change was to remove Mr Northcote from his position as a director of NovaPrime. The relevant documents lodged with ASIC included a ""Circular Resolution of the Board of Directors"" and a ""Resignation of Director"", both of which falsely recorded a change of directorship at NovaPrime on 1 October 2007. Each document purported to be signed by, inter alia, Mr Northcote on 1 October 2007. In fact there was no such resolution or change of directorship on 1 October 2007, and the documents were not signed on that day.

27The backdated documents were lodged for the purpose of falsely indicating that Mr Northcote had ceased to be officially associated with NovaPrime as from 1 October 2007. This enabled Mr Northcote to assert falsely that, on and from 1 October 2007, there was no conflict of interest between his respective positions with Compass and NovaPrime. The signing and lodging of these two documents with ASIC on 2 January 2008 was the basis for the two charges against Mr Northcote under s 1308(2) of the Corporations Act.

28The failure of Mr Northcote to declare at any of the times to which reference has been made above, his interest in NovaPrime, and NovaPrime's receipt of 50 per cent of the sales commissions from Burgess Rawson formed the basis of the offence against s 184(2) of the Corporations Act. 

29The Chairman of Compass, as a result of his own investigations in June 2009, became aware of Mr Northcote's interests in NovaPrime and the payments that the company had received pursuant to the agreement with Burgess Rawson. Mr Northcote was stood down from his duties and directorship of Compass on 16 July 2009. 

30In September 2010, Mr Northcote participated in a voluntary interview with ASIC, but made no relevant admissions in response to the allegations put to him, that he had breached his director's duties by failing to disclose a conflict of interest. 

31On 4 September 2012, Court Attendance Notices were issued and served on Mr Northcote. He appeared in the Local Court on the first occasion on 25 September 2012. 

32On 11 December 2012, he entered pleas of guilty to all three charges and was committed on that date to the District Court for sentence. 

District Court Sentence Proceedings

33The proceedings were stood over to 17 May 2013 before Jeffreys DCJ. On that day the CDPP tendered a bundle containing the Agreed Facts and other documents relevant to sentencing.

34Mr Northcote gave evidence, both by way of an affidavit and orally, and a number of affidavits, essentially attesting to his previous good character, were read. 

35In his evidence in chief, Mr Northcote agreed with the Statement of Agreed Facts. In cross-examination he agreed that his conduct relevant to the charge involved more than simply not disclosing his relationship with Burgess Rawson. He agreed that, when he held the position of Managing Director of Compass, he knew he was going to personally profit from every hotel that was purchased by Compass through Burgess Rawson and knew that that was a matter which should have been disclosed by him. He agreed that he made a conscious decision not to disclose that matter at any of the Due Diligence Committee meetings, or the Board meetings. 

36He also agreed that in the period from October 2007 onwards, he was involved in making a number of decisions and taking many actions relating to the purchase of hotels in Western Australia by Compass, and that on each such occasion he knew that he stood to personally gain from such decisions or the steps which he took.

37He was cross-examined with respect to the documents which were lodged with ASIC. He agreed that it would be accurate to describe his steps in lodging those false documents with ASIC as ""... being attempts to conceal [his] activities rather than rectifying them"".

38At the end of Mr Northcote's evidence, the CDPP and counsel for Mr Northcote put submissions to the Court both in written form and orally. 

39Counsel for Mr Northcote in his written submissions, submitted that a sentence involving imprisonment was appropriate but that in Mr Northcote's case, that sentence ought be served by way of an ICO. 

40He submitted that an ICO was appropriate because:

(a)an ICO remained available for white collar offences;

(b)the offences, whilst serious, did not create a risk of significant loss for the Compass Group, or the investing public, or any material deception of the market;

(c)the subjective factors, including his contrition and remorse, early pleas, otherwise being of good character, the punishment he had already suffered and the absence of a need for personal deterrence.

41The CDPP submitted both orally and in writing that it would not be appropriate for any term of imprisonment to be served by an ICO. The CDPP submitted to the sentencing Judge that the imposition of an ICO would amount to appellable error in the context of the case because:

""Such an order would not meet the requirements recently restated by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal for a sentence, particularly in market matters, to punish the offender, denounce his conduct and provide sufficient disincentive to others who may be tempted to offend.""

That submission was immediately followed by a reference to R v Pogson, R v Lapham and R v Martin [2012] NSWCCA 225 at [143]-[144]. 

42The CDPP provided to the sentencing Judge a schedule of relevant decisions in broadly similar circumstances. He then submitted this:

""In the case of serious criminal conduct by a company director, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, such as the provision of assistance and offer of future assistance: R v Howard [2003] NSWSC 1248 and R v Kamha [2008] NSWSC 765, a full time custodial sentence with a significant non-parole period is appropriate. There are no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify any lesser sentence.

No sentence other than a sentence involving imprisonment is appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. The nature and circumstance of the offences and the other s 16A Crimes Act matters addressed above, warrant the imposition of a sentence that involves a not insubstantial full time custodial period.""

43In the course of submissions, senior counsel appearing for the CDPP accepted that whilst there was separate and discrete criminality involved in misleading ASIC by the filing of the documents which were false in a material particular, that it would be an acceptable course for the sentencing Judge to impose sentences in respect of each of the three charges which were wholly concurrent. 

44At the end of the proceedings on 17 May 2013, the proceedings were stood over to 21 May 2013. In a relatively brief exchange on that next day, when the sentencing Judge asked for some further assistance to understand the facts of what occurred, the sentencing Judge said that he intended to refer Mr Northcote ""for an assessment for an intensive correction order in the community"".

45His Honour indicated that his view as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed was not at that stage a final one. Accordingly, to enable that assessment to take place, the sentencing proceedings were adjourned to 16 August 2013. 

46On that final occasion, some further clarification of the facts occurred, and the report of the assessment which was undertaken by a community corrections officer, and dated 13 August 2013, was tendered. That reported recorded that Mr Northcote had been assessed as suitable to perform community service work, and had been assessed as suitable for an ICO. 

47His Honour then proceeded to deliver his Remarks on Sentence and to impose the sentences. 

Mr Northcote's Subjective Circumstances

48Mr Northcote was born in April 1962. He was about 45 years old at the time of the offences, and 51 years old at the time of sentence. Mr Northcote had no prior criminal history.

49There was no suggestion that he suffered from any psychiatric or mental health condition or any physical ill health of any relevance.

50He gave evidence that he had been educated to Higher School Certificate Level in Sydney. He attended at the William Angliss College where he completed a Diploma of Hospitality Management and graduated in 1984. During that year he also undertook some further study at the Riverina Murray Institute of Higher Education at Wagga Wagga, in the area of wine science.

51He married at the age of 24. He is the father of three children. He had essentially spent his career in the hospitality and hotel industry. For 10 years prior to becoming involved with Compass, he was the managing director and general manager of a hospitality consulting business which serviced hotels in NSW. 

52In January 2012, Mr Northcote and his wife separated after 26 years of marriage. They are now divorced. Mr Northcote stays in touch with two of his children. The third has had no communication with him since he separated from his wife.

53In his affidavit, he expressed his remorse and regret for the circumstances leading up to his being charged. He accepted that it was his duty to ensure that he made adequate and frank disclosure and that he had not done so. He reported that he had been the subject of adverse publicity and industry gossip within the hotel and hospitality industry.

54He concluded his affidavit with this paragraph:

""I pleaded guilty at the first occasion given my deep regret and resolve never to again find myself in such difficult circumstances and to try to re-establish the respect of my family and the community. It may be a long road, but it is one that I am committed to achieve.""

Remarks on Sentence

55The Remarks on Sentence commence with a short description of the charges including identifying the particulars of dishonesty with respect to the first charge of conduct contrary to s 184(2) of the Corporations Act. The sentencing Judge then noted the pleas of guilty which he found were motivated by a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and an indication of contrition. His Honour then noted the requirements of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), in particular, that he was obliged to impose a sentence that was of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances. 

56His Honour acknowledged his obligation to take account of general deterrence, which he noted was a particularly important consideration in relation to offences of the kind with which he was dealing. 

57His Honour then noted the decision of this Court in R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435 where Lee J said that in considering the gravity of offences such as those with which the sentencing Judge was dealing, the sums of money involved are a significant matter to be considered. 

58Lee J said:

""In considering the gravity of offences objectively as is required, the amounts of money involved are a significant matter for consideration. The amount of money involved in cases of premeditated planned deception and fraud, are of necessity an important factor in the question of determining the degree of criminality for they are an indication of the extent to which a prisoner is prepared to be dishonest and to flout the law and to advance whatever are his own purposes.""

59His Honour then turned to consider the facts as set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts. In particular, he noted that NovaPrime received $1.566 M and that the offender in fact received a little under $1.1 M.

60His Honour noted that the offender would be disqualified from managing a corporation for a period of five years, which he observed was a matter to be taken into account. 

61His Honour then went on to consider the facts surrounding the charging of commission by Burgess Rawson, the hotel broker. He noted that the commission charged of 2 per cent was the normal market rate which was paid either by the vendor hotels or else was included in the purchase price if paid by Compass. He also noted that on occasions when Compass was paying the commissions, the rate of 2 per cent was negotiated down to 1 per cent. He then went on to say this:

""It seems that Burgess Rawson would have been, in my view, entitled to commission in relation to the purchase of those various hotels. In the materials before me, it is difficult to establish what, if any, actual detriment was caused to Compass Hotel Group, and that is a matter that I take into account. 

...

It seems clear in my view, and the Crown accepted, that a broker such as Burgess Rawson would have needed to be employed at some stage, and if the vendors of the particular hotels had not agreed for the broker to charge them commission, then somebody would have had to pay the commission. The commission is not an inflated commission, it was a market commission. That, in my view, is an important consideration in this matter.""

62His Honour then went on to consider in unexceptionable terms the subjective case of Mr Northcote. His Honour noted that whilst Mr Northcote was a man of prior good character, such fact is of lesser significance for crimes of the kind with which he was dealing, namely ""white collar"" offences.

63His Honour found that Mr Northcote had shown ""deep contrition"" which was manifest in his early plea of guilty and by reference to the affidavits of various personal referees. As well, he noted that the probation officer had formed a similar view.

64His Honour moved to the discussion of a number of the authorities and reached this conclusion:

""Having regard to the seriousness of the present offence, the need to ensure adequate punishment, the need for general deterrence and taking into account all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that imprisonment is the appropriate sentence. I then need to consider what that sentence should be and how that sentence should be undertaken.""

65His Honour moved to consider the relevance of the subjective case of Mr Northcote. He found that Mr Northcote had excellent prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. 

66His Honour then considered the interaction between each of the three offences, and in particular noted a discussion which he had had in the course of submissions with senior counsel for the CDPP. He then said:

""Taking into account what was discussed on 17 May 2013, taking into account the fact that the provision to the regulator in relation to the false documents was effectively to either assist in the commission of the first offence or to cover it up, it is my view that it would be appropriate to take into account that activity when determining the sentence for the first offence, and then, bearing in mind that I have so taken it into account, that the sentences imposed in relation to the second and third offences be separate and discrete sentences, but wholly concurrent.""

67His Honour then expressed the view that having taken into account all of the circumstances, the appropriate sentence was one of two years imprisonment. His Honour then turned to consider how that sentence should be served and determined that it was appropriate for Mr Northcote to serve the sentence by way of ICO. 

68His Honour set out his reasons for so doing in a short passage in the following terms:

""My reasons for that are the commission of the offence in the way that I have found. I accept that the offender has shown deep contrition and I accept that the offender is unlikely to commit further offences and that his prospects of rehabilitation are very good.""

69His Honour then proceeded to sentence Mr Northcote and impose conditions on his ICO. Those conditions were of the standard kind which, amongst other things, required Mr Northcote to undertake a minimum of 32 hours community service work per month. 

Grounds of Appeal

70The Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) identified two separate grounds of appeal. The CDPP submitted that Ground 1 identified errors on the part of the sentencing Judge which served to explain the imposition of a sentence which it submitted was manifestly inadequate. Ground 2 was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

71In this Court, the parties proceeded upon the basis that although it was appropriate to consider the Grounds separately, there was a good deal of overlap between the Grounds.

Ground 1 - Errors in Sentencing Process

72This Ground raised a question as to whether the sentencing Judge erred when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, by:

(a)failing to adequately to take into account material considerations; and

(b)taking into account extraneous and irrelevant matters. 

73The CDPP submits that the sentencing Judge failed to adequately take into account material considerations such as the amount of the advantage obtained, the deliberate premeditated nature and duration of the offending, and the extent of the dishonesty involved.

74The provisions of s 16A of the Crimes Act, require a court to impose a sentence that is of ""a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". In addition, s 16A(2) lists a series of matters which a court must take into account in addition to any other matters to which the Court may have regard when passing sentence. Prime amongst these matters is, as the CDPP submitted, the objective seriousness of the offending. 

75It is clear that unless due regard is to paid to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, there can be no proper attention to the principle that there needs be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime: R v Geddes [1936] 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556 per Jordan CJ; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354.

76In Dodd, the Court consisting of Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J, said:

""... making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place.""

77It is also clear that the Court will be slow to interfere with the determination of a sentencing Judge concerning the objective gravity of an offence: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]-[47]. 

78I have earlier set out in [64] a passage from the Remarks of Sentencing where his Honour referred to the seriousness of the offence. That was the only reference to the seriousness of the offence. Such a reference does not, and cannot be seen to, amount to a proper assessment of the objective seriousness of each of the offences. 

79The principal offence involving Mr Northcote using his position as a director dishonestly to gain an advantage, was characterised by the following features:

(a)the extended period of time over which the offence had taken place, namely, between October 2007 and April 2008;

(b)the fact that the offences were premeditated and planned, which planning commenced in 2006 when the agreement with Burgess Rawson was first struck;

(c)the large number of occasions upon which Mr Northcote was obliged to, but did not, disclose the arrangement with Burgess Rawson as his director's duties obliged him to do;

(d)the significant number of transactions which were entered into to give effect to the arrangement to purchase hotels through Burgess Rawson as the hotel broker, which at each step of the way required disclosure of the conjunction agreement;

(e)the extensive nature of the dishonesty engaged in by Mr Northcote to conceal from those entitled to know, the arrangements which would result in him personally profiting from the hotel purchases; 

(f)the fact that he personally profited by a sum of almost $1.1 M, and the total involved in the arrangement was about $1.56 M; and

(g)as Mr Northcote agreed in his cross-examination, throughout the relevant period he knew that the arrangement with Burgess Rawson should have been disclosed, including the fact that he would personally profit from it, but made a conscious decision not to disclose it.

80Although Mr Northcote was charged with a single offence, because that offence included all of the conduct which involved the various acts of being in breach of his duty as a director, each act of which was accompanied by the dishonesty to which he pleaded guilty. This was objectively a very serious example of offending of the kind charged. 

81The learned sentencing Judge ought to have, but did not, make an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. Had he done so he ought to have assessed it as being at the higher end of the range of offending. 

82The CDPP submitted to the sentencing Judge, and to this Court, that the offences were deliberate and planned offences executed over a significant period of time. It submitted that:

""They involved the deliberate, premeditated and systematic abuse by the respondent of his position. He repeatedly failed to declare his interests in NovaPrime on occasions when he had a positive duty to do so. The respondent took active steps to conceal his dishonesty by arranging for false documents to be lodged with ASIC. As a result of his dishonesty, the respondent improperly obtained a benefit to himself and companies controlled by him in excess of $1.5 M. This was a gross breach of trust of not only the Board of Compass Hotel Group, but its shareholders and all those with whom he had dealings with respect to the purchase of the relevant properties.""

83This is a correct summary and an appropriate description of the objective seriousness of the offending. The sentencing Judge simply failed to accord to this serious instance of offending any proper assessment of it at all. He did not discuss it beyond simply recording the facts. He made no real assessment of the objective criminality of the offending. 

84He fell into error by failing to make any adequate assessment of this issue, and Ground 1 of the appeal, to this extent, must be upheld.

85The CDPP also submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account matters which were irrelevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence. The CDPP submitted that the two matters which were taken into account by the sentencing Judge, and which were irrelevant, were:

(a)the absence of any detriment to the Compass Hotel Group; and 

(b)the entitlement of Burgess Rawson to charge a market rate commission in any event.

86The CDPP submitted that these matters were irrelevant because they were both concerned with whether there was any detriment to Compass, whereas the charge which was preferred under s 184(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 was a charge that Mr Northcote used his position dishonestly, not to cause a detriment to the Compass Hotel Group, but rather to gain an advantage for himself. Accordingly, so the CDPP submitted, the question of detriment was irrelevant and the absence of detriment, if that was the correct finding, was not capable of mitigating the objective seriousness of the offences before the Court. 

87The senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentencing Judge was correct to take into account as a consideration when sentencing, the absence of detriment to the Compass Hotel Group. It was submitted that the absence of detriment was relevant both when considering the nature and circumstance of the offences, and also whether there was any injury or damage resulting from the offences, both of which are specifically identified in s 16A of the Crimes Act as matters to which the Court ought have regard. The respondent pointed to other cases in which the absence of a detriment was considered to be relevant. 

88In particular, the respondent pointed to the decision of this Court in Kwok v R [2007] NSWCCA 281; (2007) 64 ACSR 307. But Kwok was a very different case to this. Whilst it is true that in Kwok the charge related to Mr Kwok obtaining an advantage for himself, or others (being companies with which he was associated), there was never any question of any inappropriate gain of money by Mr Kwok, or of any real detriment to the company. As Howie J said, at [129], the only deprivation suffered by the company of which Mr Kwok was a director as a result of his conduct, was:

""It's ability to determine whether to embark upon the leases independently of any contribution to the negotiations or decision making by the appellant.""

89Here, had Compass known of the advantage which had been obtained by Mr Northcote, it would have been able to consider whether it called upon him to give an account of his profit, that is, $1.56 M, to the company of which he was a director, namely Compass. It was denied the opportunity so to do. As well, as has earlier been noted, Mr Northcote obtained a significant personal advantage. Neither of these elements were present in Kwok. 

90In the nature and circumstances of these offences, and having regard to the terms of the charge, the absence of any monetary detriment to Compass, which was the way in which the sentencing Judge considered the matter, was entirely irrelevant. 

91Similarly, the question of whether or not Burgess Rawson would or would not have been able to charge a market commission, and if so who would or would not have paid it, was similarly irrelevant. The simple point to be made with respect to that is this: whatever be the charge which Burgess Rawson in fact levied, whether it be 2 per cent or 1 per cent, assuming for a moment that those charges were an appropriate market rate, the fact was that Burgess Rawson was willing to halve the commission which they received by sharing it with Mr Northcote. Thus, the fact that Burgess Rawson were or were not entitled to charge a commission at market rate, was entirely irrelevant as a factor to be taken into account in the nature and circumstances of this offence. What was relevant was the receipt of the money by Mr Northcote, and his dishonest concealment of the conjunction agreement. 

92It follows that the sentencing Judge fell into error in the respects identified in Ground 1.

Ground 2 - Manifest Inadequacy

93The CDPP submits that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. The CDPP submitted that having regard to the objective seriousness of the offending, and the need to give a sentence which reflected an adequate general deterrence, that the sentences imposed, to be served by way of an ICO, were wholly inadequate and reflected an error.

94The CDPP submitted that authorities of this Court demonstrated that for a sentence involving offences of this kind, the real ""bite"" of general deterrence takes effect only if a custodial sentence is imposed: R v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 per Whealy J (at [51]); R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 per Howie J (at [32]); R v Donald [2013] NSWCCA 238 per Latham J (at [76]) [86]; R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at [274]-[277].

95The CDPP also pointed to the fact that, although an ICO has the capacity to operate as a form of punishment, it does involve a significant degree of leniency: Hinchliffe (at [278]). 

96The CDPP submitted that the previous good character of Mr Northcote ought to be given little weight, together with the sentencing Judge's findings that Mr Northcote had expressed deep contrition, was unlikely to re-offend and had very good prospects of rehabilitation. The CDPP pointed to the remarks of Charles JA in Director of Public Prosecutions v Bulfin [1998] 4 VR 114 at 131. 

97In short, the CDPP submitted that the imposition of the ICO in the circumstances here did not pay adequate attention to the serious nature of the offence, the necessary general deterrence and the need to appropriately punish the offender.

98Senior counsel for the respondent, Mr Northcote, submitted that the Court should conclude that an ICO, in the circumstances here, constituted a substantial punishment, and that the conditions imposed by the ICO meant that Mr Northcote was not living a carefree existence amongst the community because the ICO deprived him of his liberty in a real and not merely fictional sense: R v Pogson [2012] NSWCCA 225; (2012) 82 NSWLR 60 at [111] per McClellan CJ at CL and Johnson J.

99In short, senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the sentences imposed could not be described as manifestly inadequate such that this Court would intervene.

100It is clear that the exercise of sentencing is well recognised as involving different, and sometimes conflicting purposes: Veen v The Queen (No.2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476-477; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at 129 [20]; Pogson at [114].

101Section 16A of the Crimes Act calls attention to the need to ensure that a person is adequately punished for the offence, the nature and circumstances of the offence and the need for specific deterrence. As well, it requires attention to be paid to the prospect of rehabilitation of the person, the person's subjective circumstances, and the probable effect that any sentence would have on the person's family or dependents. These are all matters which are in tension. 

102However, as was said in Pogson at [143] by McClellan CJ at CL, and Johnson J:

""Sentencing courts have a responsibility to ensure that the sentence imposed punishes the offender, denounces their criminal conduct and provides sufficient disincentive to others who may be tempted to offend, to ensure that they refrain from criminal activity. Although some statements have been made suggesting that in relation to some offences, general deterrence may be controversial, this is not the case with respect to crimes involving the market or other forms of business dealings.""

103I would conclude that the CDPP has made good this ground of appeal. 

104The total effective sentence imposed of 2 years to be served by ICO was manifestly inadequate because it did not reflect the seriousness of the offence, the extent to which the respondent personally was financially advantaged by the offence, the need for general deterrence and the need to impose a sentence which both punished Mr Northcote and denounced his criminal conduct.

105This ground should be upheld.

Should the Appeal be Dismissed?

106Even though the CDPP has established error with respect to both grounds of appeal, this Court needs to consider whether, in the exercise of its residual discretion, the appeal nevertheless should be dismissed.

107The primary purpose of appeals by the Crown, or the CDPP, against sentence under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons. This Court has in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, a residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence even though it is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2].

108It has also long been recognised since The Queen v Tait [1979] 46 FLR 386, that a Crown appeal raises considerations which are different from an offender's appeal. 

109In Tait at 388-389, Brennan and Deane JJ said:

""A Crown appeal puts in jeopardy 'the vested interest that a man has to the freedom which is his, subject to the sentence of a primary tribunal' (per Isaacs J in Whitaker v The King). The freedom beyond the sentence imposed is, for the second time, in jeopardy on a Crown appeal against sentence. It was first in jeopardy before the sentence in Court.""

110Their Honours identified some instances of double jeopardy. They said that it would be unjust to a defendant to expose him to double jeopardy because of an error affecting his sentence if the Crown's presentation of the case was a cause of, or a contribution to, that error. Their Honours identified that it would be unjust to a defendant for a case on appeal to be made against him on a new basis that could have been successfully challenged at first instance. 

111In this Court the question of double jeopardy was considered in R v Tleige (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 19 November 1982, unreported). In that case, Street CJ said:

""In determining what the quantum of sentence should be we have, as not infrequently occurs in the case of Crown appeals, borne in mind that the respondent has been twice in jeopardy in the matter of sentence. It will be distressing in the extreme for him to suffer the sentence passed on him some time ago being increased. This leads us to determine a sentence which is more lenient than would properly be appropriate if the matter were coming forward for sentence for the first time.""

112Another element of the principle of double jeopardy is the constraint on the sentence which this Court imposes if it decides to intervene. That element of the principle is well established and can properly be described as being ""a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance"": R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562 per Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 per Spigelman CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing at [96]-[97].

113For State offences, some aspects of the double jeopardy principles have been removed by the provisions of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. However, that section has no effect in these proceedings because they are Commonwealth offences.

114Accordingly, this Court needs to consider whether in the exercise of its residual discretion, and having regard to the principle of double jeopardy, it is appropriate to intervene and, if it does, then it is necessary to impose a sentence which is somewhat less than would otherwise be the case.

115I am satisfied that the Court should not exercise its residual discretion not to intervene with the sentences that were passed. Putting it another way, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for this Court to intervene in the circumstances of this case. 

116The sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge does not pay any adequate attention to the seriousness of the offending, nor to the numerous decisions of this Court which identify the important role of general deterrence in sentencing offenders for offences of this kind. 

117In my opinion the sentences imposed are offensive to the administration of justice, and are so mercifully lenient that this Court must intervene.

Re-sentence

118But for the principles of double jeopardy to which earlier reference has been made and, as well, the express concession by senior counsel for the CDPP before the sentencing Judge that the sentences for the three offences should be wholly concurrent, on any re-sentencing, this Court would have been obliged to have accumulated the sentences so as to have encapsulated, in a total effective sentence, the overall criminality involved. After all, Mr Northcote engaged in the offences of providing a document to ASIC which was false in material particular in order to cover up his crime of failing to attend to his director's duties honestly. Unless the sentences were accumulated to a degree, then it would be difficult to see that they would, in an overall sense, capture the extent of his criminality. 

119However, in re-sentencing Mr Northcote, this Court paying due regard to the principles of double jeopardy, should sentence him on the basis that all sentences are concurrent, consistently with the concession made below, from which this Court was not invited to depart.

120The principal offence against s 184(2) of the Corporations Act, involves, as I have earlier said, a high level of seriousness of the objective criminality. Mr Northcote personally profited by over $1 M from a deliberate pre-meditated course of conduct which extended over a lengthy period of time during which, on many occasions, he was in breach of his director's duties. 

121His offending was at the higher end of the range for this offence. 

122Mr Northcote was a man of prior good character and there is no reason to think that the sentencing Judge was in error when he found that he was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Because the Court is re-sentencing Mr Northcote, it is appropriate to have regard to the additional material filed on appeal which demonstrates that since commencing his sentence on 27 September 2013, he has complied with all of the conditions imposed on the ICO. 

123He has undertaken his community service under the direction of the Department of Corrective Services by working at a shop of a well-known charity every Thursday from 8.45am to 5pm. He has continued in employment in a business which is involved in the hotel industry, and that continued involvement has necessitated disclosure of his circumstances to new clients.

124He shares custody of his 14 year old son with his former wife, and has access to his son every second weekend. He is financially supporting his son through an agreement for child support and by paying his school fees. He says that his former wife would experience significant difficulty in maintaining his son without financial support from him.

125As well, the store manager of the charity shop where Mr Northcote has been working, has described him as making an exceptional contribution to the operations of the store, and has described him as humble, self motivated, hard working and a good team member.

126It is proper to have regard to all of these matters and take them into account.

127However, in my opinion nothing less than a term of full-time imprisonment served in custody is appropriate to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offence, and a penalty of such a severity as is appropriate to the offence. I do not discount having proper and due regard to the strong subjective circumstances involving Mr Northcote, but like so many other white collar crime offenders, these have less importance than they might in other circumstances.

128It is appropriate that Mr Northcote serve out the balance of the 2 year term of imprisonment imposed originally by Jeffreys DCJ. Again, but for the principle of double jeopardy, I would have thought a longer period in custody was plainly appropriate. However, having due regard to that principle, it is appropriate to restrict the custodial part of the sentence of imprisonment to the maximum allowed by Jeffreys DCJ.

129I propose the following orders:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Quash the sentences with respect to each offence imposed in the District Court of NSW (Jeffreys DCJ) on 17 September 2013.

(3)In lieu thereof impose the following sentences:

(a)On the offence of ""Use Position as a Director Dishonestly"" contrary to s 184(2) Corporations Act 2001 the respondent Mr Bryan Northcote is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 27 September 2013 and expiring on 26 March 2017.

(b)On the first offence of ""Making a False and Misleading Statement in a Document lodged with ASIC"", contrary to s 138(2) Corporations Act 2001, the respondent Mr Bryan Northcote is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 1 year commencing on 27 September 2013 and expiring on 26 September 2014.

(c)On the second offence of ""Making a False and Misleading Statement in a Document lodged with ASIC"", contrary to s 138(2) Corporations Act 2001, the respondent Mr Bryan Northcote is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of 1 year commencing on 27 September 2013 and expiring on 26 September 2014.

(4)The Court directs that the respondent be released on 26 September 2015, being the expiration of 2 years of the sentence with respect to the offence contrary to s 184(2) of the Corporations Act 2001, upon a recognisance that he be of good behaviour during the balance of the term of that sentence and upon him giving security in the sum of $1,000 without surety.

130R S HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Garling J and with his Honour's reasons.

ADDENDUM TO Judgment

131THE COURT: On 14 March 2014, the Court delivered judgment on this Crown appeal. It allowed the appeal, quashed the sentences imposed in the District Court of NSW on 17 September 2013, and re-sentenced Mr Northcote.

132Having determined that the sentencing Court fell into error, the Court considered whether, in the exercise of its residual discretion, the appeal should nevertheless have been dismissed. It decided that it was not appropriate to exercise its residual discretion to dismiss the appeal.

133The judgment dealt with this issue between [108] and [117]. In particular at [113], reference was made to the question of whether s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 applied to the proceedings because the offences in question were Commonwealth offences. 

134The attention of the Court was not drawn during argument to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; (2012) 244 CLR 638 nor to the decisions of this Court in Khazaal v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 140 and R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 which include a reference to the application of Bui in NSW. 

135However, having regard to the conclusions expressed in [115]-[117] of the judgment, no different sentence would have been imposed in this case.

2763434,Mac v R [2014] NSWCCA 24,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: As explained in more detail by Hidden J, Mr Mac was prosecuted in the District Court for two offences contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and two offences contrary to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The first two grounds of appeal in respect of his convictions on those counts alleged failures on the part of the trial judge to order separate trials. The third ground complained of a misdirection to the jury in respect of a specific factual defence.

2The trial being an exercise of federal jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of this Court with respect to the appeal was conferred by s 68(1)(d) and s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The effect of those provisions is to pick up and apply relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That Act requires leave to appeal against conviction, except on a ground which ""involves a question of law alone"". Each of the grounds relied upon in the present case involved mixed questions of law and fact: accordingly, leave was required.

3The proper application of the principles enunciated in R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519; 137 A Crim R 345 warrants a grant of leave to appeal against the convictions. However, the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by Hidden J.

4I also agree with Hidden J that the challenge to the sentences does not warrant a grant of leave to appeal. Accordingly, I agree that leave should be refused to appeal against the sentences.

5HIDDEN J: The appellant, Tien Ly Mac, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment containing four counts. The first and second counts alleged Commonwealth offences under the Criminal Code 1995:

(1) Attempting to import a marketable quantity of heroin (ss 307.2(1), 11.1);

(2) Dealing with money that was the proceeds of crime (s 400.4).

The third and fourth counts alleged State offences under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, being the supply of large commercial quantities of heroin and methylamphetamine respectively.

6He was found guilty of all four counts, and was later sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. He appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.

7Put shortly, it was the Crown case that in October and November of 2010 the appellant was in the business of supplying drugs. The first count, attempting to import heroin, was founded upon evidence that in October 2010 he travelled to Vietnam, his country of origin, and returned to Sydney on 1 November. On 7 November a package arrived in Australia from Vietnam, addressed to his daughter, Cindy Mac, at a property at Punchbowl which he owned but where he did not live. Examination of the package by Customs officers found that it contained heroin.

8The appellant had his nephew check the property from time to time for mail. On 11 November 2010, an undercover police officer tried to deliver the package at the address but, as there was no one there, left a form directing that it be picked up from the Lakemba Mall Delivery Centre. On the next day, 12 November, the appellant attended that centre to take delivery of it, and he was arrested. 

9Also on 12 November police searched the appellant's home at Lakemba, the property at Punchbowl and another property in which he had an interest. Items of significance were found at all three properties, but for present purposes it is sufficient to refer to what was found at the Lakemba home and the Punchbowl premises. 

10In a safe in the appellant's bedroom $554,250 in cash was found. This was the subject of the second count, dealing with the proceeds of crime. In the same safe was found large quantities of heroin, the subject of the third count, and methylamphetamine, the subject of the fourth count, together with a set of scales. The scales had traces of methylamphetamine and cocaine on them. Also located in the home were a heat seal machine and a flour sifter, which had on them traces of cocaine, methylamphetamine or both. In addition, there were found a box containing a number of plastic bags of one kind or another, another set of scales, an electronic money counter, a quantity of rubber bands and a roll of wire ties. 

11At the Punchbowl premises police found a quantity of a drug known as dimethyl sulfone, which can be used to cut methylamphetamine. Upon analysis of the methylamphetamine seized from the Lakemba home, that drug was found to be mixed with it. 

12It was the Crown case that the drugs and other items that were found were indicia of a drug supplying enterprise, and that the money was the product of that enterprise. 

13The defence case, again put shortly, was that the appellant used drugs but was not a dealer. He was a heavy gambler and the money was the proceeds of that activity. He denied involvement in an importation of heroin. His case was that the trip to Vietnam had been for a legitimate purpose, and that he had gone to the delivery centre to pick up the package for his daughter, unaware that it had contained heroin. 

14As to the heroin and methylamphetamine found in his safe, he acknowledged that he was aware that the drugs were there but claimed that they were not his. It was his case that he had allowed an acquantance, one Dung (or Duong) to store them at his home until he, Dung, could find suitable premises in which to keep them. It was his case that, with Dung's permission, he had used some of both drugs. Otherwise, he was merely minding them for Dung. He explained the other items found in the home by reference either to his drug use or to other, lawful, purposes. 

15For the purposes of the appeal it is not necessary to examine the competing cases in any greater detail. 

16The conviction appeal was argued on three grounds. The first two relate to the trial judge's rejection of an application for separate trial of the counts. The third relates to a direction her Honour gave the jury about the defence case. 

Separate trials

17The first ground asserts that her Honour erred in refusing to order separate trials of each of the counts. The second, alternative, ground complains of her refusal to order the trial of the first count separately from the other three counts. These grounds can be dealt with together.

18In fact, the application before the trial judge was that each of counts 1 and 2 be tried alone, with counts 3 and 4 being tried together. Her Honour rejected the application, giving reasons published as a separate judgment. 

19In this court the Crown prosecutor took no point about the fact that the grounds of appeal do not reflect the application that had been made at the trial. It is, of course, appropriate to consider her Honour's reasons for refusing the application but, strictly speaking, the grounds do not address the question which falls for this court's consideration. What we must decide is whether, in the light of the conduct of the trial and the issues ventilated, the joint trial of the counts occasioned a miscarriage of justice. However, no point was taken about the terms of the grounds on that basis either, and I am content to consider the question of miscarriage on the basis of the submissions, written and oral, in the appeal. 

20The trial judge considered the application in the light of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Section 29(1)(c) permits the joint trial of two or more counts where the alleged offences ""form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character."" However, by s 21(2)(a), a trial court may order a separate trial of any count or counts in an indictment if ""an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment ... .""

21The Crown prosecutor at the trial argued for a joint trial of the counts on the basis that the evidence in relation to each count was admissible in relation to the others, although he did not rely upon it as tendency evidence. Her Honour noted that ""the essence of the Crown's submission"" was that ""the whole of the evidence is admissible to show the true nature of the business it alleges the accused was conducting, being a business involving sourcing drugs, including importing drugs, and selling drugs."" 

22Her Honour referred to the principles enunciated by the High Court in Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590, considered by this court in R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519, 137 A Crim R 345. She accepted the Crown prosecutor's submission, saying that she was ""persuaded that the evidence the Crown intends to tender in respect of each count has high probative value in respect of the other counts in the way the Crown has outlined, ... , which high probative value well outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused."" She added that directions to the jury as to the purpose of the evidence should prevent any prejudice or improper use of it. 

23Her Honour noted a submission by defence counsel that, if the counts were heard together, there was a risk that the appellant's defence in relation to one count may prejudice him in relation to the others. She found that risk difficult to assess, as counsel had not elaborated on what those defences would be. In this court the defences raised were the centrepiece of the argument on behalf of the appellant. 

24Neither counsel for the appellant nor for the Crown in this court had appeared at the trial. Counsel for the appellant, Mr Brassil, argued that the evidence in respect of each count did not have the probative value in respect of the others for which the Crown contended, and that the joint trial of the counts was gravely prejudicial to the appellant. He referred to the different defences raised to each of the counts, which I have set out above. These emerged from the evidence of the appellant, which was supported in part by the evidence of his ex-partner, Ms Le. Mr Brassil submitted that the joint trial would have ""left the jury with a great deal of scepticism"" about each of those defences. 

25His fallback position, expressed in ground 2, was that, while the money laundering and drug supply counts might have been linked in such a way as to warrant their trial together, the importation count should have been tried separately. He argued that evidence of the appellant's involvement in the supply of drugs did not have the requisite probative force in respect of the allegation of importation, just as evidence of his involvement in the importation did not have that probative force in respect of the allegation of his being a supplier. The broad assertion by the Crown that the four counts demonstrated the appellant's involvement in a drug supply business, he submitted, was not justified by the evidence. 

26Mr Brassil also submitted that to allow the evidence of the counts to be used in that way was effectively to introduce tendency evidence, even though the Crown had not presented it as such. That being so, he argued, it should have been submitted to the test of significant probative value under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 and to the assessment of its probative value against its prejudicial effect required by s 101(2). That was not done and, his argument continued, the evidence may well have been found to be inadmissible if it had been. 

27The foundation of the joint trial of the counts was the cross-admissibility of the evidence of one in proof of the others. In Sutton v The Queen (1983-4) 152 CLR 528, a case concerned with multiple counts of sexual assault, Brennan J said (at 542-3):

""Usually, there is no risk of impermissible prejudice arising from the conduct of a single trial upon an indictment containing more than one count where the evidence relating to the accused's implication in an offence charged in one count is admissible in proof of his guilt of the offence or offences charged in the other count or counts. The admissibility of the evidence relating to one count upon a trial for another count is thus a question of importance affecting both the exercise of the discretion ... and, in the event of a trial on multiple counts, on the direction given to the jury relating to the way in which they may use the evidence tendered in proof of each count at the trial.""

28Of course, evidence relating to two or more counts may be cross-admissible on a basis other than tendency or coincidence. It is on this issue that the cases of Harriman and Quach are important. Neither case was concerned with the joint trial of counts, but each of them raised the question whether evidence of wrongdoing on the part of an accused other than that charged was admissible. Harriman involved a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin, while Quach was concerned with a charge of supplying heroin. In each case the accused was alleged to have committed the offence with an accomplice, and in each evidence of their prior dealing with heroin was held to be admissible to provide context to the conduct giving rise to the offence charged, so as to demonstrate its criminality.

29It is sufficient to refer to some passages from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Quach. In that case the evidence had not been relied upon as tendency evidence, and the Chief Justice had occasion to consider whether the admissibility of the evidence in Harriman involved tendency reasoning. His Honour concluded that it did not. 

30At [23] -[25] (351-2), his Honour said:

""[23] In Harriman the accused and his co-offender, Martin, had travelled to Thailand together. The co-offender had then travelled abroad and posted heroin to various addresses in Australia. Evidence was admitted of prior involvement between Harriman and Martin in the sale of heroin. 

[24] ... The reasoning in Harriman is consistent with the admissibility of evidence of prior heroin dealings on a basis other than tendency reasoning. In Harriman, it was admitted that there was in fact a meeting between Harriman and his co-offender Martin and the issue was to determine the events that occurred at that meeting. The same is true in this case, albeit the fact of the meeting is not admitted. 

[25] Brennan J identified the principle he would apply at 594 in a way which clearly distinguished between tendency reasoning and other uses: 

'However, where evidence does show more than the mere commission of another offence or predisposition to commit an offence and is otherwise probative of the offence charged or of a fact in issue, there is no rule of evidence which compels its exclusion. If, as a matter of human experience, the evidence tends to establish the offence charged or a fact in issue otherwise than by showing merely the commission of another offence or a propensity to commit an offence, the evidence is admissible. I would therefore respectfully agree with McHugh J that evidence of events which are part of the res gestae is admissible - and will usually be admitted - even if that evidence reveals the commission of an offence other than the offence charged.' [Emphasis added]

[26] With respect to the particular aspects of drug dealing in issue in the proceedings, his Honour concluded at 595-6: 

'Evidence of prior involvement by Harriman and Martin in the sale of heroin in association, evidence (from the witness Lisk) of prior sales of heroin by Harriman and evidence of Harriman's use of heroin were clearly prejudicial and were not admissible unless something more than the commission of prior offences was thereby revealed. In my opinion, more was revealed. The concatenation of these pieces of evidence showed that Harriman, prior to April 1987, had participated repeatedly in one role or another in heroin dealing in Western Australia. He had participated in a trade notorious for its clandestine organization, the creation of distribution networks of dealer-users, the payment of large sums of money enforced (if need be) by vicious measures, and the urgent demand by addicts for sources of supply. A person who is shown to have participated to a substantial degree in that trade - I am not speaking of mere use or of an isolated sale - is likely to have incentives to continue his participation in the trade and, because of the nature of the trade, is more likely to have done so than one who has not been a substantial participant. Evidence of substantial participation in the heroin trade can support an inference of continued participation although, of course, each case depends on its own facts. In determining whether or not evidence of participation can support such an inference regard must be had to the extent and duration of past participation, the proximity in time between the past participation and the offence charged and the whole of the circumstances of the case. In this case, the extent of Harriman's participation was such that, in the absence of anything to suggest that the participation by Harriman and Martin in the sale of heroin in Western Australia had been discontinued, the guilty inference might properly have been drawn.

Evidence of Harriman's participation in the heroin trade not only strengthened the Crown's allegation of motive; it tended to make it more likely that Harriman's relevant contacts with Martin - providing Martin with his (Harriman's) address in Bangkok and arranging to meet there, the visit to Chiang Mai, the furnishing of addresses in Western Australia - were for a guilty rather than an innocent purpose: see Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234. That evidence was highly probative of the offences charged. It was admissible, whether or not Harriman had raised in cross-examination the 'defence' that Martin was acting alone. There was no ground for excluding it in the exercise of a discretion.' [Emphasis added]""

31The Chief Justice went on to consider the judgments of the other members of the court in Harriman, finding their approach to be consistent with that of Brennan J. Turning to the facts of Quach itself, his Honour concluded that the evidence of prior dealings between the appellant and the accomplice was relevant to show that their contact on the occasion in question was, to adopt the phrase of Brennan J, ""for a guilty rather than an innocent purpose"": [28]. That approach is pertinent to the present case. At [44] (355-6), his Honour referred with approval to a passage, also pertinent to the present case, in a South Australian decision which did involve cross-admissibility of evidence between counts in an indictment: 

""[44] A similar issue arose in the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Ngo and Le [2002] SASC 373. In that case also there were a number of intercepted telephone calls in which a rudimentary code was used. It was submitted that evidence of the conversations which was relevant to the earlier counts could only have relevance to the later counts as propensity evidence. Besanko J, with whom Doyle CJ and Wicks J agreed, rejected this submission at [53]:

'In my opinion, there was a basis for the admission of the evidence other than a propensity basis. The prosecution was entitled to put forward evidence which as a whole showed the operation of a well organised and substantial business of buying and selling heroin. The jury was entitled to use the evidence of the telephone calls between April and August 1998 in assisting it in determining who was in possession of the heroin in the main bedroom and laundry of the house at 55 Addison Road on 17 August 1998 and in the various places at 39 Addison Road. Equally, the jury was entitled to use the evidence of the telephone calls as assisting it in determining who was in possession of the heroin at 55 Addison Road on 15 November 1997. Such a use of the evidence does not involve the jury reasoning on a propensity basis. The evidence, together with the evidence of the financial position of the appellants, was capable of establishing the fact that as at the time of the first recorded telephone call in April 1998 and for some time prior to that date there was a well-established and large-scale business in operation. In other words, the evidence was not put forward to support a conclusion that the appellant was a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offences. (R v Nieterink [1999] SASC 560; (1999) 76 SASR 56.)'""

32The submissions of the Crown prosecutor in this court that the evidence relating to the four counts was cross-admissible are persuasive. In relation to count 1, the attempted importation of heroin, the critical issue was whether the appellant was proved to have known that the package contained heroin or was reckless as to that matter. The appellant's case was that he had no knowledge of its contents. The Crown had to rely upon circumstantial evidence to establish the contrary. Plainly enough, evidence relating to the other three counts to the effect that he had large quantities of drugs in his possession for sale, together with a large sum of cash and various indicia of drug supply, was strongly probative on that question. It might be added that the quantities of heroin the subject of counts 1 and 3 were both found to be of South-East Asian origin, with similar purity levels. 

33Equally, the evidence relating to counts 1, 3 and 4, pointing to the appellant's involvement in the importation and supply of illicit drugs, was relevant and probative in respect of count 2, the money laundering count. Particularly was this so given the appellant's defence that it was the proceeds of gambling. Similarly, the evidence relating to counts 1 and 2 was important in considering the issue raised by counts 3 and 4, the supply of the heroin and methylamphetamine. Those counts relied upon the deeming provision to be found in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, and the appellant bore the burden of proving that he possessed them otherwise than for supply. His case, as I have said, was that he was minding them for another person (albeit with that person's permission to use some of them). 

34The appellant has no legitimate complaint if the joint trial of the counts had indeed left the jury ""with a great deal of scepticism"" about his defence to each of them. A realistic assessment of each defence would not have been possible without the evidence relating to the other counts. Justice would not have been done by separate trials of the counts, with each jury left to evaluate the defence case in ignorance of whole of the circumstances established by the evidence on the other counts. 

35Her Honour rightly found that the probative value of the evidence of each count in proof of the others well outweighed its prejudicial effect, and there was no basis upon which the use of the evidence in that way might have been prevented by s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

36In summing-up her Honour explained to the jury how the evidence could be used in the light of the Crown case that the appellant was conducting a business involving the importing and supplying of drugs, but warned against the impermissible use of it as mere propensity. When dealing with the use of evidence relating to counts 2, 3 and 4 in proof of count 1, she said:

""... you cannot take the evidence in support of the other counts into account in the sense of thinking, 'If the accused committed those other offences, therefore he must have been the kind of person who commits offences, and therefore he must have committed this offence charged in count 1.'""

Her Honour went on to explain that, in considering counts 2, 3 and 4, the jury could similarly take into account all the evidence in respect of the other counts, but added:

""But you cannot at any stage rely on the evidence relating to other counts to reason in the way that I have just said. You cannot reason, 'The accused must be a person who commits offences or a person who commits drug related offences and therefore he must have committed this offence we are considering now.'"" 

No objection was, or could have been, taken to those directions. 

37I am satisfied that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the joint trial of the four counts. Grounds 1 and 2 should be dismissed.

Defence case - counts 3 and 4

38Essentially, the appellant's answer to counts 3 and 4, the (deemed) supply of heroin and methylamphetamine, was a Carey defence: R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292, that is, that he was minding the drugs for Mr Dung and intended to return them to Mr Dung when he reclaimed them. However, as I have said, it was the appellant's case that Mr Dung had given him permission to use the drugs during that period. This ground complains of a passage in her Honour's summing-up. To evaluate the ground it is necessary to place that passage in its context in the summing-up and to refer to some earlier discussion between her Honour and counsel about the matter. 

39In the course of discussion about directions before counsel addressed the jury, there was consideration of how the defence to counts 3 and 4 should be put. The position of defence counsel was that the jury should be told that if they rejected the appellant's account that he was minding the drugs for Dung, they should still consider whether they were for his personal use, rather than for supply. Counsel argued that, given the evidence of the extent of the appellant's use of the drugs, it would be open to the jury to find that the whole of each drug was for his personal use. The Crown prosecutor's position was that it had never been the appellant's case that he had all the drugs for his personal use. He submitted that the jury should be instructed that if they rejected the appellant's evidence that he was minding the drugs for Dung, they should find him guilty even if they accepted that he intended to use some of them.

40The matter was the subject of extensive discussion, and her Honour ruled upon it on the following day. She accepted the Crown's submission, deciding that she would direct the jury that, if they did not accept that the appellant was minding the drugs for Dung, then it had never been his case that the whole of the amount of those drugs was for his personal use, and that ""therefore it would not be open to them to find he had discharged his onus on that basis alone.""

41Her Honour directed the jury accordingly. She referred to the appellant's evidence that Dung had left him the heroin and methylamphetamine to mind ""until he found a better flat on his own, and that with Dung's permission, he used some of the heroin and methylamphetamine for his own personal use."" Her Honour continued:

""In order for the accused to satisfy you that he had each of the drugs in his possession other than for supplying it, he would have to establish that on the balance of probabilities in relation to the whole of the quantity of the drugs in his possession, not just a part of the quantity of the drugs.

If you were to not accept the accused's evidence that Dung gave him the drugs to mind, it has not been the accused's case that the whole of the quantity of each drug was for his personal use.

So his case has been presented as having the two limbs, minding the drugs for Dung and using some for himself. It was not presented as two alternative explanations; they are interrelated in that way.

In order to discharge his onus of proving that each of the drugs was in his possession other than for supply, on the basis of personal use only, the accused would have to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the whole of the quantity of each drug was in his possession for personal use. But that has not been his case in this trial.""

It is that last paragraph which has been specified as the relevant misdirection in this ground of appeal. 

42A little later her Honour added:

""So, if you do not accept that the accused was minding the drugs for Dung, and you find that he was using part of the drugs only for his personal use, and not the whole of the drugs, which as I said, the evidence does not support, then you would have to find him guilty of counts 3 and 4.

If you accept Mr Mac's dual explanation, that he was minding the drugs for Dung and using some for his personal use, on the balance of probabilities, then you would find him not guilty of counts 3 and 4."" 

43As I understand Mr Brassil's submission on this ground, it is that the italicised passage from the summing-up may have misled the jury to believe that to acquit the appellant of counts 3 and 4 they would have to be satisfied that he had the whole of the drugs for his own use. That being so, what her Honour said in that passage would have conveyed that the defence could not succeed and that conviction was inevitable. In effect, as I understand it, the argument was that the jury might have been diverted from consideration of the Carey defence. 

44However, when the italicised passage is viewed in its context, that submission is untenable. Her Honour clearly conveyed to the jury the Carey defence and, equally clearly, the purpose of the directions about personal use were to explain to the jury what the position would be if they rejected that Carey defence. Presumably this is how defence counsel at the trial understood it because he made no complaint about those directions at the end of the summing-up.

45This ground is without substance and should also be dismissed.

Sentence

46The maximum sentences for the offences in the indictment are as follows:

1: Attempting to import heroin, 25 years imprisonment;

2: Dealing with the proceeds of crime, 20 years imprisonment;

3 & 4: Supply of the large commercial quantity of heroin and methylamphetamine, imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

47Her Honour sentenced the appellant as follows:

Count 1 - imprisonment for 9 years, count 2 - imprisonment for 8 years, both to commence on 23 October 2011. In respect of those sentences she fixed a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment.

Count 3 - imprisonment for 8 years, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 3 years, commencing on 23 October 2014.

Count 4 - imprisonment for 9 years, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years, commencing on 23 October 2015.

The sentences for counts 1 and 2 were backdated to allow for a discrete period of pre-trial custody. The aggregate sentence, as I have said, was imprisonment for 13 years with an effective non-parole period of 9 years.

48The challenge to the sentences is expressed briefly in Mr Brassil's written submissions. It is said that her Honour erred in her finding that no part of the money found in the appellant's safe was the proceeds of gambling, and in failing to take into account the time the appellant spent on bail subject to onerous conditions. It is also asserted that the aggregate sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. These submissions were not developed in writing. Nor were they in oral argument except to refer to submissions on sentence made to her Honour by counsel then appearing. 

49What emerges from the transcript of those submissions is that, on questions of fact, her Honour rejected some of the arguments put on behalf of the appellant. Mr Brassil did not expose any error in the manner in which her Honour dealt with those matters. 

50In particular, as to the money found in the safe, her Honour noted that the trial had not been conducted on the basis that some of the money was the proceeds of gambling and some of it was the proceeds of drug sales. She expressed herself to be satisfied that the jury's verdict ""entailed a rejection"" of the appellant's evidence that the money in the safe was the proceeds of gambling and ""an acceptance of the Crown case, that it was the proceeds of drug sales."" Given the issue at the trial about the source of the money, and having regard to the indicia of drug supply found at the home, her Honour expressed herself to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the whole of the money was the proceeds of drug dealing. No error in that process of reasoning was identified. 

51Her Honour did not refer at all to the appellant's conditions of bail, no doubt because the matter was not raised in submissions to her. I might add that, while there were a large number of bail conditions, including submission to electronic monitoring and restriction upon the appellant's movements, it is not apparent that they were so onerous as to have had any significant bearing on sentence. 

52The assertion that the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive was also not developed in argument, written or oral. Her Honour noted the appellant's generally favourable subjective case, being a mature man with no criminal history, the father of a number of children, and a person who had been involved in legitimate business enterprises and had commanded respect in his community. Nevertheless, her Honour rightly found the offences to have been serious and there is no basis upon which it could be said that the sentences, individually or in their cumulative effect, are excessive.

53I would refuse leave to appeal against sentence.

Orders

54Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed and that leave to appeal against sentence be refused.


55RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J and with his Honour's reasons.

2763441,R v Murphy [2014] NSWDC 382,"sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Henry Murphy appears today for sentence in relation to four offences to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and continued his pleas of guilty in this Court.
	
	
	All the offences were committed on the one day, that is in the early hours of 9 September 2013 and they were committed within a short period of time of one another. They were respectively offences of armed robbery with an offensive weapon committed upon Ximing Ilinj, Derrick Wong and Alcantara Castillo, and one offence of attempting to steal property from a motor vehicle. I will deal with the facts of the matters in a moment.
	
	
	The maximum penalties for the three armed robbery matters are in each case 20 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period. The maximum penalty for attempted larceny is seven years imprisonment.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on the morning of the offences and has been in custody since 9 September 2013. All time in custody will be taken into account.
	
	
	The prisoner was born, as I understand it, on 19 March 1994 and thus at the time of the commission of the offences was 19 years of age, about to turn 20 years of age on 19 March this year.
	
	
	The facts are that in the early hours of the morning the prisoner robbed the victims Ilinj and Wong as they were standing outside a building in the University of New South Wales having a cigarette during a break from studies and or research. The prisoner accosted the victims with a knife described as a ‘kitchen style’ knife. The prisoner pointed the knife at Mr Wong’s neck asking him for his wallet or else he would stab him and he waved the knife approximately 15 to 20 centimetres from Wong’s face. Wong took his wallet out of his back pocket and handed it to the prisoner. The prisoner also asked Ilinj for his wallet and also threated Ilinj with the knife in his possession. Ilinj removed his wallet, held it out to the prisoner and the prisoner took a $20 note that was sticking out of the top of the wallet. Mr Wong asked the prisoner if he could have his student card and the prisoner handed him back his wallet and Mr Wong removed his student card and handed the wallet back to the prisoner. As he walked away he called out “Don’t call the police”. He continued to walk around the university grounds in the meantime having disposed of the wallet and its contents, dropping them on the ground.
	
	
	About ten minutes later he approached a white Subaru Liberty station wagon parked in the university grounds in Science Road. The next victim, Mr Castillo, was seated in the front driver’s seat with the window wound down on his side. The prisoner held a knife towards Mr Castillo’s neck and said, “Give me your money or I’ll cut your fucking face”. The victim fearing for his safety and given the proximity of the knife to his skin reached into the centre console, grabbed a hand full of loose change handing it to the prisoner and the prisoner walked away. It would appear that the police were notified. Police spoke to Mr Castillo. He told them of the prisoner’s appearance. The prisoner was seen by police. He threw a knife in his possession, as well as a screwdriver and tried to walk away. The police gave chase, but he was arrested. The prisoner had, as it is particularised in the Court Attendance Notices, stolen from the victim Ilinj the sum of $20, Wong, the brown wallet and from Castillo $20 in loose change. The proceeds of this robbery were very small indeed, but of course the use of a weapon and the threat to the victims renders the crimes as serious ones obviously.
	
	
	The police recovered the cash on his person. They also found another item, a box cutter, in his pants pocket although there is no suggestion that the prisoner had threatened anybody or used the box cutter or the screw driver in his possession.
	
	
	The facts of the attempted larceny are intimately connected. The car in question which he broke into was secured in a car park. The prisoner smashed the passenger side window to the vehicle and rummaged through the contents of the car and found nothing of value. Police undertook various tests and took various samples from the scene and a DNA sample matching the DNA profile of the prisoner was located. Of course, the prisoner caused damage to the motor vehicle in his endeavour to obviously obtain a relatively small amount of benefit for himself.
	
	
	The prisoner when arrested by police told them that he had robbed people so he could get money to feed his daughter. The prisoner at the time of the commission of the offence was in a partnership with a young woman, although as I understood the history that he gave at least one person, they were not residing together at the relevant time. The prisoner has a child who is aged less than one year. He admitted his guilt to the police and clearly on the basis of the material available to the Court was co-operative with them in their investigations.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history is comprised of a number of offences committed whilst a juvenile or amenable to jurisdiction in the Children’s Court. However, his record does him no credit. It reflects in fact a very disturbing trend in antisocial and violent behaviour, which is very much a reflection of some of the other material that has been tendered on his behalf in explanation of his upbringing and the difficulties that have beset him since he was a child.
	
	
	He has findings of guilt in 2008 for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray for which he was placed on probation. He had a finding of guilt also in 2008 for common assault and robbery in company as well as having goods in custody suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained.
	
	
	He was granted various forms of probation but came back before the Children’s Court charged with aggravated breaking, entering and stealing in company for which he again was given probation in 2010. In the meantime, he received a community service order in respect of the matters for which he had previously been given probation concerning the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray. He had another charge dealt with at the same time, as best as I understand the record, but ultimately it is not entirely clear from the record given to me. He breached his probation and was ordered to serve community service for at least one of those damage property charges.
	
	
	He has other findings of guilt for resisting police in the execution of their duty and for those again he received various orders of probation and the like. He has a finding of guilt in relation to a police pursuit offence, not stopping it would seem and driving dangerously, which matter was dealt with in November 2010 for which he was sentenced to serve seven months in custody by way of a ‘control order’, but that was suspended pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. There was another offence also dealt with at the same time in the same way of taking and driving a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent. Finally, on 23 November 2010, he was dealt with in relation to using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention or apprehension and again he received seven months detention by way of ‘control order’ suspended pursuant to s 33(1)(b) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act.
	
	
	This criminal history not only does him no credit but it reflects upon the fact that over a period of time in a rather lenient way the offender has been dealt with in the Children’s Court by various mechanisms, probation, bonds, suspended sentences, community service, yet we find the offender committing the offences with which I am concerned.
	
	
	It must be fairly said in his favour, although it is only a relatively minor matter, that as I understand the criminal history there would appear to be a break of almost two years between the last of the offending dealt with in the Children’s Court and the commission of the offences committed in September 2013 with which I am concerned.
	
	
	In the defence case, I have a report from Mr Tim Watson-Munro a psychologist which sets out a great deal of history provided by the prisoner. I have a report dated 18 November 2013 prepared by an Alcohol and Other Drug worker and the Acting Manager, Offender Services and Programs, of the Department of Corrective Services. This is a joint report. I have material relating to a program of rehabilitation in respect of possible occupancy in a residential rehabilitation program attached to which are a number of details relating to rules and regulations relating to that particular program. I also have a number of references from persons that have known the prisoner primarily since he was very young, or since birth, being friends and associates of his parents.
	
	
	The matter proceeded before me last Thursday on the basis that I would consider the remanding of the prisoner pursuant to s 11 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (‘the Act’) and would permit the prisoner to be released on bail to enter the residential program about which not only material is provided as I have outlined, but in respect of which the reporters, particularly Watson Munro and the people from Corrective Services, have largely directed their reports.
	
	
	I indicated last Thursday that listening carefully to everything that had been put and reading the material I could not countenance the remand of the matter pursuant to s 11of the Act. In that regard I am mindful of what was said about s 11 remands in the decision of the R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381 and in a decision cited in the judgment of Howie J of Trindall from the same year [2002] NSWCCA 364. I appreciate of course that Smart AJ in Trindall reflected upon the proposition that to grant somebody a remand pursuant to the section with the understanding the person would later be sentenced to a term of imprisonment did not necessarily impose undue hardship on the offender, if the circumstances were such that the remand was for the purposes of determining the non-parole period. He noted, and I think most judges would understand this, many people offered the opportunity of a rehabilitation program rather than custody would “prefer to take their chances” to cite the words of his Honour from [62]. His Honour pointed out:
	


“Most believe that they will be able to demonstrate marked improvement or rehabilitation, for example, defeating a drug habit, obtaining employment, taking their medication regularly to keep a troublesome condition under control …. After all, going straight to gaol gives them no opportunity of avoiding that devastating experience or reducing the extent of that experience. For many, almost anything is better than that experience.”


	
	He went on to say that given that “unattractive alternative”, a period of waiting and uncertainty is preferred. I understand what his Honour is saying there and I also understand what his Honour Howie J was saying at [29] and [30] of that judgment. There his Honour concentrated on the effective delay in the proceedings and noted that the section:
	


“Can only be utilised in a principal way and upon proper material placed before the Court, otherwise it becomes an instrument of injustice either by raising false expectations in the mind of the offender as to the sentence which will ultimately be imposed upon him or by becoming the justification for the imposition of a sentence which fails to meet the timid expectations of the community as to the punishment to be imposed upon the offender”.


	
	The difficulty in this particular matter, from the perspective of an application to remand the matter pursuant to s 11, was, firstly, the totality of the criminality. Three separate offences of armed robbery, admittedly two committed at exactly the same time, in the context of the prisoner using a knife and threatening people with that knife, reflects serious offending that in the context of the guideline judgment of Henry & Ors ((1999) 46 NSWLR 346), even making all due allowances for relevant favourable subjective circumstances, would require the imposition of a term of imprisonment inevitably greater than the period of time that the prisoner had been in custody at the time that he came before me.
	
	
	On the other hand, the other difficulty was of course that, from my perspective at least, remanding the matter as was suggested for six to 12 months, in the context of the inevitability of an outcome that would require the prisoner to be in custody longer than the time that he had been on remand up till last Thursday, would give rise to what I perceive to be either rightly or wrongly an inevitable injustice to him. This is so because he would be required to come from custody to freedom and then back into custody in circumstances where I would view his return to custody as being potentially capable of jeopardising any advances he may have made during the term of his rehabilitation treatment or confinement.
	
	
	The other issue that concerned me was the fact that the bottom line on the material that was available to me was that I did not feel that I needed a period of remand and a period of time for the prisoner to remain in some rehabilitation centre, to assist me to make important decisions about the sentence to be imposed, particularly the non-parole period in this matter.
	
	
	If I may just turn briefly to the material that was presented on his behalf. I should acknowledge the background or the history that has been provided by the prisoner to Mr Watson-Munro and to the drug and alcohol workers at the Corrective Services. The context of all this is to be found in the references. I have a number of references from obviously respectable, talented people involved with the prisoner’s family and the prisoner over a number of years.
	
	
	What emerges from this material is that the prisoner’s family, his parents I am referring to particularly, are well respected professionals in film and television work. They are well educated. They are responsible and for many years they have been confronted with a son who has had a number of difficulties both behavioural and emotional which have contributed to what appears on his criminal history and which obviously are contributing factors to his offending on this particular occasion.
	
	
	Reference is made to the fact that the prisoner has taken responsibility for his offending. People who attest to the good character of his parents also speak of the finer qualities of the offender. He obviously has both the qualities and the potential that are displayed by his parents in their work lives and in their private lives, but, as I said, it is clear from reading these references he has been beset by difficulties, some of which are adverted to in the report of Mr Watson-Munro.
	
	
	These include what appears to be for a period of time an undiagnosed condition of ADHD, or else an undiagnosed depressive disorder, which had not been addressed for some period of time. As I understand the history available to me the prisoner was not actually provided with any medical assistance in respect of his ADHD until he was about 14 years of age. But even then it must be pointed out of course that there has been a course of offending since that medication had been provided to him, although he had in the past broken from that medication.
	
	
	I am mindful of the fact that his partner and he have a child for which he has great affection. I am also mindful of the fact that he stated as one of his reasons for committing the offence some assertion of need for his child. He is described by one referee as a “kind, intelligent, thoughtful and caring individual” - in the sense of being that way - “at heart”. He has demonstrated on occasions responsibility, both in respect of his partner and in endeavouring to undertake employment.
	
	
	His family are described as both intelligent and “incredibly supportive” and they have endeavoured to try to support him in very difficult circumstances. The support of his family and his parents’ capacity to provide support as responsible people is one of the many factors I have taken into account so far as the prisoner is concerned.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro opines upon a long standing substance abuse disorder relating to both the alcohol and the abuse of Xanax, in the context of what would appear to be symptoms of a major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder. In fact I bear in mind the history that the prisoner gave Mr Watson Munro that prior to the commission of this offence the prisoner had been drinking alcohol at a nearby hotel to the university over a period of time and had consumed ten Xanax tablets. He had limited recollection of the alleged offending.
	
	
	The combination of alcohol and Xanax could lead to what could be described as “impulsive behaviour”. I appreciate of course on the facts that there is no element of sophisticated planning or certainly no element of extensive premeditation on the part of the prisoner. On the other hand, none of the explanations provided explain why the prisoner would be carrying a knife, a screwdriver or a box cutter in the early hours of the morning.
	
	
	The prisoner, however, has expressed to Mr Watson-Munro a strong desire to undertake rehabilitation. Mr Watson-Munro reflects upon his upbringing and I am prepared to accept the history that the prisoner comes from, as I earlier pointed out, a supportive family. He has an older sister. He was educated at Marcellin College for two years. He was unhappy there. It was during this period of time that his Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder remained undiagnosed.
	
	
	He attended a paediatrician at the age of 14 and was placed on Ritalin. On the history he gave Mr Watson-Munro he was placed in a special education class for year 8 with the promise that if his grades improved he would be returned to the main stream, but he was ultimately kept back. He moved onto Randwick Boys’ High for years 9 and 10 and then transferred to Randwick TAFE for a period of time.
	
	
	He stopped taking his Ritalin at one point whilst he was in what was described as year 11, I take it, whilst at TAFE. This was primarily because of what was described as, “the intrusive nature of his anxiety and his depression”.
	
	
	He had been to see a psychiatrist at the age of 16 and was placed on Avanza. His school reports at the time reflected upon him being inattentive and apparently constantly sad in class. He gave a history of being bullied at school. Although he is a fairly formidable size now, he was much smaller during his school years and bullying was a scourge for him and created a great deal of misery.
	
	
	He has had work at McDonald’s. He has worked for Channel 7, I presume through arrangements made on his behalf by his family, who have connections, as I said earlier, with the film and television industries. He endeavoured to commence an apprenticeship as a mechanic at Clovelly but had difficulties with his employer.
	
	
	His history of abuse with Xanax and alcohol to which I have already referred. He has sought professional treatment over a lengthy period of time but up until the present time nothing has apparently diverted him from abuse of either prescribed medication or alcohol.
	
	
	In relation to the effect upon him of custody, Mr Watson-Munro described it as having a “salutary effect”. He expressed to Mr Watson-Munro and others “significant feelings of remorse” relating to the victims of his robbery crimes. Mr Watson-Munro reflected upon the need for him to have intensive therapy of various types on his release from custody. The only psychometric assessment undertaken by Mr Watson-Munro was the Beck Depression Inventory which is a self-reporting test. It reflected upon feelings of sadness, anxiety, irritability and the like.
	
	
	The prisoner’s father had a lengthy discussion with Mr Watson-Munro confirming many of the particulars that were provided by the prisoner and the failings of the education system to assist the prisoner when opportunities were available then to guide him appropriately. His father reflected too upon his remorse for his conduct, the way the prisoner was seeking to assert his responsibility for his child, but also upon the fact that the prisoner had for some months before the offence been alcohol free but apparently had, if I may use the colloquial expression, “broken out” on the night of the offending.
	
	
	The analysis of Mr Watson-Munro reflects upon this history of ADHD and depressive symptoms, abuse of alcohol and related offending, the prisoner’s remorse and also upon the need for the prisoner to receive intensive treatment, both to assist him in his rehabilitation in relation to the abuse of medication and alcohol and also to assist him in other respects of personality development and to address symptoms that arise out of the background of depression and anxiety.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro reflected upon the motivation the prisoner expressed to continue his relationship with his partner and to provide assistance in the support for his child. The Corrective Services report reflected upon the prisoner’s drug and alcohol history, with which I have already dealt.
	
	
	The drug and alcohol workers undertook a ‘treatment readiness’ questionnaire and that reflected upon the positive approach of the prisoner to receiving treatment. The report also notes the insight the prisoner now has to the issues relating to his previous abuse of drugs and alcohol and the reporters note that for any therapeutic intervention to be successful the prisoner would be required to, “challenge himself in a mature manner” to address these issues. That report also reflects upon the suitability of the rehabilitation program which I was urged to admit the prisoner to immediately. The report reflects upon his experience of being in custody for the first time but the report also notes the need for the prisoner to show commitment and “maturity”, to fully benefit from the interventions currently being pursued on his behalf. That is interventions related to potential residential assistance. If given a custodial sentence, he should be encouraged to participate in programs aimed to increase motivation and develop skills to maintain long term lifestyle change and that is clearly the case.
	
	
	The submissions on behalf of the prisoner were, apart from those directed at an order under s 11 of the Act, concerned with the proposition that the prisoner was not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. It was submitted that the offending is at the lower end of the scale and the Court should, if it does not determine that the matter be remanded pursuant to s 11, give particular consideration to the relationship of the non parole period to the balance of a sentence.
	
	
	The Crown in succinct submissions, pointed to the early plea and the prisoner’s cooperation with the police. He correctly categorised the offences as offences of, “desperation”, and he conceded that given the contemporaneity of the offending, each offence to the other, concurrent sentences may be imposed.
	
	
	In sentencing offenders in relation to armed robbery matters the Court is required to have regard to the guideline judgment of Henry and particularly the judgment of the learned Chief Justice at [161] to [171]. His Honour pointed in [162] features that were “sufficiently common” for the purposes of determining a guideline, very much parallel with the circumstances of this prisoner, although one could not necessarily describe the victims as “vulnerable”. His Honour went on to point out that every case will involve considerations of factors which will be circumstances of “aggravation”, such as those identified at [170]. The Court in that matter disclosed, or at least confirmed, that the guideline in relation to matters that might be said to fall within the ambit of factors identified by his Honour, should be in the vicinity of between four to five years full term custody. But it was acknowledged of course, that every case is individual and there will be a number of factors to be taken into account, some arising subsequent to Henry, such as the discount to be given for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. In this matter, the prisoner is entitled to a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate penalty for each offence.
	
	
	The learned Chief Justice earlier in his judgment had acknowledged the accuracy of what had been said about Mahony ACJ in the decision of Lattouf, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, in which his Honour noted:
	


“Principles are necessarily framed in general terms. General principles must of their nature be adjusted to the individual case if justice is to be achieved. For this reason it is, in my opinion, important in the public interest that the sentencing process recognise and maintain a residual discretion in the sentencing judge. There is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it but there are other interests to which the sentencing process must have regard. These are other objectives which the sentencing process must seek to achieve. Paramount amongst these is the achievement of justice in the individual case.”


	
	I was taken by learned counsel for the prisoner, who skilfully represented his interests, to the decision of Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, particularly at [22], where the Court in an appeal against a sentence in respect of the charge of murder of a police officer, reflected upon the remarks of the sentencing judge where his Honour commented upon the age of the prisoner as a matter to be taken into account and that there was a public interest in the case of a young offender in imposing a sentence that deserves a proper opportunity and encouragement for rehabilitation.
	
	
	Of course, I interpose for a moment, the opportunity for rehabilitation would appear to me to be much greater in a case such as this than in a case involving an offender convicted of murder who would inevitably, whatever the age, be required to serve a substantial term of imprisonment before being eligible for parole. In Hearne the Judge at first instance had reflected upon the considerations of punishment, general deterrence was there regarded as subordinate to the need to foster the interest of rehabilitation in the case of a young offender. The Judge cited a number of authorities, some reported, well known to the Courts. Courts have regularly recognised the need and the appropriate case for consideration of the promotion of the rehabilitation in young offenders who are not beyond reform. This was reflected in another case from 2001, R v Blackman & Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121, where the Court in exercise of its discretion dismissed a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed upon a number of people charged in respect of a serious home invasion involving offences of armed robbery and the like. That matter involved Wood CJ at CL reflecting upon, with approval, observations of the South Australian Full Court in decisions such as Yardley v Betts (1979) 22 SASR 108 112 3 and Kovacevic v R (2000) 111 A Crim R 131 and 139. In Kovacevic it was noted in sentencing:
	


“There is still a need to consider all aspects of the matter and to consider the interest of society, the offender and the rehabilitation of the offender. Also in the appropriate case, there may be room for the exercise of mercy and leniency.”


	
	In Yardley v Betts, the late King CJ observed:
	


“The protection of the community is also contributed to by the successful rehabilitation of offenders. This aspect of sentencing should never be lost sight of, and assumes particular importance in the case of first offenders who have not developed settled criminal habits. If a sentence had the effect of turning an offender towards a criminal way of life, the protection of the community is to that extent impaired. If the sentence induces or assists an offender to avoid offending in the future, the protection of the society is to that extent enhanced. To say that the criminal law exists for the protection of the community, is not to say that severity is to be regarded as the sentencing norm”.


	
	Of course in sentencing now in New South Wales, the courts are required to have regard to the ‘purposes of sentencing’ are set out in s 3A. Deterrence, both general and personal, adequate punishment, denunciation and making a prisoner accountable are all relevant matters identified under s 3A, as is the rehabilitation of the offender. Some of these purposes of sentencing of course, were directly taken from the majority judgment in Veen (No 2) v R [1988] 165 CLR 465, particularly at 476, where the majority said:
	


“However, a sentencing is not a purely logical exercise and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from the unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different conditions.”


	
	Of course, when a young offender commits offences of this seriousness, and particularly several offences at about the one time, there must be some element of general deterrence and personal deterrence required. To my mind, this is one factor, in conjunction with the other matters I have identified in the prisoner’s prior criminal history, that militate against the remand sought.
	
	
	On the other hand of course, as the Crown has pointed out, there are features of this matter that reflect upon the prisoner’s somewhat confused mental state at the relevant time, particularly the absence of aggravating factors such as premeditation or planning.
	
	
	With regard to s 21A of the Act, apart from those matters I have already identified which form part of the factual matrix of the offending, there is no particular aggravating factor identified pursuant to s 21A(2). The prisoner was not on conditional liberty. As far as mitigating factors, the conclusion I reach is that the injury, loss or damage caused by the prisoner was not substantial in respect to the armed robbery matters, although of course there was substantial damage in the attempted larceny matter. None of the offences was part of planned or organised criminal activity.
	
	
	Of course one could not conclude that the prisoner did not have any significant record of previous convictions, was a person of good character, was unlikely to offend or even had good prospects of rehabilitation. But on the other hand the prisoner has, through the reporting of the Corrective Services drug and alcohol officers and Mr Watson-Munro, revealed at least some insight into his circumstances that reflect upon the capacity of the prisoner to respond positively to a period of parole which he has not had before.
	
	
	I accept that the prisoner has, although he did not give evidence before me, expressed remorse to his father and to Mr Watson Munro and to some of the character referees, has expressed sentiments that reflect that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged such loss or damage as has been occasioned by his actions. His plea of guilty is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3) of the Act, but again he receives a discrete discount for that.
	
	
	The principles set out in the majority judgement of Pearce v The Queen are required to be taken into account. I have determined, ultimately, that I should not make all the sentences concurrent with one another. There should be some degree of partial accumulation, but only slight, to reflect the principles that are laid down by the majority of the High Court in Pearce ([1998] 194 CLR 610 particularly at [45]).
	
	
	I have determined that there are ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to s 44 of the Act: the youth of the prisoner and the need to prevent the prisoner from becoming institutionalised by an extended period of supervision. Most importantly, in the somewhat significant adjustment of the non-parole period by reference to the balance of parole, a very substantial period of parole supervision to give the prisoner the opportunity to adjust to community living and to give the prisoner by parole supervision the capacity that he has expressed to Mr Watson Munro and to the drug and alcohol workers at Corrective Services to undertake the changes in his life that he necessarily must take if he is to avoid coming back before this Court sometime in the future. He certainly needs a great deal of intensive assistance in relation to not just drug and alcohol matters but in relation to matters reflecting upon his background of personality and emotional dysfunction which are, it would seem, a constant threat to his capacity to lead a law abiding existence.
	
	
	Sir, I am just going to make the orders in relation to the matters to which you pleaded guilty. Each sentence reflects a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence.
	
	
	In relation to the offence of attempted larceny, or attempting to steal from a motor vehicle, you are convicted. You are sentenced to six months imprisonment to date from 9 September 2013, that will expire on 8 March 2014.
	
	
	In relation to the armed robbery, the last robbery in time committed against Mr Castillo, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of 11 months to date from 9 September 2013 and expiring on 8 August 2014. I direct that you be released to parole on that date. I fix a balance of sentence of one year seven months, the sentence will expire on 8 March 2016.
	
	
	In relation to the armed robbery upon Mr Wong and the armed robbery upon Mr Ilinj, in respect of each of those offences you are convicted. In respect of each offence you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non parole period of eight months. Each non-parole period shall date from 9 December 2013 and expire on 8 August 2014. In respect of each sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years one month.
	
	
	The sentence I have imposed dating from 9 December 2013 will expire on 8 September 2016. At the end of the non-parole period I direct that you be released to parole. The conditions of parole will be fixed by the Parole Authority by regard to the remarks on sentence I have just made, but will include a requirement for you to undertake appropriate drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs and received appropriate medical and psychological treatment.
	
	
	The total sentence, thus, I have imposed is a sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 months. The greatly extended period of potential parole supervision is to provide adequate time to address the matters that I have referred to in my judgment.
	
	
	Do you understand the sentence I have imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You will be released to parole on 8 August 2014 and you will be subject to parole supervision for two years and one month. That will mean, unlike any other supervision you have had before, that if you fail to comply with the directions of the parole authority your parole will be revoked, you will be arrested inevitably and you will be taken back into custody and you will spend such time in custody as the parole authority directs.
	
	
	So, the opportunity is provided for you within a relatively short period of time on your release to make good on the promises that you have given to other people, your parents, Mr Watson-Munro, your partner and the drug and alcohol workers from the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Thanks, your Honour.

		19 May 2016",2014-03-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763443,State of New South Wales v Cruse (No. 2) [2014] NSWSC 128,"Judgment1On 9 November 2007 the Defendant was sentenced in respect of three serious sex offences being two counts of assault with an act of indecency and sexual intercourse without consent (the ""index offences"").  The victim of these offences was his step-daughter who was 16 years old at the time.  He was sentenced overall to a non-parole period of four years commencing 10 December 2007 and concluding 9 December 2011 with an additional term of two years expiring 9 December 2013.  He did not seek, and has not been granted, parole and his overall sentence expired on 9 December 2013.  
2On 5 December 2013 the State of New South Wales made application for an extended supervision order under s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""C(HRO) Act"") and sought interim supervision orders under ss 10A and 10C.  On that day I made an interim supervision order for 28 days which has been three times extended.  This interim order expires on 9 March 2014. This judgment concerns the State's application for a final order under the Act.  
3The index offences are not serious sex offences because the Defendant's stepdaughter was an adult for the purpose of the Act (see the definition of child in s 4) and the offences were not committed in circumstances of aggravation within the meaning of ss 61I and 61L Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (see s 5(1)(a) C(HRO) Act).  However, the Defendant had been previously convicted on 30 April 1993 of offences that amount to serious sex offences.  I shall refer to these offences later in this judgment.  The Defendant's conviction in 1993 for these offences means that he is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 of the Act.  Since the Defendant was in custody at the time the present application was made he is a supervised sex offender - s 5I.  That enables the State to make the present application - see s 5H.
4What had to be demonstrated for an ESO to be made was formerly found in s 9(2) of the Act but is now to be found within the definition of a high risk offender in s 5B(2).    
5The Act was formerly known as the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW).  It was amended, relevantly, by the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Amendment Act 2013 (NSW) which rearranged important sections of the Act to accommodate the inclusion in the Act of what are called high risk violent offenders.  However, despite the rearrangement of various provisions in the Act, identical or similar wording of these provisions has been been maintained so that the learning which had been developed in the case law will remain of assistance.  
6Section 5B provides that if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender can an extended supervision order be made.  Section 5B(2) says:
An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.
7In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASC 206; 176 A Crim R 110 Wheeler JA (with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) said at [63]:
In my view, an ""unacceptable risk"" in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.
8In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; 198 A Crim R 149 Steytler P and Buss JA said at [27]:
The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case ... '. 
9In State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 I said at [90]:
Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending.  The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"".  The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand.  It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. ...  
The Defendant's background
10The Defendant's personal background is set out in some detail in the reports of the psychiatrists Dr Jeremy O'Dea of 23 January 2014 and Dr Andrew Ellis of 7 January 2014.  It is not necessary to repeat that history in this judgment.  It is sufficient to note that the Defendant is an Aboriginal man brought up in a home that involved violence and alcohol.  His father died when he was very young and at the age of about ten he was sent to a boys' home in Goulburn.  He ran away from that home and was sent to another home in Tumbarumba where he says that he was physically and sexually abused by his foster parents.  
11That abuse appears to have affected him significantly because, for a period of time, he explained his subsequent criminal sexual behaviour by reference to it.  Although, as will appear later, the Defendant seems to have accepted his wrongdoing and the involvement of alcohol and cannabis in his offending, the physical and sexual abuse he endured as a teenager reappeared during the assessment by the psychiatrists in recent times.   
12The Defendant has a long history of sexual offending.  
13In August 1974 at Tumut Children's Court he was charged, at the age of 17 years, with rape.  The circumstances were that the Defendant had consumed alcohol and entered the bedroom of the victim who was aged 15 years and was ""severely mentally retarded"".  He engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse and was disturbed when the victim's sister turned on the light and screamed.  The Crown accepted a plea at Goulburn Supreme Court on 14 February 1975 to a charge of carnal knowledge.  By way of sentence he was committed to the care of the Bungarimbul Anglican Children's Home for a period of two years and six months.  
14On 15 September 1980 he was convicted at Port Augusta Criminal Court of attempted rape.  He had become infatuated with a young woman living next door to him.  He attempted to get her drunk and then tried to force her to have sexual contact.  He was sentenced to nine months hard labour.  
15In October 1983 he was convicted at the Court in Moruya of two charges of sexual intercourse without consent and assault a person with an act of indecency.  The victim was a three year old boy.  The Defendant did not know the child or his family.  The Defendant entered the victim's house at night and laid down with the child in his bed.  He inserted his penis into the child's mouth and took the child's penis into his own mouth.  The Defendant was very drunk at the time and said he could not recall the details due to his intoxication.  He was sentenced in Wollongong Supreme Court on 5 November 1984 to concurrent sentences of 3 years and 6 months.
16In September 1991 the Defendant grabbed a ten year old girl by the hand in a shopping arcade and pulled her into the men's toilet.  He penetrated the child's vagina with this fingers and forced her to fellate him twice ejaculating into the child's mouth on each occasion.  He was charged and released on bail.
17In January 1992 whilst he was on bail for those offences he was introduced to a 16 year old woman at a hotel dance.  He offered to drive her home.  He drove past her house, stopped the car at a boat ramp and made advances towards her.  She tried to get out of the car but was pulled back by the offender who forcefully touched her breasts and tried to kiss her.  The Defendant punched her in the face and digitally penetrated her while she continued to struggle.  To stop her struggling he jammed his fingers down her throat causing her to choke.
18On 30 April 1993 he was sentenced in relation to all of these offences with both victims.  (These were the serious sex offences referred to earlier.)    He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with a minimum term of five years and six months.  He was refused parole in 1998 and later opted not to reapply.  He was released at the end of the head sentence in January 2001.  
19The facts involved in the index offences are these.  The victim was the daughter of the Defendant's partner and the assaults took place in the bedroom of the daughter, a bedroom she was sharing with her two younger sisters at the family home.  The Defendant had been drinking heavily.  He entered the bedroom and laid down beside the victim who was sleeping on a mattress on the floor.  He fondled and squeezed her breasts and left in response to complaints from one of the other girls in the room.  However, he later returned and put his hands inside the victim's shorts and put his finger in her labia although the Sentencing Judge indicated that there was no significant penetration.  He then licked the victim on the outside of her boxer shorts in the area of her vagina.  
20The Sentencing Judge, whilst noting the seriousness of the offence which included the large difference in age and the fact that the victim was a member of his household considered that the offences were at the low end of the seriousness range and sentenced accordingly.  
21The State sought and obtained information about the Defendant's history from other organisations and jurisdictions.  Some of the material obtained was from the Australian Federal Police about two alleged rapes in Canberra in late 1985.  The Defendant was investigated as part of the enquiries.
22The Defendant objected to the evidence about these matters being admitted, relying on s 135 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  The State relied on s 25 of the C(HRO) Act to argue that the material must be admitted.  Section 25 relevantly provides:
(1)   The Attorney General may, by order in writing served on 
any person, require that person to provide to the Attorney General any document, report or other information in that person's possession, or under that person's control, that relates to the behaviour, or physical or mental condition, of any offender.    ...(3)   Despite any Act or law to the contrary, any document or report of a kind referred to in subsection (1) or (2A), or any copy of any such document or report, is admissible in proceedings under this Act.
23The State argued that subs (3) had the effect that s 135 Evidence Act had no operation with respect to material obtained under s 25.  After the hearing concluded and I had reserved my decision an email was sent to my associate from the Crown Solicitor explaining that the material from (inter alia) the Australian Federal Police was not obtained pursuant to s 25.  Its admissibility was, therefore, at large.
24Mr Scragg, for the Defendant, argued that the material's prejudicial nature outweighed its probative value particularly because the Defendant was not convicted.   In fact the matters did not proceed to trial.  
25The evidence is, in the first place, relevant to matters listed in s 9(3)(a) and (i) of the C(HRO) Act: State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 976 at [39].  In most circumstances allegations alone are likely to be sufficiently prejudicial that they would outweigh any probative value.  In the present case, however, records of interview with the Defendant demonstrate some concerning admissions.  In an interview on 10 December 1985 this appears:
Q58. The girl has also told us that you punched her about the face several times when you were in the grassland area.  What do you have to say to that.A. I wanted to hit her but I didn't want to hurt her real bad.
Q59. Why did you want to hit her.A. I wanted to get physical with her to keep her there.
Q60. Did you in fact punch her.A. I remember punching her but I can't remember having a clenched fist.Q61. Why did you punch her.A. Because she didn't want to have sex with me. Q62. Where did you punch her and how many times.A. I think I punched her in the side to start with and then I remember hitting her a couple of times in the face. Q63. What happened then.A. She then agreed to have sex if I didn't punch her.
Q64. Did you have sexual intercourse with her. A. Yes I did. Q65. Can you tell me how you did that.A. I undone my trousers and lifted her dress and layed (sic) her down on the ground and then I got on top of her and had sexual intercourse with her.
Q66. Why did the girl have sexual intercourse with you. A. So that I wouldn't hit her anymore.
...
Q71. Where did you go.A. We went down to a drain way and continued having sex down there.
Q72. Why did the girl go down there with you.A. I don't think she said anything when I asked her to go down to the drain.  Q73. Do know why she went with you to the drain. A. Probably afraid of getting hit again.  I wasn't going to punch her again anyway.
...
Q98.  ... What did you do after you grabbed the woman.A. I saw that one of the doors was partly open and I had asked her to go in there she said what are you doing this for I think I said I'm not going to hurt you I just want your money and after I had got her into the room I asked her to take her clothes off.
Q99. Can you describe that room for me.A. It was a very small tool shed or something.
Q100. Why did you ask her to take her clothes off. A. Because I wanted to have sex with her. Q101. What happened then.A. I then took my clothes off, not completely, and asked her to have oral sex, she said I don't know what to do cause I haven't done this before I then told her just to put it in her mouth, after doing that for a short time I asked her to turn around and lean forward then I had sex with her from that position. Q102. Was the woman agreeable to having sex with you.A. She probably wasn't agreeable but there was no indication        shown by her that she wasn't.
26The last segment of the extract (questions 98 to 102) concerns a second woman with whom the Defendant had sex on the same evening as the woman discussed in the earlier parts of the record of interview.
27There was no evidence before me to suggest that the admissions contained in the record of interview were not freely made.  The admissions of violence in connection with a desire for sex are consistent with some of the offences for which the Defendant has been convicted and are consistent with the assessments made of the Defendant by the psychiatrists.  Its probative value far outweighs any prejudice to the Defendant. 
Expert assessments of risk of re-offending
Narcisa Sutton
28The Defendant was examined at the request of the Commissioner of Corrective Services by a senior psychologist with the Department, Narcisa Sutton.  She prepared a report dated 8 October 2013.
29A useful starting point is the Executive Summary of that report which relevantly says this:
Mr Cruse has a documented history of childhood trauma, as a member of the Stolen Generation, and has suffered frequent periods of clinical depression leading to suicidal ideation and behaviour. He also has a significant history of alcohol abuse, and there is evidence that the majority of his offences have been committed while heavily intoxicated.
Until his current period of incarceration Mr Cruse had been reluctant to participate in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) Sex Offender Programme. He is now in the final stages of completing CUBIT and his participation appears to have been consistently conscientious. His written work, and his discussion of the dynamics of his offence behaviour demonstrate significant gains in insight.
Actuarial assessment of sexual offence risk, based on his offending history, places Mr Cruse in the high risk category relative to other sexual offenders. His therapeutic gains and reported family support may attenuate this risk level, as long as Mr Cruse remains abstinent from alcohol and committed to an offence-free life style. However in my view the stability of these gains is as yet unproven, thus his risk remains high and on-going supervision from Community Corrections would be essential to monitor his progress and assist with his goals. Mr Cruse stated that he is aware of his need for on-going assistance to maintain his treatment gains, and welcomes the added support an ESQ might provide.
30Ms Sutton carried out a series of tests and assessments on the Defendant.  Two of those which concern the likelihood of sexual re-offending are the Static - 99R instrument and the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP).  
31The Defendant's total score on the Static - 99R was 7 which places him in the high risk category relevant to other male offenders. The recidivism rate for those who score 7 is around 5.25 times higher than the recidivism rate expected for ""typical"" sex offenders (those scoring a two on the instrument).  Around 96% of the sexual offenders in the routine sample  scored below the Defendant's score.  
32The Static - 99R instrument has limitations which Ms Sutton acknowledges.  This view was shared by the two psychiatrists who provided reports and gave evidence.  
33The RSVP was developed to assist in the identification and management of a comprehensive range of factors identified by the literature as related to sexual offending.  It includes a total of 22 both static and dynamic factors grouped into five domains, sexual violence history, psychological adjustment, mental disorder, social adjustment and manageability.  These factors are not mutually exclusive.  
34It is not necessary to detail all of the sub-categories of the five domains and how the Defendant fits into those categories and meets the criteria.  It is sufficient to note that Ms Sutton concludes that the Defendant presents with risk factors in all but one of the domains covered by the RSVP.  That, she said, suggests that the high risk score on the Static - 99R is an accurate reflection of his risk.  
35She concluded that when the Defendant is likely to re-offend it would most likely be while intoxicated.  It is likely to be spontaneous rather than be preceded by the grooming of the victim.  The offence is likely to unfold quickly and the victim is more likely to be an adolescent girl.  
36Ms Sutton also said that the Defendant's long history of sexual re-offending suggests that without ongoing support to implement the skills learnt in therapy, at least in the early stages after his release, he was likely to return to the high risk behaviours associated with his offending.  
37Ms Sutton examined various documents made available to her dealing with the Defendant's response to supervision at various times including when he had been on parole.  His record in that regard was somewhat mixed although the most recent conditional liberty in 2005 was completed satisfactorily.
Dr Jeremy O'Dea
38Dr O'Dea interviewed the Defendant at Dr O'Dea's rooms on 20 December 2013 and at the Munyara COSP (where the Defendant resides) on 16 January 2014 for a total of four hours.  Dr O'Dea provided a detailed report about the Defendant's personal history.  He also provided considerable detail about each of the sex offences in respect of which the Defendant has been convicted.  In doing so he sought and obtained the Defendant's recollection of the offences together with his reactions to them.
39In relation to the Defendant's reaction to his offending Dr O'Dea said this:
Whilst he conveyed remorse for many of activities through his life, in particular his sex offences, he readily returned to the injustices and trauma he had suffered through his life, often as direct or indirect justification for his actions.
40Dr O'Dea considered the Defendant's main psychiatric problems were with long standing alcohol and cannabis use disorder, sex offending behaviours associated with his substance abuse, sexual deviance and personality problems including a diagnosis in 1992 of paranoid personality disorder.  Dr O'Dea considered his longstanding Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder should be assessed and treated by a psychiatrist in the community in the long term.  He thought successful management of his moods was likely to reduce the risk of further alcohol or other drug use and offending behaviour.  
41Dr O'Dea said that whilst his history of trauma and disadvantage might help understand the genesis of his substance abuse, forensic and psychiatric problems, Dr O'Dea did not draw a direct causal connection between his history of trauma and disadvantage on the one hand and his sex offending behaviours on the other.  Rather, his sex offending was best understood in the context of his alcohol and cannabis abuse, his apparent sexual deviance including his reported awareness of a sexual attraction to female children, and his personality profile that would satisfy the psychiatric diagnostic classification of antisocial personality disorder.
42His overall sex offending behaviours could be best understood in the context of a strong and deviant sex drive, often expressed impulsively when disinhibited by alcohol and cannabis use, and with coercive and sadistic components at times that might in part be instrumental. 
43Dr O'Dea said it was reasonable to assume that the Defendant has a significant risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours including a risk of committing a further serious sex offence as defined in the Act.  
44Dr O'Dea considered that the judicious use of testosterone lowering medication was likely to prove the most effective intervention because it was unlikely that psychological therapies alone would adequately manage his risk of committing a further serious sex offence in the long term.  
45Of some concern was the Defendant's reaction to Dr O'Dea's suggestion of anti-libidinal medication.  The Defendant told Dr O'Dea that he probably would not take such medication even if he was told to do so.  He said he would take medication for anxiety, depression or pain but when it came to matters of sexuality he said he had worked on his offending behaviour through CUBIT.
46Significantly, Dr O'Dea thought that the Defendant's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community and of committing a further serious sex offence was likely to be relatively long term and of at least five years duration.  He said, therefore, that from a psychiatric risk management perspective any appropriate risk management program should be long term and at least of five years duration.  It should be regularly monitored and reviewed every six to twelve months depending on the Defendant's progress.
Dr Andrew Ellis
47Dr Ellis interviewed the Defendant on 23 December 2013 for a period of three hours.  He had available to him a large number of documents that formed part of the exhibits in these proceedings.  At the time of the assessment the Defendant had been out of custody for two weeks living in a COSP facility.  He was not working but was collecting a Newstart allowance.  He was not taking any medication nor seeing any health professional but was scheduled to start a psychological group for sex offenders and to arrange drug and alcohol counselling.
48Dr Ellis appears to have focused more closely on the Defendant's personal background and behaviours, and Dr Ellis did not go into great detail concerning the sex offences individually.  However, when he gave an account of the offences to Dr Ellis he provided the following:
He describes being intoxicated with alcohol, or suffering from a hangover for all the offences. He reported that he enjoyed the feeling of orgasm during the offences, that they were exciting, that he was experimenting and that at the time he did not care about consequences. He thought that some of the victims were giving him signals, but that now he is aware that he was misinterpreting neutral behaviour. He thought at the time that he was entitled to sex, that others had taken it from him and had gone unpunished (referring to his repost of sexual abuse in childhood). He justified his actions as okay, and did not care that they were against the law. He reported that the offences towards children were motivated by his fascination for young girls, that he really enjoyed his first girlfriend, that this was an experience that felt like normal and not like being the kid from the boys home. He reported that he wanted to recreate this kind of experience for himself.
49Dr Ellis also reported the following:
He reports that he has always had a ""fascination"" for school-aged females. He reports that their appearance is attractive to him, he finds them beautiful and the uniform is alluring. He reports that approximately 40% of his masturbatory fantasies have been directed towards under-aged females. He reports that he is more aware of this direction of his sexual arousal now, and it provides some kind of answer for him about his offending behaviour. He feels that he is trying to recreate his first sexual experience with his girlfriend.
50Dr Ellis said that the Defendant now accepted full responsibility for his offences, that he was very selfish and greedy, and that he was not respecting the law or other people.  Dr Ellis diagnosed him with Paedophilic Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  He thought there was sufficient information to conclude a diagnosis of Personality Disorder with features of schizoptypy, borderline and anti-sociality.
51Whilst recognising the limitations of Static - 99R Dr Ellis concurred with the total score provided in the report of Ms Sutton.  
52Dr Ellis said that deviant sexual arousal was consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual re-offence.  He said that the Defendant's offence history indicated that pattern of arousal for some offences.  Dr Ellis thought there was direct nexus between his masturbatory fantasy and criminal action.  He noted psychological coercion used with some of the victims and serious physical coercion for at least one of the offences.  Dr Ellis said that if alcohol and cannabis use was not addressed it might lead to further cognitive problems, poor emotional regulation and deviant sexual disinhibition.  
53Dr Ellis noted that he had completed a group sex offender treatment program whilst in custody.  He said the persons who completed such programs were in a group that demonstrated lower rates of recidivism.  He noted the Defendant's age and said that increasing age was associated with less general criminal behaviour and specifically less sexual offending. 
54Dr Ellis considered the type of possible sexual offence in estimating the Defendant's risk.  He said the most likely type of victim would be a child or woman in a situation where they were alone or in a position of vulnerability.  An additional victim could be a minor placed under the Defendant's supervision.  Physical and psychological injury were foreseeable.  
55Dr Ellis thought the Defendant would fall into a group of persons where the risk of offending was high and greater than a theoretical average offender.  Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce the risk.  
56Dr Ellis thought that from a chemical perspective anti-libidinal medication was indicated in the Defendant's case if his mental state allowed it.  Dr Ellis did not assess his capacity in that regard.  As he did to Dr O'Dea, the Defendant indicated to Dr Ellis that he was not currently interested in that type of medication but would consider it if he was finding recurrence of paedophilic fantasy when in the community.  Dr Ellis thought that the Defendant should be referred to a forensic psychiatrist with experience prescribing that type of medication so that the medical assessment and further explanation could be provided to him.
57Dr Ellis thought that it would be ideal if the Defendant was reviewed by a forensic psychiatrist over the course of his rehabilitation.  He thought the Defendant may benefit from anti-depressant medication.  He thought that the Defendant would require formal intervention to assist in abstaining from both alcohol and cannabis.  He thought that it would not be effective for the Defendant to rely solely on self-help groups such as the twelve step programs.  He thought the Defendant might benefit from anti-craving medication for alcohol.
58In relation to the frequency and intrusiveness of monitoring including electronic monitoring Dr Ellis thought it should be gradually reduced in response to positive progress.  
59In relation to the period of supervision Dr Ellis said this:
From a psychiatric perspective a period of five years is considered reasonable in order to establish a baseline function in the community, and refine the appraisal of risk.  Paedophilia is a chronic, relapsing condition and resistant to treatment and rehabilitative efforts.  He has multiple co-morbid psychiatric conditions that impact upon likely treatment and supervision response.
60Dr Ellis thought that a period of 24 months would be required to secure stable accommodation, a stable mental state and regular, meaningful activity in the community.  During that time he thought it unlikely that a person would have the focus to benefit from intense sex offender therapeutic activity.  He said a further 24 months of regular treatment in a psychological program, coupled with review for the need for medication and review of medication would be necessary. The psychological program would focus on methods for controlling deviant sexual arousal.  He suggested the additional 24 months because the Defendant's mental state, paraphilia, Substance Use Disorder and current attitudes to supervision meant that things would be unlikely to change in the short term.  Finally, Dr Ellis thought a further period of 12 months would be required to monitor the consolidation.  
61He thought that the Defendant's psychiatric disorders were chronic and were likely to persist beyond any period of supervision.  However, he thought that by the end of five years he would have reached an age where sexual offence recidivism was rare.  
The Defendant's attitude to the order
62Mr Scragg of counsel, who appeared for the Defendant said that whilst the Defendant would not consent to an Extended Supervision Order (ESO) such an order was not opposed.  Mr Scragg accepted that there was evidence available which, if accepted, would justify the making of an ESO.  
63The Defendant, however, submitted that certain of the conditions sought to be imposed were inappropriate or unduly burdensome. In addition, the Defendant submitted that the period of the ESO should not be five years.  The Defendant indicated that he would not oppose a term of two and half years.
64The conditions which the State asks to attach to the ESO are, for the large part, conditions that are normally attached to ESO's for serious sex offenders.  I accept that it is necessary to have regard to whether each and all of those conditions should be imposed upon any particular Defendant because particular matters relating to one offender might be of little significance for another.  
65I have looked carefully at the conditions sought to be imposed.  Subject to what appears below in relation to the conditions that are opposed by the Defendant I consider that all of the other conditions should be attached to the ESO.  In coming to that view I take into consideration that those conditions were not disputed by the Defendant.  
Condition 20B
66This condition provides:
The defendant must not contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly), or attempt to contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly) with any near relative of the victim of the index offence who is under the age of 16 years, unless such contact or communication is permitted by order of a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). 
67The condition sought at an earlier time by the State was this:Without limiting condition 19 above [a condition preventing the Defendant from associating with any persons specified by the departmental supervising officer), the Defendant must not contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly) with, or attempt to contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly), with any near relative of the victim of the index offence. 
68Argument at the hearing was directed to the earlier form of this condition.  What is contained in [66] above was put forward only when the matter came back for further argument on the day immediately preceding the day on which the final orders were required to be made.  At the hearing the State submitted that the purpose of the condition was to prevent contact with the Defendant's two sons to his former partner Megan Perry.  At the time of further argument the State submitted that the condition was also designed to prevent the Defendant having contact with the underage children of the victim's sisters.
69The Defendant submitted that the prohibition contained in this condition should not extend to prevent him from having contact with his sons XYZ and ABC and their mother Megan Perry.  It appears that XYZ and ABC are aged seven and eight years respectively.  They were born to the Defendant and Megan Perry.  The victim from the index offences was a child of Megan Perry from a prior relationship.  It is not clear when the Defendant last had contact with his sons but Dr O'Dea reported that at the time he saw the Defendant, the Defendant had no current contact with his sons.  It seems likely that he has not seen his sons since he was incarcerated in November 2007.
70Nor is it clear when he last had contact with Megan Perry.  The Defendant told Dr Ellis that he did not know the whereabouts of the boys as they had been in the custody of their mother or with the Department of Community Services.  In fact an order to that effect was made by the Children's Court at Cooma on 31 March 2009 varying earlier orders made on 23 August 2006 and 21 February 2007.
71The Defendant submitted, not only that this order if made should exclude any reference to his sons, but also that s 11(g) of the Act, which specifically enables the making of a condition that prevents an offender from associating or making contact with specified persons, was invalid as being inconsistent with the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) at least insofar as it could be used to prevent an offender from having contact with his or her children.
72There was some debate about this issue at the hearing and the question of the issue of Notices under s 78B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) was raised by me and discussed with counsel.  By reason of the need for any order to be made by 9 March (therefore, effectively 7 March because 9 March was a Sunday) I said this during the hearing:
Mr Scragg, my prima facie view is that the Act is not inconsistent, but there may be limitations on conditions that can be imposed under the Act.  I do not think, at the moment, that it is a matter that I should adjourn proceedings to issue notices to the Attorneys General.  I will hear anything further you want to say when we are dealing with this condition later on about it.  I will give consideration to the 78B point in my final judgment.  If I form the view at that stage that notice should be given, I will notify the parties and I will not issue a final judgment and I will bring them back.  But I just don't think it is something I should now decide on the run when there are these time issues involved.
73Notwithstanding, and without any reference to me, the Crown Solicitor issued s 78B notices to all the Attorneys-General in the Commonwealth.  This created a serious timing problem because of the duty on the Court not to proceed in the cause until a reasonable time had elapsed since the giving of the notices (s 78B(1)).  
74I was advised on 6 March that responses had been received from all of the Attorneys indicating that they did not wish to be heard on the point.  I was also advised that the parties had agreed on modifications to the proposed conditions that were said to overcome the constitutional problem.  This also involved the Defendant withdrawing submissions asserting a conflict between the Family Law Act and the C(HRO) Act.
75However, the problem raised cannot be solved in that way.  The jurisdiction of the Court under the Act is not one that can be established or satisfied by consent between the State and a defendant either as to the making of an order or as to the conditions that are imposed.  Section 11 requires the Court to consider the conditions ""appropriate"".  A lack of opposition to any given condition may make it easier for the Court to find it appropriate but that will not necessarily be so.  Further, when a constitutional issue is raised the Court must satisfy itself that any condition imposed does not conflict with any federal Law.  This necessitated further argument on the issue on 6 March.
76The delay occasioned by the issue of the s 78B Notices meant that orders had to be made on 7 March with reasons to follow.
77The Defendant submitted that Part VII Family Law Act deals with children.  In particular Division 2 of the Part provides for parental responsibility.  S 61F provides:
In:
   (a) applying this Part to the circumstances of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child; or
(b) identifying a person or persons who have exercised, or who may exercise, parental responsibility for such a child;
the court must have regard to any kinship obligations, and child-rearing practices, of the child's Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture.
I note in passing that there was no evidence in these proceedings about kinship obligations or child-rearing practices of the children's Aboriginal culture.  The relevance of the Defendant's reliance on this section was, therefore, obscure.
78The Defendant pointed also to Subdivision D of Division 8 of Part VII which provides for circumstances where allegations of child abuse and family violence arise.  The Defendant' argument  appeared to be, by analogy with what was decided in Commonwealth of Australia v The Australian Capital Territory [2013] HCA 55, that s 11(g) of the C(HRO) Act cannot operate concurrently with the aforementioned provisions of the Family Law Act.  The Defendant drew attention to s 68N Family Law Act and what is provided for in the definitions of family violence order and family violence in ss 4 and 4AB respectively.  The Defendant pointed out that the C(HRO) Act is not a prescribed State Act under the Family Law Regulations for the purposes of the regime in Division 11 of Part VII of that Act.
79The State argued that there is no inconsistency arising from any intention of the Family Law Act to cover the field that the C(HRO) Act is concerned with relevant to s 11(g).  Further, the State argued that there is no direct inconsistency between the State and Commonwealth laws.  At best there might be operational inconsistency if an order was made under Part VII Family Law Act that was otherwise incapable of performance by reason of the condition imposed pursuant to s 11(g).  However, that is not the case here because no order had been made under Part VII.
80In my opinion the State's arguments should be accepted.  In P v P [1994] HCA 20; (1994) 181 CLR 583 the joint judgment said:
19. A law of the Parliament conferring jurisdiction upon a federal court in general terms will, in the absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary, ordinarily be construed as not intended to confer jurisdiction to make an order authorizing or requiring the doing of an act which is specifically prohibited and rendered criminal by the ordinary criminal law of the State or Territory in which the act would be done. Of course, the nature of the jurisdiction or the matters which have historically been determined in the exercise of that or a like jurisdiction may suffice to make clear such a contrary intent.
20.  Quite apart from any question of constitutional power, the reason why a law conferring jurisdiction in general terms is to be construed in the manner indicated is that it is ordinarily to be presumed that it is the intent of the Parliament that jurisdiction conferred in general terms will be exercised in the context of, and within the confines imposed by, the ordinary criminal law of the relevant State or Territory. That approach to construction is prima facie applicable to the provisions of the Family Law Act conferring welfare jurisdiction with respect to children of a marriage upon the Family Court.
21.  On the other hand, that ordinary approach to construction does not extend to the case where the State or Territory prohibition under criminal sanction is not imposed solely as part of the ordinary criminal law, but is imposed as an integral part of a statutory scheme conferring upon a local judicial or administrative body jurisdiction or powers which overlap or compete with the jurisdiction conferred by the Commonwealth law. Nor is it applicable to a case where the State or Territory prohibition is imposed as part of a general regulatory scheme which operates within the very area which the jurisdiction validly conferred by the Commonwealth law was intended to control. In such cases, there is no presumption that it was the intent of the Parliament that the jurisdiction conferred by the Commonwealth law should be overridden by, or subjected to, the prohibitions and requirements of the overlapping or competing State or Territory scheme. If, in such a case, the terms and operation of the Commonwealth law disclose a legislative intent to cover the relevant field, s.109 of the Constitution will apply to render invalid the State or Territory law to the extent that it intrudes within the area validly occupied by the Commonwealth law. If the terms and operation of the  Commonwealth law disclose no such legislative intent, the existence and extent of inconsistency between the Commonwealth and the State or Territory laws will depend upon the terms and operation of each. Commonly, when that is so, the State or Territory law will be inconsistent with the Commonwealth law and invalid pursuant to s.109 of the Constitution to, but only to, the extent that it would ""alter, impair or detract from"" (Victoria v. The Commonwealth (""the Kakariki"")) the Commonwealthlaw's conferral of jurisdiction by directly or indirectly precluding, overriding or rendering ineffective an actual exercise of that jurisdiction. The practical effect of that pro tanto invalidity of the State or Territory law is that orders made in the exercise of the Commonwealth jurisdiction will prevail over the provisions of the State or Territory law or orders made or acts done in the exercise of power or authority which the State or Territory law purportedly confers.

81The Court of Appeal in Western Australia in Dunne v P [2004] WASCA 239; (2004) 29 WAR 232 noted that the Bail Act 1982 (WA) was not a prescribed law of the state for the purposes of the definition of ""family violence order"" in the Family Law Act.  The Court held that P v P was distinguishable because the prohibition in the Bail Act which made it an offence to breach a condition imposed on a defendant's bail was imposed as part of the general criminal law.  The condition in that case was one which prevented the defendant from contacting his wife in any way.  An order had earlier been made by a Court of Petty Sessions under the Family Law Act preventing the parties to the marriage from telephoning one another ""save and except in the case of an emergency or matters affecting the welfare of the children"".  It was held that the bail condition was not invalid or inoperative.
82In AA v BB [2013] VSC 120 Bell J held that there was no inconsistency between the Family Law Act and the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic).  His Honour held at [105] that the Family Law Act did not intend to exclude State law with respect to family violence.  Similarly, Marshall J held in Juries Against Illegal Laws Incorporated v The State of Tasmania [2010] FCA 578 that the Family Violence Act 2004 (Tas) was not invalid as being inconsistent with the Family Law Act.
83I do not consider that there is indirect or ""cover the field"" inconsistency (see Victoria v The Commonwealth (1937) 58 CLR 618) between the Family Law Act and s 11(g) C(HRO) Act.  Part VII of the Family Law Act assumes the existence of State laws in relation to such matters.  Nor is there direct inconsistency because it is not necessarily the case that orders under each Act will be incapable of performance together.  However, it may be the case that at some point operational inconsistency will arise.  Sections 68P and 68Q Family Law Act contemplate such inconsistency and provide for it.
84Provided that the condition imposed under the C(HRO) Act does not preclude the Defendant being able to apply under the Family Law Act, there is no present inconsistency between the two Acts.  If the court having jurisdiction under the Family Law Act makes an order enabling contact with the Defendant's sons operational inconsistency may arise.  As the State submits, there is no conflicting order at the present time.
85If the condition does not preclude the right to apply under the Family Law Act, the ESO will not be removing any rights of the Defendant, contrary to the Defendant's submission.
86An affidavit was read on behalf of the State which annexed a statement by the victim of the index offences pursuant to s 21A of the Act.  The affidavit also annexed a statement from the victim's mother who was the former partner of the Defendant.  There was no objection to this statement although its status and relevance must be doubtful.  The statement said this:
I, Megan Perry, mother of [XYZ] and [ABC] wish that an AVO be taken, on our behalf, against Edward Cruz (sic).  I as the parent also do not want him to have access to either of his children.  I have no desire for him to know of the whereabouts of myself or the two boys.  Further, I do not want him to know of their educational facilities or any personal; information.
87Whilst I understand Ms Perry's perspective, the issue of contact with the Defendant's sons cannot be based on Ms Perry's views about the matter.  This Court is not the appropriate place for the determination of the rights of parents to have contact with their children except insofar as the C(HRO) Act requires the imposition of a condition on an ESO based on the risks that must be considered from the evidence adduced on an application such as the present one.  Nor is it appropriate for this Court to impose a condition that would prevent the Defendant from applying to the Family Court or other court given jurisdiction under the Family Law Act if he chooses to do so.  Such a condition may well be struck down under s 109 of the Constitution.
88Further, it is always open to a Defendant to make application to this Court under s 13 to vary or revoke an ESO which would include varying or revoking a condition imposed.  If the Defendant wished to make contact with his sons it would always be open to him, if the Family Court was minded to accede to any such application, to apply to this Court also with evidence to have the condition varied or removed.
89The purpose of the conditions of the ESO is not to punish the Defendant but to protect those who might be potential victims.  
90The Defendant has said to a number or doctors and psychologists that he is entirely heterosexual and has no homosexual inclinations.  Nevertheless one of the victims of his offending was a three year old boy.  As noted, the offence was committed when the Defendant said that he was very drunk and had in fact entered the wrong flat where the child was sleeping.  He told Dr O'Dea:
I think it happened because I was insecure ... lonely ... and sexually inadequate ... I wasn't normal ... I'd just got out of a bad marriage.
91In the light of Ms Sutton's opinion that re-offending was most likely to occur while the Defendant was intoxicated with the offence being spontaneous and the psychiatrist similarly being of the view that the combination of a deviant sex drive expressed impulsively when disinhibited by alcohol and cannabis, I consider that there is an unacceptable risk that the Defendant may commit a serious sex offence involving the boys.   I note that there was no restraint on his actions despite the fact that the victim of the index offences was his step-daughter and the offence took place in the home.  
92On the other hand, I can see no basis upon which it is appropriate to restrict the Defendant from having contact with Megan Perry if he wishes to do so.  If, as appears, she does not wish him to contact her she is in a position to say so to him and, if necessary, in appropriate circumstances, obtain an Apprehended Violence Order if that is what she fears.  She is not a victim under this Act and her statement cannot provide a proper basis for so restricting the Defendant.
93Nor, in the circumstances where the Defendant has no desire to make contact with the victim's sisters' daughters, is there any basis for this particular condition including other than the Defendant's sons.  These other children are sufficiently protected by other conditions such as 19 and 25.
94For the reasons given earlier the condition in should be varied to provide:
The defendant must not contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly), or attempt to contact or communicate by any means (directly or indirectly) with his two sons to his former partner Megan Perry unless such contact or communication is permitted by order of a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). This condition does not prevent or restrict the Defendant making application to the Family Court of Australia or any other court having jurisdiction under the Family Law Act in respect of his sons.
Condition 34
95This condition provides:
The Defendant must not purchase, possess, access, obtain, view, participate or listen to material classified as Refused Content, X18+, R18+, restricted category 1 and restricted category 2, or any other material as directed by the departmental supervising officer.
96The Defendant submits that there should be no prohibition on his accessing material within the classification of R18+.   The Defendant submits that this material is available to anyone over the age of 18 years with movies with such classifications being shown on television and cinemas.  
97The State argued that the Defendant should not be entitled to access material classified as R18+.  I was taken to parts of the CUBIT treatment report which tended to show a link in the Defendant's mind between violence and sexual arousal particularly in relation to children.  The following passages were said to be relevant:
25. ...As a result, his sense of entitlement increases and he becomes sexually aroused to thoughts of power and domination over vulnerable victims (e.g, children)
26. As a result of this work, Mr Cruse identified that at the time of offending the following factors resulted in a sexual offence: using alcohol and other drugs; not using supports; not managing thought of revenge; being sexually aroused to thoughts of violence; sexualising women and children; feeling sexually and emotionally inadequate; using sex to cope; being sexually preoccupied; and, being alone with children.
...
41. Historically, Mr Cruse had difficulties with his sexual self-regulation. He was sexually preoccupied, which manifested through prolific sexual activity (e.g., one night stands both in and out of longer term relationships, ""private dancers"", use of pornography and masturbation two or three times a day).  Mr Cruse felt sexually inadequate in adult relationships.  Therefore, he sexualised children (e.g., ""she was dressed elegantly"") and used sexual thought and behaviours to feel in control and adequate (e.g., sexual thoughts about children and violence).
...
43. It is recommended that Mr Cruse continue to monitor his sexual thoughts and behaviours, and implement strategies to manage inappropriate sexual thoughts.  In particular, due to his difficulties managing thoughts of revenge and his sexual arousal to thoughts of violence, it will be important for Mr Cruse to take responsibility for his sexual thoughts and behaviour at times when he is having difficulty managing his emotions.
98The State argued that violence was a significant issue in films with an R18+ rating.  That could, however, be said also of films with lower ratings and about many television shows.  It is necessary to be realistic and, as both Doctors O'Dea and Ellis said, to draw a line that is ""practical and implementable"".  Where films classified as R18+ are shown on television, let alone at the cinemas, and there is no suggestion that the Defendant should not be permitted to watch television it is completely impracticable to include a condition that prevents his accessing such films.  
99It is, however, appropriate to restrict the Defendant from accessing material with the other ratings.  I accept, as the psychiatrists acknowledge, that a healthy sexual outlet is important for the Defendant, but as Dr O'Dea said, with some agreement from Dr Ellis, the aim of his treatment was to refocus him away from sexual issues and particularly deviant sexual matters.  His access to any form of pornography was not going to be helpful.
100Condition 34 should be altered to omit any reference to material rated R18+.
 Condition 37
101This condition provides:
The Defendant must not use or attempt to use equipment for the purposes of recording still or moving photographic images of persons reasonably known by the Defendant to be the age of 16 years or under.
102The Defendant submits that he should not be prevented from taking photographs of his sons XYZ and ABC.  Because of the determination I have made in relation to condition 20B this consideration does not arise.   However, the parties agree that there should be added to the condition the following:
unless those persons are his children and contact with those children is permitted by order of a court exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth).
In the light of the foregoing discussion I also agree that it is appropriate to add those words to the condition.
Condition 47
103This condition provides:
The Defendant must take any antipsychotic, anti-libidinal (including SSRI's) or other prescribed medication if and as prescribed by a medical practitioner.  The note at paragraph 52 below applies.
104Paragraph 52 provides:
It is noted that the ""reasonable directions"" (in condition 3) and the participation in treatment (in conditions 46 and 47) do not include participation in treatment, or requiring the Defendant to take medication that may be prescribed, without his informed consent.
105The Defendant submitted that he should not be required to take anti-libidinal medication.  He accepted that, in the first instance by reason of paragraph 52, the Defendant cannot be forced to go onto anti-libidinal medication. Indeed, the psychiatrists say that no-one should be forced to take it against their will.  That would have to be true of other medication prescribed for the Defendant also including any anti-depressant medication.  The only people forced to take medication are involuntary patients under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) or perhaps the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW).
106The Defendant's concern is that if, at some stage the Defendant agreed to take anti-libidinal drugs but then did not want to continue with them, he would be in breach of condition 47 with possible criminal sanctions.  This, of course, would apply to all medication in that situation.
107It is not at all clear how the regime contained in paragraphs 46, 47, 49 and 52 of the conditions is supposed to operate.  It is not appropriate that the Defendant be at risk of criminal sanctions for not wanting to take any drugs even if they are prescribed nor for not wanting to accept some form of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  If paragraph 52 expressly enables the Defendant to refuse the drugs or treatment at the beginning it is illogical that he should not be entitled to refuse the drugs or treatment at a later time.  It is not apparent what flows from, or happens after, a notification under paragraph 49.
108Of course, in the long term it may work against the Defendant if he will not accept treatment, including by drugs.  If he has not been rehabilitated by the expiry of the ESO a further application may be made by the State.  I do not accept, however, that by the imposition of conditions under the present Act the Defendant can be forced to take medication or undergo treatment that he does not wish to undertake.  As I have said, the psychiatrists, do not consider that course to be appropriate.
109The regime set out in paragraphs 45 to 52 of the conditions is well-intentioned.  It is useful if it remains to encourage the Defendant to follow professional advice in relation to all forms of treatment.  In my opinion, paragraph 52, on its proper construction, is not confined to an initial refusalto undergo treatment or to take a prescribed medication.  It continues to apply so that if, at a later time, the Defendant does not wish to continue some form of treatment including taking medication he is free to do so subject only to making the notification required by paragraph 49.  In that way, it is not necessary to remove the reference to anti-libidinal drugs from paragraph 47.
The length of the ESO
110The State sought the maximum period of five years during which the ESO will be in place.  The Defendant said that he would not oppose an order for two and a half years.  The Defendant pointed to what was said by Howie J in The State of NSW v Colin John Fisk [2009] NSWSC 778 and what was said by Spigelman CJ in Faheem Khalid Lodhi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 360.
111The case of Fisk does not provide any assistance.  Howie J noted that the State submitted the order should be in place for five years with the Defendant submitting it should be place for no more than 12 months.  Howie J fixed on the period of three years based on his assessment of the risk of re-offending.  He added:
Within that period the Defendant can seek a variation or revocation of the order and should have the onus. Thereafter the State can seek a further order and should have the onus to show that it is required for the protection of the public.
 That is simply the position that the Act contemplates.  
112Lodhi was an appeal concerning (inter alia) the sentence for an offence concerned with terrorism.  The issue of protection of society (Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 and 477) was a relevant consideration.  In that context, Spigelman CJ said:
[106] The difficulty of predicting future behaviour, which is in any event inherent in other sentencing principles including general and personal deterrence and rehabilitation, is often referred to as one of the defects of reliance on individual incapacitation as a basis for increasing the severity of a sentence. The other significant issue is the sense of unfairness of punishing a person not for what they have done, but for what they may do in the future. (See generally Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins Incapacitation: Penal Confinement and the Restraint of Crime (1995) Oxford University Press, New York, at 62ff; Andrew Ashworth ""Criminal Justice Act 2003 (2) Criminal Justice Reform: Principles Human Rights and Public Prosecutions"" (2004) Criminal Law Review 516 esp at 519-521; Mirko Bagaric ""Incapacitation, Deterrence and Rehabilitation: Flawed Ideals or Appropriate Sentencing Goals?"" (2000) 20 Criminal Law Journal 21 esp at 28-29; Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth Principled Sentencing: Readings on Theory and Policy (1998) Hart Publishing, Oxford Ch 3; Andrew Ashworth Sentencing and Criminal Justice 4th ed (2005) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge at 80ff.)
113It can be seen that the remarks were made in the entirely different context of the appropriate sentence for a crime that had been committed.  That is not what the Act under consideration here is concerned with.  It is not to punish further a Defendant for a crime for which he has served his or her sentence.  It is principally for the protection of society but also with the rehabilitation of the Defendant as a consideration.
114It may be accepted that there is a difficulty in predicting future behaviour.  However, that is a necessary element in the making of any order under the present Act.  The Court must look to the risk of future behaviour guided by professional opinion and other considerations as the Act requires.  
115The evidence from the psychiatrists in this case points strongly to a five year period for the order.  Dr Ellis provides detailed reasons which deal with the focus of the treatment and rehabilitation of the Defendant.  Independently, Dr O'Dea considers that the risk will last for five years.
116Dr Ellis, when challenged by Mr Scragg about the length of the order, said this:
I think what I am suggesting there is that treatment ought be long term given that the condition itself is unlikely to remit, paedophilia is unlikely to remit in two years and, in fact, it is likely to continue on beyond the length of any order that the Court would make.  But the first period of 24 months is more about re-integrating someone into community society plus looking at issues around sexual offending and after that period, which is really a stabilisation period in my view, then a further 24 months of regular treatment is required for consolidation of that and I have given that length of time based on the number of co-morbid problems that are presenting alongside the paedophilia and the previous responses to rehabilitative efforts.  So, again, my psychiatric view for a period of five years is based, not just on the types of interventions that would have the best chance of reducing risk, but also the likely chronicity of the problems and the number of problems that Mr Cruse has presented with. (emphasis added)
117There is a further matter which tends to reinforce Dr Ellis's view that the Defendant's problem is a chronic one and is unlikely to remit any time soon.  During the Defendant's incarceration for what were arguably his worst offences (the serious sex offences) with the second committed whilst on bail for the first, the Defendant wrote on 27 April 1998 to the Parole Board as follows:
In the past I was always to proud to accept any form of help, but with the right kind of help, encouragement, and a lot of re-thinking, I eventually saw a bright future in front of me.  For me to think that far ahead, I realised the first thing that I should do was to accept full responsibility for my actions, and to seek the necessary help required.  Right throughout my sentence I have fixated myself on the Judge's comments, and I truly believe that I have followed through (without apprehension) to address my offending behaviour.
... I have concentrated and focused on these issues realising that needed desperately to give up Alcohol and other Drugs completely, and to live a drug-free life upon my release.
...I am forty years of age, and at this point in time I have never been more serious or dedicated in reforming or rehabilitation and I understand fully the meaning of these two words.  I have been honest with myself and the Department of Corrective Services and I have humbled myself to enable the necessary changes to take place.  I have reluctantly considered changes in the past, but after making these vital steps, I do feel a better person.
This sentence has been the biggest struggle of my life thus far but after these adjustments, I feel very confident of not ever re-offending and returning to prison.
118Perhaps somewhat presciently, the Parole Board refused the Defendant parole and he was released at the end of his sentence in January 2001.  The index offences were committed in January or February 2005.  Assuming, charitably in the Defendant's favour, that he meant what he said in that letter, his later re-offending demonstrates clearly the pervasiveness of the Defendant's problems.  It is no surprise that both psychiatrists independently thought that five years (or even more) was needed to ensure any hope of rehabilitation.
119I have given earnest consideration to whether a shorter period should be imposed, leaving it to the State to demonstrate after that time that the Defendant still remains an unacceptable risk.  However, I consider that the evidence points strongly to the need for a lengthy period of supervision which includes treatment.  The Defendant has offended constantly since the age of 17.  The offending may be partly explicable from a psychiatric point of view because of a very scarred childhood with alcohol and drug addiction superimposed.  But that does not mean that the unacceptable risk is not there for future re-offending.  As I have mentioned earlier, the purpose of this legislation is not punitive but protective.120Having heard from the psychiatrists the sense I have, particularly from Dr Ellis, exemplified in the passage I have set out at [116] above, is that they are not optimistic about any cure of the problem, and certainly not in any short-term period.  Dr Ellis speaks of the problem extending beyond the time of any order the Court can make.
121I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the Defendant poses an unacceptable risk for a period of at least five years.  If that position changes it is always open to the Defendant to apply under s 13 to be released from the order or to vary its conditions.  I cannot be satisfied any other course is appropriate for the protection of potential victims.

2763459,R v Hadchiti (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 257,"Judgment

 

1On 13 November 2013, a jury convicted the offender, Michael Hadchiti, of the murder of Billy Mack, the boyfriend of his sister, Marian Roumanos, after a trial at which he gave evidence that he had killed Billy Mack in self defence, after Billy Mack attacked him with a knife, when he came to the defence of his mother, Sonia Hadchiti.

 

2He now stands for sentence for his offence.

 

This Court's task

 

3I will begin by explaining how the offender's sentence must be arrived at, by reference to what legislation enacted by the Parliament and binding case law requires in a sentencing exercise such as this.

 

4After a jury verdict, the sentencing judge must take a view of the facts relevant to sentencing which is consistent with the verdict which the jury has reached, with any reasonable doubt being resolved in favour of the accused (see Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14]). Disputes as to factual findings have to be resolved in the way discussed in The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270, where it was observed at [27]:

 

""...that a sentencing judge 

 

""may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities."" 

 

 

5The rules of evidence do not otherwise ordinarily apply at a sentencing hearing (see s 4 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)), but nevertheless, the weight of the evidence which the parties then lead must be critically assessed.

 

6The sentence imposed on the offender must reflect the gravity of his offence, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). That was in issue in this case. It must be determined in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question, which in the case of murder is life imprisonment (see s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) requires, however, that a sentence of life imprisonment only be imposed on an offender, if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme, that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. The maximum sentence of life imprisonment is thus reserved for extreme offences of murder.

 

7It is a matter for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1). In this case the Crown did not seek to do so. I accept that this is not a case which warrants the imposition of such a sentence, notwithstanding its obvious seriousness.

 

8The Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence (see s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence.

 

9Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are amongst the factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, as was discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 and is now provided in s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

 

10In arriving at a sentence the Court must also bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Those purposes are:

"" (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,

(c) to protect the community from the offender,

(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,

(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,

(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,

(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 

 

 

11The Court must also consider identified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence (see s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). The offender's moral culpability for the offence must also be taken into account (see the discussion in Muldrock and in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 302 ALR 207). Consideration must also be given to questions of general and specific deterrence.

 

12All of the relevant factors must be taken into account by way of the instinctive syntheses discussed in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]. That is, identifying all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discussing their significance and making a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence for the offence. The sentence so imposed must ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]).

 

13Regard must also be paid to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed on an offender must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period imposed, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances which warrant a departure from that ratio. Whether special circumstances should be found in this case was also in issue between the parties.

 

14If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628).

 

15In this case, for reasons which I will explain, justice demands that a significant custodial sentence be imposed on this offender.

 

The offence and its seriousness

 

16It was common ground at trial that it was the offender who had killed Billy Mack.

 

17The Crown's case was that Billy Mack was attacked, seriously assaulted and fatally wounded with a knife, shortly after he entered the front yard of the offender's home; that others present were involved; that the offender did not act in self defence; that he was not provoked by Billy Mack; that those involved later conspired to conceal how Billy Mack was killed; and that this eventually extended to influencing Marian Roumanos to depart in her evidence at trial from the accounts which she had given to neighbours and police on the night of Billy Mack's death and when she gave evidence at the committal hearing.

 

18The Crown's case was a circumstantial one. While it did not have to establish every particular fact on which it relied beyond reasonable doubt, it had to prove that the established facts, when viewed as a whole, established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender murdered Billy Mack.

 

19The jury convicted the offender of murder being satisfied, despite the evidence he and his mother gave, that the Crown had established all elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

 

20The jury reached that verdict in the face of the evidence given by those who were present at the offender's home when Billy Mack was killed, apart from the offender's sister-in-law and four children. They were the offender's parents, Sonia and George Hadchiti, his brothers John, Mehriz and Rabih and a family friend, Bishawi Amin. Marian Roumanos and Billy Mack's niece TM, then aged 13, who were waiting together for Billy Mack on the road outside the yard where Billy Mack was killed, were also called. Applications under s 38 of the Evidence Act were granted without objection in relation to all these witnesses apart from TM. Those witnesses all received certificates under s 128.

 

21Evidence was also called from neighbours, police and ambulance officers who attended the scene, treating doctors and various experts.

 

22In convicting the offender the jury rejected the evidence given by the offender, Sonia Hadchiti and other witnesses present when Billy Mack was killed, when it conflicted with that given by TM, accepting the Crown case that there had been a successful attempt to interfere with Marian Roumanos' evidence prior to the trial. Her evidence, when it departed from accounts which she had earlier given to police and when she gave evidence at the committal hearing, which had supported TM's evidence, was also rejected.

 

23Despite the offender's resulting conviction, on sentencing, there was a considerable dispute between the parties as to the objective seriousness of his offence. The Crown's case was that it was a serious offence, falling above the mid-range of such offences. The offender contended that his offence fell at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness, because his attack on Billy Mack was unplanned and motivated by revenge for Billy Mack's attack on his mother. That, it was argued, would mitigate to a limited extent, the objective seriousness of his offence and would also reflect on his moral culpability, the need for personal deterrence and an assessment of his risk of re-offending.

 

24The offender's case was that the jury had concluded that he had acted in excessive self defence, self defence and provocation having been negatived beyond reasonable doubt. He also contended that on the evidence it was open to the jury to have reasoned that there was no prospect that an ordinary person in his position ""could have formed the intent in the circumstances such as to excuse homicide/murder to one of manslaughter"" because his response to the assault on his mother was wholly disproportionate. In the result he submitted that:

 


	it was thus open to the jury to conclude that the incident between he and Billy Mack had started in the way he had described;


 


	his motive was revenge for Billy Mack's attack on his mother; and that


 


	the murder had not been planned.


 

 

25The offender accordingly submitted that it would be found that:

 


	Given the conflict between the evidence of Marian Roumanos and Sonia Hadchiti, it could not be concluded that she was aware that Billy Mack was coming to collect the children before 9:07pm, despite their earlier telephone communication at around 5:30pm.


 


	Even if that was rejected, the evidence did not establish that Sonia Hadchiti or George Hadchiti, who was in close proximity when Sonia Hadchiti spoke to Marian Roumanos, had told the offender that Billy Mack was coming.


 


	In the result it could not be concluded that there was any planning.


 


	Sonia Hadchiti had suffered musculoskeletal pain as the result of Billy Mack's attack on her.


 


	Sonia Hadchiti's differing accounts of what had happened to her were the result of the shock which she had suffered.


 


	The wound to the offender's wrist was not self-inflicted, but had been inflicted by Billy Mack.


 


	The offender went to the defence of Sonia Hadchiti while Billy Mack attacked her.


 


	Marian Roumanos had sought and obtained her parents' approval to return to their home on the Friday evening before Billy Mack's death.


 


	The offender's motive was not disapproval of his sister's relationship with Billy Mack, but revenge for the attack on his mother.


 

 

26The Crown's position was that none of these findings were open. The jury had accepted TM's evidence. It did not leave open a finding that Billy Mack had attacked Sonia Hadchiti or that the offender had come to her defence. That was also negatived by the injuries which Billy Mack had suffered. The evidence which the offender had given about these injuries was fanciful. The jury had rejected his evidence and that given by the other members of his family as to what had happened that night. None of that evidence could account for the injuries which were inflicted on Billy Mack. Given the speed of the attack on Billy Mack by a number of people when he entered the yard where he was killed, it could also not be found that no planning was involved. What was planned was not sophisticated, but it was effective.

 

27The Crown also submitted that the findings sought by the offender had to be approached in light of the evidence which established that the offender's family had forced Marian Roumanos to change the accounts she had given to police and at the committal hearing. While initially denying contact with her mother prior to giving her evidence, the evidence established that they had been in recent phone contact at least 50 times. She had also been in contact with her two other brothers. In the result, it had to be concluded that parts of her evidence, such as that which she gave as to a visit to her family home on the Friday night before Billy Mack's death, was designed to hinder the Crown's case.

 

28That evidence was the result of the influence which had been brought to bear upon her by her family. That was submitted to be one part of a cover-up in which the offender had been involved and which still persisted, which reflected badly on him and other members of his family. The evidence given by the offender and the other family members would be found to have been untruthful in every respect.

 

29The issues lying between the parties have to be resolved in the face of the offender's conviction despite the evidence which he, his mother and various others present that night gave; the facts which were not in issue at the trial; and what the offender accepted on sentencing.

 

30Given the nature of those issues it is necessary to go to the detail of the evidence, to explain why the evidence given by the offender and his mother is not a reliable foundation for the findings which he sought on sentencing and why they are not available on the evidence on which he was convicted.

 

31The offender and his mother both gave evidence that they were alone in the front yard with Billy Mack; that Billy Mack first argued with Sonia Hadchiti and pushed her to the ground and then attacked the offender with a knife, injuring his wrist, when he went to his mother's aid; that Billy Mack was killed during their ensuing fight, in which only he and the offender were involved; and that after the fight ended, Billy Mack rolled over and tried to crawl away.

 

32The offender's evidence was that he had not intended to kill Billy Mack. He inflicted the fatal wound during a struggle over control of Billy Mack's knife, while Billy Mack was lying on his back on the ground and the offender was above him.

 

33The jury convicted the offender even though his self defence case was supported in various respects by the evidence given by his parents, his brothers, a friend and by some of the evidence given by his sister, Marian Roumanos. The jury rejected all of that evidence as not being an honest account of how Billy Mack came to die. The verdict reflected a conclusion that it was neither credible nor plausible, but rather designed to shield the offender from conviction and to conceal who else was responsible for Billy Mack's death.

 

34What was not in issue at trial included that Billy Mack drove to the offender's home to collect Marian Roumanos' two children, after dropping TM's friends at the station and stopping to buy something; that Marian Roumanos and TM waited for him on the road outside; that Sonia Hadchiti and the offender were in the front yard when he arrived; and that other family members and a friend Bishawi Amin were also at the house.

 

35On sentencing, the offender conceded that:

 


	The jury had rejected his account of how ""the critical phase of the incident transpired"".


 


	That being so, it was open to find on sentencing that there was more than one offender involved. That was supported by evidence as to the extent of the injuries which Billy Mack had suffered and the evidence of TM.


 


	The evidence permitted the conclusion that the offender inflicted the knife wound to Billy Mack's neck from behind, with an intention to kill.


 


	The jury's verdict was consistent with the evidence of Marian Roumanos and TM that they had heard Billy Mack call out ""let me go you scumbags"" after he entered the front yard of the offender's home, where he was killed.


 


	It was open to the jury to conclude that the offender's response, if the incident had commenced as he had described, was such that the partial defences of provocation and excessive self defence had been negatived beyond reasonable doubt.


 

36These concessions were properly made. When they are considered together with what was otherwise established on the evidence on which he was convicted, it must be concluded that this offence was more objectively serious than the offender submitted and that the findings which he seeks are not open.

 

37The evidence established that Sonia Hadchiti was told well beforehand that Billy Mack was coming to the house to pick up the children. While the yard was in darkness when police arrived later, the offender said that he could see Billy Mack because the yard was lit up by a security light which came on when Sonia Hadchiti came down the stairs into the yard. That illumination also explained how TM was able to see what she described.

 

38The offender was convicted on the evidence of TM and Marian Roumanos which established beyond reasonable doubt that contrary to the accounts of the offender and Sonia Hadchiti, Billy Mack was set upon almost immediately upon entering the yard, when he began crying out ""let me go you scumbags"" and Sonia Hadchiti began screaming.

 

39In the circumstances it is not open to approach the resolution of the issues lying between the parties, other than on the basis that in the event of conflict between the evidence of the offender, Sonia Hadchiti, others present and TM, her evidence must be preferred. Even where there is not such a conflict and where their evidence was supported by that given by Marian Roumanos, their evidence has to be approached with considerable caution.

 

40That is both because the jury rejected the evidence which the offender and his mother gave as to how Billy Mack was killed and because there was a problem with Marian Roumanos' evidence, to which I will return. Marian Roumanos did give some evidence which contradicted the offender's account. That evidence corroborated evidence given by TM, which was also supported by the evidence of other witnesses and by objective evidence. This was accepted by the jury as establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had murdered Billy Mack.

 

41The offender sought a finding that despite this outcome, the verdict was consistent with an acceptance of his description of how the incident with Billy Mack started and that this motivated the killing. I am satisfied that such findings are not open.

 

42Such findings would depend on a conclusion that although the accounts which the offender and his mother gave as to who was involved in the attack on Billy Mack and how his death was caused were not accepted by the jury, they told the truth as to how the events which led to Billy Mack's death commenced. That conclusion is not available. Their evidence was implausible, improbable and shown to be untrue. It is not a basis upon which any conclusions can reliably be arrived at.

 

43The offender's case was that the attack on Billy Mack was unplanned. Sonia Hadchiti was aware that Billy Mack was coming to pick up the children. The offender submitted that the evidence established that at most, Sonia Hadchiti had some three hours' notice, but it did not establish that he knew. His evidence was that he was unaware that Billy Mack was coming, and that he did not know who he was, or of his relationship with his sister. That was contradicted by what was done to Billy Mack when he entered the yard and by the evidence as to what Marian Roumanos had told police about her brothers' disapproval of her new relationship and that she had heard the offender call out ""shamouta's slut"", after Billy Mack entered the yard.

 

44The evidence established that the offender had acted in concert with others. TM's evidence established that they set upon Billy Mack and restrained him, soon upon him entering the yard. Marian Roumanos finally corroborated that account. It was confirmed by the injuries which Billy Mack suffered.

 

45The planning involved in this attack may not have been sophisticated, but it was certainly effective, ensuring that the only person seriously injured that night was Billy Mack.

 

46That no attempts were later made to dispose of Billy Mack's body and that 000 calls were made, does not establish any lack of planning. To the contrary, it is consistent with a planned response to Marian Roumanos' calling out to those attacking Billy Mack that police were coming. So, too, were the steps then pursued by those present to conceal what had happened to him.

 

47The evidence established that accounts which Marian Roumanos had given neighbours and police on the night that Billy Mack died and the evidence which she gave at the committal hearing corroborated evidence which TM gave at trial as to what had happened to Billy Mack. TM's evidence was that he was set upon when he entered the yard, when she heard Sonia Hadchiti screaming and Billy Mack crying out two or three times ""let me go you scumbags"". TM also heard Marian Roumanos calling out that ""the cops are coming, the cops are coming"" and Sonia Hadchiti call out to Marian Roumanos ""in her language"". Marian Roumanos also later told police that she had called out ""the cops are coming"".

 

48TM gave no account of hearing what Sonia Hadchiti variously claimed that she had yelled at Billy Mack, while he was kicking her. TM's evidence was inconsistent with Billy Mack having entered the yard and attacking Sonia Hadchiti, as she and the offender described.

 

49TM could not see clearly into the yard, but described seeing others around Billy Mack and a lot of movement. She heard Billy Mack scream and other male voices yelling and ""going woo"", she explained, like they were ""all happy"". She did not hear her uncle again. She also said that it just went all quiet and that Marian Roumanos was yelling, but that no one was listening to her.

 

50TM was scared by what she had heard and urged Marian Roumanos to leave when she was speaking to her mother. Marian Roumanos was also plainly frightened, fearing for Billy Mack's life. They ran a considerable distance to the neighbours, in order to telephone police. What they then told the neighbours and later police, also suggested that Billy Mack had been attacked by a number of people, almost immediately upon entering the yard.

 

51One neighbour's evidence was that Marian Roumanos told her that they needed to ring the police ""because they were going to kill Billy"". She said that she was frightened to confront her family and as Billy Mack walked in she heard him yelling, ""Get off me. Leave me alone"". The other neighbour recollected her saying, ""I need to ring the police. They are going to kill him"". Marian Roumanos used their phone to call police. She also later spoke to her father on their telephone. The neighbour heard Marian Roumanos yelling, ""Where is Billy"". She then told her neighbour that her father had said to her, ""eat shit"".

 

52The neighbour drove Marian Roumanos back to her parents' home, where police told her that Billy Mack had died. Constable Cavallaro's evidence was that after a crime scene had been established, he spoke to Marian Roumanos, who had come to the driveway entrance. She became hysterical and screamed ""Oh, no, oh my God they executed him"".

 

53Marian Roumanos departed from her earlier accounts, however, when she began giving her evidence at trial. Marian Roumanos then said that both she and Billy Mack were high on drugs that day and that was why she did not want her parents to see her. There was no other reason for her not wanting to go that day to her parents' property to pick up her children. She also said that Billy Mack went crazy when they drove there. He told her and TM to get out of the car and left them on the side of the road in the dark and did not communicate with them at all. When he went into the yard she heard her mother scream really loudly, like something terrible had happened, and dogs began barking. She did not recall hearing anything from Billy Mack.

 

54The hearing was adjourned so that Marian Roumanos could receive independent legal advice. When the hearing resumed, Marian Roumanos' evidence altered. She then said that when Billy Mack entered the yard she, too, heard her mother screaming, which she described as ""just loud screaming"" and Billy Mack screaming out ""take your hands off me you scumbags"" and that she grabbed the phone to ring 000, but the battery was flat. She also thought that she had called out ""the cops are coming"". Having listened to parts of the recorded interview which she had given police on the night that Billy Mack died, which was then played to her and by which she was visibly distressed, Marian Roumanos altered other aspects of her earlier evidence in ways which supported the Crown's case.

 

55It then emerged that Marian Roumanos had left her husband. Her children went to her parents' house on certain weekends. She herself did not go there. She met her mother at a park near the river, so that the children could be handed over. That was because she was not allowed to return to her parents' home until she returned to her husband. Her parents had placed her under a lot of pressure to go back to him. That day she spoke to her mother, who told her that she was cooking for the boys and refused to bring the children to the river and wanted her to go there to collect them. She heard her father asking ""what is she afraid of"". Marian Roumanos refused to go there. Billy Mack was concerned for her and said he would go, even though she did not want him to, because she did not want him to get involved in a fight.

 

56Despite this alteration in her evidence, as her evidence continued, Marian Roumanos claimed not to be able to remember much of what she had told police the night Billy Mack was killed. She could not remember, for example, saying that her brothers had also pressured her to return to her husband, but she agreed that she was then scared of her family, who considered that she had shamed them by leaving her husband. She said she was then concerned that her husband would try to take her children overseas, which she explained Billy Mack did not understand. She described Billy Mack as being ""big hearted"". She then said that he was not in an aggressive mood that night and later, that he was stubborn about wanting to pick up the children.

 

57Marian Roumanos also could not remember telling police about not wanting Billy Mack to collect the children, because she did not know what they were capable of and because her mother told her they did not want him going to the farm. She also denied having made up that she had been heavily affected by drugs that day, which was not apparent on the recorded interview she said, because she was ""not a downer"". Nor could she remember hearing the offender call out ""shamouta's slut"", after Billy Mack entered the yard, although that was what she told police in the interview. She then suggested that she might have been hearing things and gave an account of suffering certain mental health issues. She also denied other things which she had told police about that night, for example, hearing her brother John call out ""fuck your mum"". She then also denied calling out that the ""cops are coming"". She also claimed that her mind was ""not all there that night"". She also denied telling the neighbours that she needed to ring the police because they were going to kill Billy.

 

58It became very evident that Marian Roumanos was not telling the entire truth. In re-examination she agreed with a number of propositions which assisted her brother's defence, including that she was worried that Billy Mack might have started something, but she insisted she heard him screaming and crying out to be let go. She also gave evidence that she had gone to her parents' home on the Friday night before Billy Mack died, told them that she wanted to go home to live with the children and that they had agreed. That evidence corroborated an account which Sonia Hadchiti had earlier given to police, and evidence which the offender later gave, but contradicted her evidence that she was then in fear of her family, who were pressuring her to return to her husband and that she was not permitted to go there until she returned to him.

 

59This account was also entirely inconsistent with her conduct the night that Billy Mack died and what she had told neighbours and police. The jury plainly rejected those aspects of her evidence inconsistent with her behaviour on the night Billy Mack died and what she told neighbours and police that night. That was for good reason. This aspect of her evidence was not reliable.

 

60Given the evidence which the jury did accept, it cannot be concluded that Marian Roumanos' evidence supported the conclusion that the incident which led to Billy Mack's death began as the offender claimed, with Billy Mack's attack on his mother, nor that this motivated him to act as he did, namely for revenge for that attack.

 

61These were certainly possibilities which the jury had to consider. In cross-examination, Marian Roumanos agreed that when she heard her mother scream, she was worried that Billy Mack had done something to her. There was tendency evidence which showed that in the past, Billy Mack had acted violently; that he had carried a knife; and that he had threatened people with knives, including Marian Roumanos' husband.

 

62There was also evidence that Billy Mack was found on autopsy to have taken valium and methadone within a therapeutic range; Xanax, used to treat depression, at a range too low to be pharmacologically active; another antidepressant mirtazapine at a therapeutic level; cannabis, but not at an active level; and methylamphetamine, at just outside the top end of the therapeutic range. That drug could have altered his perception or judgment and made him a little more aggressive or prepared to engage in risk taking behaviour, but the expert Dr Allender could not say that it had had that effect on Billy Mack because the level was not outrageously high and its effect depended on whether or not he was a regular user. It was possible that it had had such an effect, in which event it could have triggered a fight or flight response. The drug could also accentuate aggressive behaviour in people inclined to aggression.

 

63Neither Marian Roumanos nor TM, however, had seen Billy Mack carry a knife that night and neither described him to have been in an aggressive mood, as Sonia Hadchiti and the offender described. Marian Roumanos said that he did not usually carry a knife, that she did not know that he was carrying a knife that night and that he was not then in an aggressive mood. She described him as having been normal and happy, wanting to show the children a duckling he had bought them earlier that day. TM said that Marian Roumanos did not want him to go because her brothers were there and he said, 'If they try anything I'll just leave'. Marian Roumanos told him to be careful.

 

64This was a case where a combination of implausibilities and improbabilities in various evidence, when considered together with what reliable and objective evidence established, precluded there being any reasonable doubt of the offender's guilt. The same combination eliminates the possibility that the offender acted in self defence, motivated as he claimed.

 

65The evidence of the very extensive injuries which Billy Mack suffered, compared to what happened to Sonia Hadchiti and the offender, provided no support for their accounts.

 

66Sonia Hadchiti suffered no visible injuries. Contrary to what she later told the 000 operator and ambulance officers, she had not been stabbed, nor was she was bleeding. She suffered no cuts, bruises or abrasions. Some tenderness was found on later examination, when she was diagnosed to be suffering musculoskeletal pain and treated with analgesics. No other injuries were found, despite X-ray examination.

 

67The only injury which the offender suffered was a small laceration to his wrist, which he said was inflicted when Billy Mack first attacked him. It was not bleeding when ambulance officers attended and was later treated with three stiches. The expert evidence was that it was caused by a knife and that it was probably the result of an assault on the offender, although a self-inflicted injury could not be excluded.

 

68There were two knives found at the scene when police arrived. One belonged to George Hadchiti. Who the second knife belonged to was not established. The offender's evidence was that he was using his father's knife to peel an apple when Billy Mack arrived; that he had it in his hand during their fight; and that it was he who had inflicted the fatal wound with the second knife, which Billy Mack had attacked him with. Which knife inflicted the various wounds which Billy Mack suffered was not established. The expert evidence was that either knife could have inflicted them. This evidence does not establish that the second knife belonged to Billy Mack, or that it was used to attack the offender.

 

69Police found Billy Mack dead, lying face down on the ground in a pool of blood, which had flowed from a very deep, fatal knife wound to his neck. The expert evidence established that it was inflicted from behind, in a sawing motion, rather than in the way the offender described in his evidence.

 

70Billy Mack had also suffered a major laceration to the back of his head, with micro fracturing of his skull, most likely caused from a blow from behind. There was another laceration to the back of his head, a laceration to his right ear, where a piece of his ear was missing, an abrasion above his right ear, and abrasions on the right side of his neck and at the base of his neck. There was an angled L shaped abrasion on his left temple, and another similar shaped injury below. On the expert evidence, these were caused by two separate blows, possibly inflicted when he was stunned or unconscious. There was also a laceration to his left temple, a scratch on his left cheek and an abrasion on his left neck. Billy Mack also suffered a stab wound to his right lung, a stab wound to his left shoulder and abrasion and bruising to his left chest wall. He also had a square bruise in the middle of his back which matched the legs of a metal chair frame found nearby, which had his blood and hair and the offender's DNA on it.

 

71On the expert evidence the wounds which Billy Mack suffered were consistent with him having been pinned in the back by a leg of the chair frame found nearby, while unconscious or stunned, before his throat was cut from behind.

 

72The evidence of the offender and Sonia Hadchiti was that Billy Mack was so injured, after he attacked Sonia Hadchiti and the offender came to her aid. Their evidence was implausible, given the nature of those injuries.

 

73Their evidence also has to be considered in light of the accounts which they gave that night and subsequently, as well as accounts given by others present.

 

74That night the offender and Sonia Hadchiti were taken to hospital for treatment and his father and brothers and Bishawi Amin were taken to the police station to make statements. They were not separated.

 

75Detective Sergeant Clarke's evidence was that when George, John, Mehriz and Rabih Hadchiti and Bishawi Amin were all together in the house amongst other things:

 

""I said ""what happened to him?"" The five males just shrugged their shoulders and George Hadchiti said: ""I do not know"". I said ""He is dead on your front lawn - just outside your front door - none of you know him or know how he died?"" George Hadchiti said ""No"".""

 

 

76This was neither plausible nor true. At trial none of these witnesses gave an account of Billy Mack attacking Sonia Hadchiti, or the offender coming to her aid. The evidence was:

 

George Hadchiti

 


	George Hadchiti told Senior Constable Bruzzone outside the house that he did not see what had happened, he was inside and that he had no idea who the person lying on the ground was. He had heard yelling but stayed inside. When inside the house in the presence of his sons and Bishawi Amin, he told Detective Sergeant Clarke that he did not know the man lying outside and did not know what had happened to him.


 


	His evidence at trial was quite different. Then he said he had heard yelling and went outside where he saw his wife vomiting on the ground with her clothes torn. He saw the offender and Billy Mack grabbing hold of each other. They both had knives in their hands and fell to the ground where they struggled together. He did not get involved. When asked if he saw them stabbing each other he said, ""Yes I saw them hitting each other"", but he did not hear Billy Mack yell out ""let me go you scumbags"". He saw that the offender was covered in blood on his face and his clothes, including his top. That was not the state in which police found the offender.


 


	He denied later speaking to Marian Roumanos on the phone and saying to her ""eat shit"" as Marian Roumanos had told her neighbour.


 

John Hadchiti

 


	John Hadchiti also told Detective Sergeant Clarke inside the house, that he did not know the man outside on the ground and shrugged his shoulders when asked what happened to him.


 


	His evidence was, however, that he was in the granny flat with his wife and the kids when he heard yelling outside. He did not go to investigate for some 10 minutes. When he did he saw his mother screaming on the ground, saying ""help help"", his brother sitting holding his arm, his father on the stairs and someone lying on the ground.


 


	He denied being in the yard when Billy Mack arrived and saying in Arabic ""fuck your mum"".


 

Mehriz Hadchiti

 


	Mehriz Hadchiti told Detective Sergeant Clarke inside the house, ""Same, I do not know,"" when asked who the man lying outside was.


 


	His evidence was, however, that he had heard his mother scream and saw her on the ground crying, his brother next to her, his father outside and something lying on the ground.


 

Rabih Hadchiti

 


	Detective Sergeant Clarke also asked Rabih Hadchiti inside the house, if he knew the man outside, he just shrugged his shoulders.


 


	His evidence was that he heard a loud scream from the front; he saw a bloke physically touching his mother in the chest and her fall and saw the offender and Billy Mack fighting, both holding knives. He did not watch any further and went back into the house and waited until police arrived because it was too dangerous and he did not want to get involved.


 


	In his police statement he had said that his father was out there ""trying to pull them apart"". His evidence was that this was wrong.


 

Bishawi Amin

 


	Bishawi Amin told Detective Sergeant Clarke ""I am here visiting. I do not know him.""


 


	His evidence was that he heard a scream, went to the door and saw the offender and a man he did not know and Sonia Hadchiti between them. He said, ""I saw two knives and mother in middle"". He left and hid outside until police arrived.


 

 

77Those accounts were inconsistent with each other and the evidence which the offender and Sonia Hadchiti gave. They were rejected by the jury.

 

78Sonia Hadchiti's evidence also departed from other accounts she has given of what happened to her that night. She has never given any coherent account of what happened to Billy Mack, even at the trial. Like the offender, she then denied that anyone else other than the offender was present or involved. Sonia Hadchiti insisted that Billy Mack had injured her and that she saw the offender and Billy Mack fight, but she could give no clear account of how Billy Mack came to be killed, notwithstanding that she was in very close proximity.

 

79In her evidence Sonia Hadchiti claimed not to have a good recollection of these events, but she said that Billy Mack had come into the yard aggressively after dangerously braking the car, swearing and asking ""Where are they you fuckin' grunts"". After she asked him ""What's going on, what's wrong with you, where's my daughter?"", he grabbed her, as she was turning away, ripping her t-shirt and pushing her to the ground. He then began kicking her hard to the side and lower back, while she faced the ground and continued asking him, ""What's wrong with you? Where's my daughter, where's my daughter?"" She said that she did not scream initially, but could not get up and kept talking to him asking, ""Why you doing this, what is going on, where's my daughter?"" She began screaming when the offender tackled Billy Mack, after saying, ""what's going on"". As soon as they clashed she saw that Billy Mack had a blade in his hand.

 

80This evidence was inconsistent with that given by both TM and Marian Roumanos. It was also inconsistent with Billy Mack's injuries.

 

81As I have explained, Billy Mack received a number of injuries from the chair frame. The blow which at least stunned him must have been inflicted after he cried out repeatedly ""let me go you scumbags."" It is likely that that blow silenced him. Sonia Hadchiti, however, denied seeing anyone smash Billy Mack in the head with the chair frame, claiming that she saw him fall on the chair frame and crash into it, while he and the offender were tackling together, but she did not know if Billy Mack had hit his head on the chair frame. She said that he was aggressive and described him ""falling to the ground and getting up and struggling with my son"". The offender's uninjured state was entirely inconsistent with the struggle which Sonia Hadchiti described.

 

82Sonia Hadchiti also explained that she was in a bad state and did not know if she had passed out or not during this struggle. Nothing which either she or the offender described as having happened to her, or what later examination in hospital revealed, suggested any reason for Sonia Hadchiti to have been in such a state, other than the horror of what she was witnessing.

 

83Sonia Hadchiti denied seeing Billy Mack's throat being slit. She did see blood, but described that it was Billy Mack who was being very aggressive, going up and down with her son, while she was screaming ""help help"". She said that her husband had come outside and also began calling ""help help"" and ""call the ambulance"", but that he did not get involved in the fight, nor did any of her other sons. At one point she said that she had told her husband to get her phone and one of her boys brought it and she called 000. At another point she said that they only came out of the house when the police arrived. Later, that they had come out when she started screaming.

 

84Sonia Hadchiti also said that she did not want anyone to touch her, even when the ambulance arrived, because she was scared and in shock and very sore. She said she had no cuts, but described being in agony, lying on the ground vomiting and shivering, scared as to what was going to happen to her son, who had come to her defence.

 

85Sonia Hadchiti denied that her account was untrue, or that Billy Mack had been attacked by a number of people, that he had been smashed over the head when he entered the yard, or that he had called out ""take your hands off me you scumbags"". She agreed that both Billy Mack and her son had knives, but denied that her husband had a knife or that he had intervened in the fight. She also denied that her sons said anything when they came out at one stage, other than asking her if she was OK. She also denied that ""shamouta's slut"" was said.

 

86Sonia Hadchiti also denied Billy Mack punching her, despite an account she had earlier given police. She also denied saying that Billy Mack had stabbed her, despite what she told the 000 operator. Contrary to her evidence, she did not tell the 000 operator that her son had been stabbed. Sonia Hadchiti also denied lying and putting on an hysterical act in order to explain why she told police when they arrived, that she was still afraid of Billy Mack. Sonia Hadchiti claimed to have seen Billy Mack crawl away after her son got off on top of him. Given his injuries, that evidence was entirely implausible. She also denied later pressuring her daughter to give evidence to assist her brother, during their many telephone conversations. Given the alteration in Marian Roumanos' evidence, this too was difficult to credit.

 

87Sonia Hadchiti's evidence also departed from earlier accounts which she had given.

 

88Her first account was in the 000 calls which were played at the trial. She was then agitated and at times hysterical. She told the operator that she had been stabbed. The explanation as to why it was she, rather than the others present with her and the offender who made those calls, which she and members of her family gave in their evidence, was implausible and inconsistent with her claimed state and theirs and what they each claimed to have observed that night. The Crown's case was that both these calls and what police found at the scene that night had been staged.

 

89The police arrived at about 9:19pm. Sonia Hadchiti was found lying on the ground, screaming, crying, moaning and clutching at her chest. Her t-shirt had been torn at the front, but no blood or other visible injuries were observed on her, inconsistent with the account that she had earlier given the 000 operator. When asked where she was hurt, she did not answer. She was yelling and heard to say things like, ""help me, he is trying to attack me"", ""he's got a knife, he's going to kill me"" and ""please, please Michael, help me"", even though on her own account and that of others present, she had not moved from the ground since she had been pushed there by Billy Mack. He was lying dead, face down on the ground in a pool of blood nearby. The offender was sitting nearby and her husband, sons and family friend were nearby. By that time, Billy Mack had been dead for some time, consistent with the account Sonia Hadchiti had earlier given the 000 operator as to his unmoving condition.

 

90The offender was sitting holding his wrist which had been wrapped up. Two knives were lying on the ground nearby. The others present were inside the house. The offender told police that Billy Mack had attacked his mum and stabbed him. When asked what happened to Billy Mack, he repeated, ""He attacked my fucken mum"". He began vomiting.

 

91Sonia Hadchiti was moaning and retching. She was assisted to her feet and sat on a chair. She was found not to have any visible injuries. When examined by attending ambulance officers, they found that her t-shirt was ripped and the centre clip of her bra had been cut almost all the way through, but she had no wounds, cuts or bruises. She was still crying and pointing at Billy Mack saying things like, ""Is he going to get up and attack me again?"". The notes made by ambulance officers recorded that she stated continuously that she was bleeding, but no injuries were found. She complained of pain in her hips and across her back. She continued retching in the ambulance, saying that she was scared, and asked whether ""that man was coming to hospital"". It was finally established at the hospital, that she was menstruating.

 

92The Crown's case was that not only was Sonia Hadchiti not telling the truth, her behaviour was not genuine. It certainly could not establish that Billy Mack had assaulted her as she claimed. Even if her behaviour was genuine, it was consistent with Sonia Hadchiti having observed the offender and others present severely assaulting and killing Billy Mack, in a most brutal fashion, consistent with TM and Marian Roumanos hearing her screaming while Billy Mack cried out repeatedly, ""let me go you scumbags"".

 

93While the objective evidence did not establish that Sonia Hadchiti had not been assaulted, it must be considered that her physical condition on later examination in hospital did not accord with several of her accounts.

 

94Dr Aljumha's notes recorded that she was examined for ""alleged assault"", having reported being pushed to the ground, trodden on, kicked with feet on her back and hips and suffering pain in the central back regions and to her left and right flank, as well as hip pain, light headedness and nausea. On examination, she was found to be clinically stable, with no apparent wounds, lacerations or bruises, but with tenderness in her thoracic spine, left shoulder and left and right hip and flank tenderness. The diagnosis after X-ray was musculoskeletal pain, which was treated with analgesics. Dr Aljumha's evidence was that on the history Sonia Hadchiti had provided her, she had expected to find some bruise or laceration. The expert evidence was that a bruise could take time to appear, but that does not explain why the serious assault she claimed to have suffered left her with no visible injury at all.

 

95Sonia Hadchiti had earlier given a different account to police. Then she said that when Billy Mack arrived he told her that her daughter was home sick and that he had shouted at her, ""Why can't you give me the kids, what's the problem''. When she asked him, ""Why you shouting"" he launched at her and pushed her. She pushed him back and then he grabbed her and punched her and she fell to the ground and he began kicking her. She said to him, ""What's wrong with you, have you had something to drink or something"" and then the offender came to her assistance.

 

96The account which the offender gave police immediately on their arrival at the scene and later was that Billy Mack had attacked his mother. The offender heard his mother give evidence. He gave a different account to those which she gave the 000 operator and police, but it corroborated the account which she had given in her evidence.

 

97The offender described Billy Mack walking in towards his mother; being aggressive and yelling ""where are the kids""; his mother looking puzzled and asking, ""why are you going on about the kids""; and Billy Mack swearing and yelling, ""where the fuck are the kids"". He said his mother could not get a word in and Billy Mack then grabbed her from in front and pushed her to the ground, where he kicked her. He could not describe where the kicks landed. He then got up and said, ""What are you doing?"".

 

98Billy Mack said nothing but turned around and swung at the offender with a knife. Initially, he thought he'd been punched, but then realised he'd been stabbed in the left wrist, which he'd raised to block the blow. He then swung back and he tried to grab Billy Mack's arm. He also had a knife in his hand and he tackled Billy Mack to the floor. He said that it was possible that Billy Mack had hit his head on the chair frame as he fell. The offender said ""he pushed back"" and the offender pushed him down and a struggle ensued. The offender said that he was in fear of his life. Billy Mack was going out of control and he was trying to do anything he could to keep him down and away. He could not remember touching the chair frame, but said that it was possible that Billy Mack hit the chair frame again later, when he retackled him. Billy Mack got up at least twice during the struggle and the offender tackled him back down. He described swinging the knife in his hand at Billy Mack and said that ""it is quite obvious that my knife got in contact with his chest"". He said that knife was still in his hand until the end of the fight, when they fought for control of the knife in Billy Mack's hand.

 

99The offender said that Billy Mack was still going crazy. He dropped his knife and got hold of Billy Mack's hand, while right on top of him. They were both on the ground. Billy Mack was on his back, pushing his arms up and the offender was pushing the knife down towards him, struggling for control of the knife. The offender did not get control of the knife. He had his hand on the knife, pushing it down until it went into Billy Mack's neck and then slid down and landed near his neck. The offender did not touch that knife again, but jumped off Billy Mack, who went forward, crawled onto his knees and his hands and collapsed in front of him face down. The offender then got up and walked around to see if anyone else was with Billy Mack, picked up his knife and sat down where he remained until police arrived.

 

100Despite this violent struggle during which he was fighting for his life and Billy Mack was left with significant injuries, lying dead in a pool of blood and despite his father's description of seeing him fighting covered in blood, when police arrived the offender had almost no blood on him or his clothing.

 

101Despite this, the offender denied anyone else being involved in this struggle or hitting Billy Mack with the chair frame; he denied that his account was a fabrication; he denied that Billy Mack said, ""let me go you scumbags"", and he denied killing Billy Mack by slitting his throat from behind, while he was unconscious, or doing so in a sawing motion, or that this explained why he had so little blood on him. When the police arrived, contrary to his father's account, he had some blood on his shoes and the bottom of his track pants and little on the front of his top.

 

102The offender's account of how he killed Billy Mack was rejected by the jury. It and the evidence given by Sonia Hadchiti were implausible. Their accounts were inconsistent with the objective evidence and the evidence given by Marian Roumanos and TM. Their evidence provides no credible basis for the findings which the offender seeks on sentencing, either as to the circumstances in which his fight with Billy Mack began or what motivated him to kill Billy Mack. In the result it cannot be found that such a fight as the offender described occurred, or that it was the result of any attack on Sonia Hadchiti, or that the offender went to her defence.

 

103The seriousness of this offence is established by the evidence which the jury accepted, which established beyond reasonable doubt that Billy Mack was set upon by a number of people, almost immediately upon entering the yard where he was seriously injured and killed. The evidence did not establish that Billy Mack's murder had not been planned, or that the incident began in the way the offender described, or that his motive was revenge for Billy Mack's attack on his mother

 

104A note written by Sonia Hadchiti was tendered on sentence. It said:

 

""As a mother of seven children i am fully aware of the terrible price we have all paid for, what i believe was a ""spare of the moment incident""

 

At this time my thoughts are also for the future of my youngest child Michael who will pay the price for the tragedy i too am paying the emotional price for i accept the courts verdict as i must, my concern now is for the future of my son Michael and so i now look forward to his continued rehabilitation and sincerely believe that he will not reoffend and our family will continue to support him during his incarceration""

 

 

105That note is of no assistance to the offender.

 

106He admitted killing Billy Mack by inflicting a serious, fatal wound to his neck. He was convicted on evidence which established that this wound was inflicted from behind, during a vicious attack on Billy Mack carried out by a number of persons present when he entered the yard, some of whom restrained him. The result was that the only person seriously injured that night was Billy Mack. His repeated screams, demanding that he be let go before he fell silent and the extensive injuries which he suffered, show that he had been rendered incapable of defending himself against those who attacked him and inflicted the serious, painful knife wounds and other serious injuries which he suffered.

 

107For his part, the offender must now be sentenced on the basis that he did not act alone in this vicious, fatal attack and that it was he who inflicted the fatal knife wound, as was his evidence. Objectively, this was a most serious offence. In sentencing the offender it cannot be overlooked that he still actively persists in sheltering those involved with him from the consequences of their part in this terrible crime. It follows that his moral culpability for his awful offence is also high.

 

Aggravating factors

 

108The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevant to this sentencing exercise are:

 

(c) the offence involved the use of a weapon,

 

(e) the offence was committed in company.

 

 

109I have already discussed these seriously aggravating factors and need say no more about their impact on this sentence.

 

Mitigating matters

 

110The mitigating factor specified in s 21A(3)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which it was agreed by the parties was relevant to this sentencing exercise and which I have taken into account is that the offender does not have any record of previous convictions.

 

111The offender also submitted that the following factors would be taken into account in his favour, namely that:

 

""(b) the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity,

 

(f) the offender was a person of good character,

 

(g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend,

 

(h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise,""

 

Planning

 

112As I have already explained, the evidence did not establish that there was no planning involved in this offence. This factor cannot be taken into account by way of mitigation.

 

Good character and youth

 

113The offender was 20 years old at the time of his offence and 22 on sentencing. The evidence established that up until the time of this offence, he was a person of good character. Various character references in evidence attested to his character. He had no prior criminal record.

 

114There was also evidence that when released on bail, the offender worked to complete his trade qualifications and to advance himself in his trade. He has pursued a similar approach, with success, while in custody.

 

115I have taken these matters into account by way of mitigation.

 

Re-offending and rehabilitation

 

116It is more difficult to come to a positive conclusion as to the likelihood of the offender re-offending, notwithstanding his youth, his prior good record, his pursuit of his education and a trade, and what he told the psychologist, Mr Borenstein, about his regret at having caused Billy Mack's death.

 

117That is because the offender has never admitted the serious offence which the evidence established he committed in company and not in self defence. It also reveals his ongoing participation in steps pursued since Billy Mack's death to shield him from conviction and to conceal the others who were involved.

 

118 After conviction, the offender gave an account to Mr Borenstein, consistent with the evidence which he gave at trial. He also told Mr Borenstein of his ongoing struggle with the consequences of his self defence. He had been treated for anxiety and depression prior to going into custody at a time when he found his circumstances difficult to handle. He had no prior history of psychiatric disorder or substance or alcohol abuse, although there was some family history, his sister having been treated for pre and post natal depression. After Billy Mack died, the offender suffered sleep disturbance, weight loss and panic attacks, and became socially withdrawn. His symptoms continued in custody where he received further treatment.

 

119While not accepting responsibility for Billy Mack's murder, the offender told Mr Borenstein of his struggle with being responsible for Billy Mack's death ""day by day knowing a life was taken"". He also told Mr Borenstein ""I was acting in self defence, but I still struggle ... it's hard to live with. I was only trying to defend myself and my mum, I was really scared for my life"". By that account the offender maintained what he accepted on sentencing the jury had rejected, including that he did not act alone in the events which led to Billy Mack's death.

 

120Mr Borenstein found that the offender prided himself on his strong family values and ideals and considered that he was genuinely remorseful, notwithstanding that he continued to claim that he acted in self defence and that he did not mean to cause Billy Mack any harm.

 

121While there is a foundation for other opinions which Mr Borenstein expressed, I can find no basis in the evidence upon which this impression can properly be accepted.

 

122The evidence established that not only was Billy Mack's death the result of a terrible, fatal wound inflicted by the offender with a knife from behind, it was inflicted during an attack by a number of people, some of whom were restraining him. His attackers inflicted other serious knife wounds. Other terrible injuries were inflicted when he was hit repeatedly with a metal chair frame. The offender's persisting claim, in the face of the evidence, that he acted alone and in self defence, not intending to inflict any harm, is entirely inconsistent with him being genuinely remorseful for either the fatal wound which he admits inflicting, or the other serious injuries which Billy Mack suffered during the attack in which he participated.

 

123That the offender is sorry that Billy Mack is dead may well be accepted, given the consequences which he now faces from the death which he caused. That he is remorseful for his offence is a different matter. That has not been established.

 

124The evidence established that the circumstances of Billy Mack's death were truly awful. His final moments of life, when he was screaming to be released, were filled with pain and terror. The offender has shown no true remorse for his offence and must be sentenced accordingly.

 

125It is settled that in order for it to be established that an offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, it is not necessary that the offender acknowledge his guilt and that offenders found guilty after a trial are not all but automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation unless they then acknowledge their guilt (see Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65]). The difficulty in this case is the evidence of the steps pursued by the offender and other members of his family, not only to shield the others involved with him from detection, but also to protect him from conviction and punishment. While the latter failed, the former is still pursued. In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that the offender has established that he does have good prospects of rehabilitation and that he will not offend again.

 

126His conduct involves more than failing to accept his guilt for his offence, or to feel remorse for what he has done. He continues an active pursuit of steps taken to protect others responsible for Billy Mack's death from detection and punishment for their crime.

 

127In these circumstances, it must be concluded that these mitigating matters have not been established.

 

Deterrence

 

128It is unquestionable in the circumstances which I have discussed that both general and specific deterrence have a significant role to play in the sentence imposed on this offender.

 

The offender's personal circumstances

 

129Consideration must also be given to the evidence of the offender's personal circumstances, disclosed by Mr Borenstein's report and by a number of references which attested to his past, his prior good character and his remorse.

 

130The offender is experiencing the psychological consequences of what he did to Billy Mack. After he was released on bail he was diagnosed to be suffering from depression and anxiety. He regularly consulted his family doctor, but not a psychologist. He described the symptoms which he suffered, to include pain and heaviness in his chest, heart palpitations, low mood and depressed appetite.

 

131He reported working hard while on bail and finishing his apprenticeship. He socialised only with relatives and attended church and became socially withdrawn. He is now a regular church goer. In custody he has been performing work which he wishes to pursue.

 

132He continues to suffer sleep disturbance, worsening depression and anxiety, and suffers panic attacks, for which he is receiving treatment. He is scheduled to see a psychiatrist.

 

133The offender is unmarried and has no partner. He lived at home prior to this offence and had no history of violence or aggression or psychiatric or psychological disturbance. He consumed alcohol socially, did not take illicit drugs and did not smoke. He was in excellent health prior to the offence. There was little family history of psychiatric disorder.

 

134The offender has five brothers and a sister. His parents, who were born in Lebanon, had their children in Australia, where they were raised. He described a close knit family and good childhood, not marred by any violence. He completed his Higher School Certificate but was not academically ambitious. He had no behavioural problems but was bullied in primary school, where he was the victim of racial taunting, to which he never fought back.

 

135He reported having the ability to make friends, participating in sport and having casual work while at high school. He had never been involved in fighting and only got aggressive on the football field, on which he had suffered a number of injuries, from which he had completely recovered.

 

136Mr Borenstein found no evidence of any serious psychiatric disorder and found the offender cognitively intact. There was nothing to predict his violence and aggression, which the offender still claims to be the result of self defence. There was nothing in his history which indicated him to be overly reactive or to experience problems with anger management. He was diagnosed to be suffering an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood consistent with the events which led him to be charged and convicted of murder.

 

Special circumstances

 

137The offender sought a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the ordinary statutory ratio established by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

 

138I am satisfied that in this case, the statutory ratio provides an appropriate period of supervision for this offender prior to the expiration of his sentence, given the non-parole period to be imposed upon him and that his circumstances do not warrant any departure from that ratio.

 

Victim Impact Statement

 

139A victim impact statement by Billy Mack's father was tendered without objection at the sentencing hearing. Mr Mack there described Billy Mack's troubled life and the ongoing, painful impact of his death upon him, Billy Mack's siblings and his nieces and nephews.

 

140From what I have said about the awful circumstances of Billy Mack's death, it is obvious that what is said by the Court in these remarks can give little comfort to his family and friends.

 

141I do hope, however, that these remarks will help them all gain some peace of mind and an understanding of what the evidence has revealed about how Billy Mack came to be murdered and how our society and its criminal justice system has to this point dealt with this awful crime.

 

142For my own part, I extend to all of his family and friends, my very deepest sympathy for his death, the loss which they have suffered and the difficult, ongoing impact which that has upon them.

 

The sentence

 

143The parties agreed that the sentence imposed must commence 30 days before his conviction on 13 November 2013, to reflect the time the offender has already spent in custody. The sentence will thus commence on 14 October 2013.

 

144I have considered all of the matters I have mentioned and have concluded that the offender must be sentenced to a term of 29 years imprisonment for this offence. The application of the statutory ratio results in a non-parole period of 21 years, 9 months and a balance of term of 7 years, 3 months. This means that the earliest date that the offender will be eligible for release is 14 July 2035. That will depend on him convincing the Parole Authority that he should be then released on parole. The sentence will expire on 13 October 2042.

 

145It is finally also necessary to mention the effect of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, which applies to ""serious violence offences"", which include the offence of murder (see s 5A). The effect of this Act is that the State can apply to the Supreme Court for an order that the offender continue to receive supervision or remain in detention (see s 5E). If the Court is then satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that the offender would be a ""high risk offender"", that is an offender who poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if not kept under supervision, it may make an order for extended supervision (see s 5F). An order for continuing detention may be made if the Court is then satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order (see s 5G).

 

Orders

 

146Michael Hadchiti you are convicted of the murder of Billy Mack.

 

147You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 years, 9 months commencing on 14 October 2013 and expiring on 13 July 2035. I set a balance of term of 7 years, 3 months, which is to commence on 14 July 2035 and to expire on 13 October 2042. The earliest date that you will be eligible for release on parole is 13 July 2035. Your sentence will expire on 13 October 2042.

		28 August 2017",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763463,R v Kim [2014] NSWDC 358,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Dongwook Kim, appears today for sentence in relation to two offences with two other offences to be taken into account on a Form 1.
	
	
	The principal offence alleged against the prisoner contrary to s 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 that he on 21 December 2012 at Lidcombe in the State of New South Wales entered the dwelling house of Shin Young Ha situated at 66 Bombay Street, Lidcombe, with intent to commit a serious indictable offence therein, to wit intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation, to wit he was in company with another person, namely Sangrack Kim and Jaehyuk Kim. This offence, to which the prisoner pleaded guilty at the Local Court and was committed for sentence to this Court, is an offence that carries the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and has no standard non parole period.
	
	
	The second offence for which the prisoner is to be sentenced is an offence alleging that the prisoner, on the same date at the same place in the context of the commission of the earlier offence that I mentioned, intimidated Emanuel Ha with the intention of causing him to fear physical or mental harm.
	
	
	The two offences on the Form 1 are, like the second offence for which the prisoner is to be sentenced, offences that are intimately tied up in the commission of the principal offence. One offence is an offence of intimidation with intent to cause fear to Jonathon Ha, the brother of Emanuel Ha and the son of the intended victim of the principal offence committed on the same date and at the same place, and a rather poorly particularised offence of damaging property committed at the same time contrary to s195(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.
	
	
	The prisoner had no prior criminal convictions. He was arrested on 21 December 2012 but spent no time in custody. What is of particular significance in this matter is that one of the co-accused in relation to these offences and who pleaded guilty to the same charges and who had the same matters taken into account on a Form 1, Jaehyuk Kim, who I will refer to hereinafter as Jaehyuk, was dealt with by Judge Williams at Parramatta District Court on 8 November 2013. He was sentenced by his Honour by imposing what he described, without any particulars, as an aggregate sentence purportedly pursuant to the relevant provision of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to a term of two years imprisonment suspended pursuant to s 12.
	
	
	This is a matter where of course parity or disparity, if appropriate, looms very large for reasons which will be explained by reference to the material before me in this sentencing procedure.
	
	
	The material I have relevant to the objective facts is an agreed statement of facts relating to this prisoner, the statement of facts that were tendered in respect of the co-accused and remarks on sentence in relation to the sentencing of Jaehyuk that I have earlier referred to, and of course, naturally, I have read all that material. I also have a pre-sentence report which I will deal with in a moment. I have some evidence from the prisoner and some character references.
	
	
	In relation to the facts of the matter, I do not propose to read in detail what is the agreed facts tendered in the matter but I believe I can do justice to them by summarising the effect of them and to also point to what might be described as points or particular points of difference between this prisoner and the co-accused.
	
	
	The prisoner was a friend of Jaehyuk and Sangrack. The man Jaehyuk Kim was an employee of the intended victim of the principal offence, Shin Young Ha. Shin Young Ha had two children living at his home at 66 Bombay Street, Lidcombe, Jonathon Ha and Emanuel Ha. Jonathon was aged ten, Emanuel was aged 12. Emanuel of course is the victim of the other offence for sentence, Jonathon is the victim of the offence on the Form 1.
	
	
	Mr Ha owns a tiling business for which Mr Jaehyuk Kim did some work. They had, what would appear to be on the agreed facts, an ongoing commercial dispute as to whether Jaehyuk was being adequately remunerated for the work that he was doing. Amongst other things, Jaehyuk drove Mr Ha’s work van from time to time collecting workers, going to worksites and the like. It would appear on the agreed facts that on 20 December the offender Jaehyuk Kim had taken the work van, for reasons not explained fully, without the consent of Mr Ha, or at least that is what Mr Ha has asserted. They had contact on the morning of 21 December and had a series of arguments, it would appear, or an argument at least, after Mr Ha had endeavoured to contact Jaehyuk for some period of time.
	
	
	Mr Ha returned home on 21 December at about 8pm that night and remained for a short period of time and then went off to church. He left his two children in the care of a person named Gui Rim Kim, a boarder at his premises. There was also another boarder at his premises as well. The mother of the children apparently was in the United States.
	
	
	In the meantime, as I understand the evidence and this was also the case conducted by Jaehyuk in front of Judge Williams, Jaehyuk, Sangrack and this prisoner engaged in drinking a quantity of Korean liquor which clearly left them quite intoxicated. In fact the facts reveal that on their arrest, only minutes after the commission of the principal offence, the offenders, including this prisoner, were so intoxicated they could not be read their rights under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002.
	
	
	I am not for a moment suggesting, of course, intoxication is a mitigating factor. But it would seem in this intoxicated state, dealing with this prisoner by himself, that he was inveigled by his friends to attend with them to confront Mr Ha in relation to Jaehyuk’s commercial dispute.
	
	
	The three of them arrived at the premises to find Mr Ha was not there but to find the two young boys were there. As I understand it, all relevant conversations occurred in the Korean language. All relevant people that I have outlined thus far are of Korean background. It is interesting to note in the facts that at one point, when a neighbour intervened, Jaehyuk said of Mr Ha “the guy is supposed to pay us but he hadn’t paid us, he isn’t answering his phone so we we’ve come by to meet him”.
	
	
	After this involvement with a neighbour, young Emanuel opened the door. Jaehyuk was recognised immediately. He was quizzed as to where his mother and father were, there was swearing. At this point the prisoner said to Sangrack Kim “he’s not here, so let’s go”. But Sangrack Kim replied “no, let’s stay, let’s just stay here until he comes”. Naturally, it would appear the three men were in an aggressive frame of mind and being intoxicated, of course, would have compounded the impression they set upon the young children. The young children became fearful of the three men. They opened the door on command. One of them was commanded to call his father. I note, however, that although both young men were intimidated, and there is no issue as to that, it is quite clear on the facts available to me that nobody amongst the three intended these young victims any specific injury. In fact at particular points the facts reveal that, for example, Sangrack Kim told Emanuel and Jonathon to “go upstairs, it doesn’t matter, even if the police come you need not be worried”, and later on, after some furniture had been knocked around and pushed over in the lounge room by the three offenders, Jaehyuk Kim said to the boy Jonathon “it’s going to be all right, don’t worry, it’s nothing to do with you, just go up to your room and stay put”.
	
	
	The boarder, who was in the shower, was a young woman and she was too fearful to come out of the bathroom presumably because of the noise and racket being made.
	
	
	Eventually Mr Ha did arrived back home. Jaehyuk Kim and Sangrack Kim exited the premises and approached Mr Ha’s vehicle. I note in this regard that they took the lead in confronting Ha and it is quite clear, as the facts otherwise reveal, that this commercial dispute was not one in which the prisoner was involved. Nor can it be fairly said that when one analyses the facts the prisoner took a leading role in so far as seeking to confront Mr Ha albeit in circumstances where he was not home.
	
	
	The prisoner did follow Sangrack and Jaehyuk to Ha’s vehicle. There was an incident where Sangrack slapped the bonnet of Mr Ha’s car with his hand. The prisoner and Jaehyuk did not touch the car.
	
	
	Then police arrived. The offenders tried to flee the scene but were arrested, Jaehyuk at the premises or just outside the premises, Sangrack and Dongwook a short distance away.
	
	
	The truth of the matter is, as the agreed facts reveal, the prisoner was part of a joint criminal enterprise to commit the three offences, of that there can be no doubt having regard to all the matters, and thus he is equally culpable in a legal sense as the three other offenders. On the other hand, of course, the issue of moral culpability is not necessarily measured by the extent in which the three offenders are equally legally culpable for the crimes that they committed.
	
	
	As I said earlier, the agreed facts suggest that this prisoner did not take a leading role. It is interesting to note that although the offender gets mentioned throughout the agreed facts, nothing is actually attributed to him as having been particularly said by him about contacting Ha, speaking to the boys or anything of the sort, other than the statement he made when discovering that Ha was not home that the three of them should leave, which was the only piece of commonsense exercised on this night. But, unfortunately, his suggestion that they leave was not taken up.
	
	
	In relation to the man Jaehyuk I have read the remarks on sentence and the statements of facts, so I have noted what was pointed out to me in the course of submissions as to some differences between the agreed facts. Those differences are not adverse to this particular prisoner. I note Judge Williams’ analysis that he thought that Jaehyuk may have played a lesser role. I have a great deal of difficulty seeing that, on either version of the agreed facts, and certainly it is clear on the agreed facts available to me that this prisoner’s moral culpability can be clearly described as lesser than the two co-accused.
	
	
	I am appreciative of the fact, of course, that if it was the case that the prisoner was a hireling that had been brought to this commercial dispute as an enforcer even though he had no particular interest in it, that would be a matter of factual aggravation putting aside anything that might be gleaned from s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. But it seems that this prisoner was merely an acquaintance or friend or workmate of these other two offenders, he had no commercial interest in the matter, he was to gain nothing from his involvement. He did it out of loyalty and a degree of intoxication and it is clear, when one has regard to the character evidence and the absence of criminal convictions and the other material available to me, that this conduct on the part of the prisoner was entirely uncharacteristic. Of course, one of the matters I am not aware of, and it was not a matter particularly explored when the prisoner gave evidence but needs to be noted, is I am unaware of precisely what the prisoner had been told by the co-accused about the character of the dispute with Mr Ha. To that extent he was somewhat captive to hearsay representations because, as I said earlier, it was Jaehyuk’s dispute, not his.
	
	
	In the context of having no criminal convictions I note that the prisoner is 34 years of age, as I understand it. He was born and raised in Korea. He first came to Sydney in 2002 on a working holiday visa. He returned to Korea for a short time and then was granted a student visa, somewhat surprisingly one would have thought at the age of 30, which permitted him to come back to Australia for a period of some years. Unfortunately, he has not been able to pursue his studies and has essentially, as I understand it, been working in casual cash type employment in the building industry and elsewhere similar to the work undertaken by Jaehyuk Kim particularly.
	
	
	Latest enquiries by the Probation and Parole Service reveal that the prisoner, as at 13 February 2014, was on a bridging visa awaiting the decision of the review tribunal in regards to the issue of whether his visa should be cancelled. As I understand it, the prisoner would seek residential status in Australia.
	
	
	He comes from a somewhat deprived financial background in the sense that his father had been unwell for many years, he told the Probation and Parole Service. His mother had worked very hard to support him and his younger sister. His father had then passed away eight years ago and his mother and sister continued to support him, he claimed.
	
	
	He has had an eclectic career. He completed the equivalent of Year 12 in Korea. He did a two year fashion design course. He has undertaken military service for two and a half years in Korea. He has been offered a position to complete a Diploma of Business at what is called a “registered training organisation” in western Sydney, but due to current financial stresses he has been unable to take up these offers. In relation to his current employer he has been working part-time for that employer since March 2013 and is described as punctual and hardworking.
	
	
	He referred to his use of alcohol on the night but did not have a particular difficulty with alcohol, being a social drinker, and there is no suggestion of drug or alcohol abuse.
	
	
	There is in this matter absolutely no connotation of gang connections an the like that sometimes are intimately concerned with commercial disputes of this type. So, I hasten to say, there is absolutely no suggestion the prisoner was hired as some enforcer. In fact, looking at him, his physical appearance does not present as a person who is prone to enforcement activities or violence. He no longer associates with his co accused.
	
	
	He expressed regret for his behaviour. He said he had little recollection of the relevant events. He accepted that his intoxication did not excuse his behaviour and the Probation and Parole Service said that he expressed “a level of shame in regard to his behaviour and also demonstrated insight into the negative impact his offending would have had on the victims”.
	
	
	The assessment of him is that he has had generally a stable life in Australia. He has identified alcohol as a factor that contributed to his offending behaviour but he does not present with any past or present issues, and he presents with good insight into his offending and the conduct of his companions and is willing to accept the consequences of his behaviour. He is suitable for community service but unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision by Community Corrections.
	
	
	He gave evidence before me about the consumption of alcohol the night before. He expressed his desire to live in Australia but is concerned about the effect upon his residency by his conviction and expressed regret for his conduct and expressed his contrition in his evidence and took responsibility for his conduct.
	
	
	I also have other material. I have references speaking of the prisoner’s good character, his loyalty, his assistance to others, his support for his family, for his professionalism and his work and the fact that he is not a person prone to violent behaviour is the effect of those references. One referee, also known by the surname or family name of Kim, said that during the five years that that person had known him he had never harmed anybody and the disclosure of these allegations made that person sad. He has expressed regret to his referees. I have taken that material into account.
	
	
	I also have a letter addressed to the prisoner’s solicitors dated 11 March from a firm of lawyers who are purported ‘Immigration Specialists’. It sets out the details relating to the prisoner’s background and his various applications for visas and the like.
	
	
	That document sets out some information relating to the issue of desire of the prisoner to seek a more permanent residency in Australia, of the application of s 501 Migration Act 1958, the Commonwealth legislation relating to the issuing of residency, citizenship and other visas. It provides in that section that the Minister or his delegate may refuse a visa application made by a non citizen if a person has not passed the character test, and I do not propose to go through an in-depth distillation of what is contained within the advice that the prisoner’s instructing solicitors have received. But the legislation provides that a person will automatically fail the character test for the balance of their entire life if they have a substantial criminal history or record. A substantial criminal record may involve a non-citizen who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, a non-citizen who has been sentenced to two or more terms of imprisonment where the total of the terms is two years or more. In determining the length of the sentence under the character test it is only the term sentenced and not the term served which is relevant. That remains the case even if the term is fully suspended and the person does not serve any time in gaol at all.
	
	
	I note in relation to the definition of imprisonment, as footnoted in the letter, it included “any form of punitive detention in a facility or institution”, (see s 501(12) Migration Act 1958), and there are other footnotes that provide some information.
	
	
	It is expressed in the opinion of the immigration specialist that any term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, including a suspended sentence, would lead Mr Kim permanently to fail the character test. These are matters, of course, that are discretionary matters within the thrall of the minister considering all relevant matters.
	
	
	In this matter of course parity or disparity, if appropriate with the sentence imposed upon the co-accused, is a critical matter. I note the “aggregate” sentence imposed in relation to the co accused by Judge Williams, again I point out he provided no particulars as to how he arrived at that particular aggregate.
	
	
	In my view there is a need for a distinction between this prisoner and the co-accused in respect of the principal offence. There are several reasons, although the subject circumstances were largely very similar.
	
	
	Firstly, this prisoner may be distinguished from the co-accused, in an assessment of the objective facts, as being less culpable in the way I have identified. He sought actually to bring the matter to an end before things got out of hand, so to speak, but his request that they leave was turned down by his more enthusiastic co-accused.
	
	
	Secondly, it is clear that he did not suggest this course of action. It was clear that the actions of his co-accused were of a more leading role compared to him.
	
	
	Another matter of relevance was this question that was raised with me of the potential for extra-curial punishment, the extra-curial punishment being the consequences of a conviction by the application of the character test under the Migration Act. In fairness, the learned Crown Prosecutor said the matter as it was articulated by learned counsel for the prisoner was not relevant to the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	My initial feeling was that what was identified within the advice from the immigration lawyers cannot be fairly described as “extra-curial punishment”.
	
	
	I have, however, reconsidered the matter in light of the decision of Ahio v DPP [2008] NSWSC 565, a decision of Justice Hislop delivered on 6 May 2008. There his Honour was considering the issue of whether the magistrate had erred in law in failing to take into account, in fixing an appropriate penalty for the offender, the fact that the plaintiff’s security licence was automatically revoked as a consequence of his conviction of the subject offence.
	
	
	Having regard to the resolution of the matter by his Honour and noting some of the authorities to which his Honour referred, particularly a case that I described as Diaz in submissions but in fact is cited correctly in this judgment as Daetz (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 particularly at [62], I have come to the conclusion that the potential for assessment of the matter by the Minister could fairly be described as extra-curial punishment. To be frank, however, it is not a matter that is of great significance but certainly I could not conclude that it was irrelevant in the decision-making process in distinguishing this prisoner from the co-accused. The co-accused apparently was due to return to Korea following the sentencing and the issue of extra-curial punishment in the way in which it is raised in this matter was not raised before Judge Williams as a relevant matter. 
	
	
	In Daetz the Court of Criminal Appeal held:
	


“In sentencing the offender the Court takes into account what extra curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the Court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra-curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case”.


	
	Likewise, in the guideline judgment in relation to high range PCA matters reported at (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 Justice Howie noted, inter alia, that licence disqualification, which is of course as we know on conviction for a PCA offence an automatic or mandatory consequence, is
	


“Such a significant matter and can have such a devastating effect upon a person’s ability to derive income and to function appropriately within the committee that it is a matter which, in my view, must be taken into account by a court when determining what the consequences should be, both penal and otherwise, for a particular offence committed by a particular offender”.


	
	And earlier in that same paragraph his Honour noted:
	


“Generally, when sentencing for a criminal offence, a court is entitled to consider all the consequences to the offender arising from the commission of that offence in determining what penalty to impose. Extra-curial punishments are routinely taken into account by sentencing courts and it would be unjust to do otherwise:.


	
	Turning of course then to the issue of parity, of course parity of sentencing is one where the courts are not required in sentencing co offenders to impose the same sentence simply because the offenders commit the same offence. The matter is succinctly discussed by the High Court in the judgment of Justices Gaudron and Dawson in Postiglione v R and has recently been discussed at length in the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment of Jimmy from 2010, both Justice Rothman and Justice Campbell, as well as I hasten to say Justice Howie, in three separate judgments discussed the matter at length.
	
	
	To paraphrase the more eloquent words of Justice Rothman, parity of sentencing is merely another fact of equality of treatment of offenders and of equality before the law, it is an extension of what is described by his Honour as Aristotelian principles of equality, alike shall be treated alike and the unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness.
	
	
	In this matter, analysing it as closely as I can, even allowing for the very similar subjective circumstances there is an unlikeness between this prisoner and his co-accused. There is, first of all, the lesser moral culpability of the prisoner, if I might describe it as that, and also, on any analysis of the agreed facts, a lesser role in the perpetration of the joint criminal enterprise for which he was responsible and there is the added issue of the potential for extra curial punishment. There is also the material within the pre-sentence report, although as I said subjectively this prisoner is not much different from the co accused already deal with.
	
	
	In this regard I point out, of course, that in determining that there should be some distinction between this prisoner and the co-accused, the distinction should not be so great as to leave in the mind of Jaehyuk Kim a sense of justifiable grievance. Hence, in the circumstances of the matter, all things considered, it is clear, notwithstanding s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that a term of imprisonment must be imposed in respect of the principal offence.
	
	
	Of course, in sentencing for the principal offence, I take into account the guideline judgment relating to Form 1 matters from 2002 and particularly the observations of the learned Chief Justice of the Court, Chief Justice Spigelman, between paras 18 and 43 where he talked about the need to give proper weight to the matters on a Form 1 sometimes leading to a greater penalty than otherwise would be required for the principal offence without the Court having to necessarily analyse the extent to which the principal offence penalty has been increased. In certain circumstances matters on a Form 1 will point to greater need for personal deterrence and the need for punishment and the entitlement of the community to extract retribution.
	
	
	That having been said, as I have earlier pointed out the Form 1 matters in this affair by relationship to the principal offence are intimately bound up with the facts of the principal offence, they very much fall from the circumstances of the commission of the principal offence. This is not a situation where one is sentencing an offender, for example, for an armed robbery and having to take into account two or three quite separate armed robberies into account on a Form 1 where the penalty ultimately to be imposed for the principal offence would be, one would have thought, substantially increased in those circumstances.
	
	
	In the context of dealing with this matter I have certainly had close regard to what their Honours said in the guideline judgment. I am, obviously, also required to have regard to the terms of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and in the context of the need for some element of general and personal deterrence again I conclude that it is appropriate to impose a term of imprisonment of the length I have considered appropriate for the principal offence.
	
	
	Likewise, in relation to the other offence for sentencing but in the context of the criminality relating to the principal offence, the second offence can be seen as very collateral to the commission of the principal offence.
	
	
	I am required, of course, to have regard to s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which I have. There are no specific aggravating factors arising particularly under s 21A(2) that I need to consider, none have been specifically addressed upon and all relevant aggravating factors have been identified from the facts as I have outlined them.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating matters, there are many. The offences that I am required to sentence the prisoner were certainly not planned offences, nor offences committed in the context of organised criminal activity. The prisoner was a person of good character. The prisoner has no prior convictions. The prisoner has excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	In my view the prisoner is unlikely to re-offence, I believe his experience in this matter is a salutary experience. He has shown remorse and taken responsibility for his actions, and of course his plea of guilty to each offence is a mitigating factor. For each plea he receives, as I earlier indicated where appropriate, a discount of 25%.
	
	
	The sentencing of the offender however, as I have earlier pointed out, in all the circumstances still requires, as I have reasoned, the imposition of a term of imprisonment but suspended in the context of the reasoning of Justice Howie in the decision of Zamagias. Thus, in respect of the offences to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty I make the following orders.
	
	
	In respect of the principal offence - you can stand up, sir - which is sequence 1 in the sequence of offences, that is the enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation, the offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 12 months. That term of imprisonment is suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	


Conditions of the bond that he will be required to enter are that:

(1) he is to be of good behaviour;

(2) he is to appear before court if required to do so or called upon to do so;

(3) he is to advise the registrar of the criminal listing directorate or the District Court criminal registry of any change of residential address.


	
	I do not propose to fix any requirements for supervision.
	
	
	In respect of the other offence, the offence of intimidation, my view of that matter is that the prisoner should be convicted on him entering into a bond pursuant to s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for two years. Thus his freedom will be restrained for that period on the same conditions as I fixed for the suspended sentence, that is that he be of good behaviour, he appear in court if required to do so for sentence and that he advise the Court of any change of residential address.
	
	
	In fixing the sentence for the principal offence, as I earlier have said, I have taken into account the two matters on the Form 1.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You will be required to go to level 4 to enter into the bond, Mr Kim, and I’m sure the Minister for Immigration will take into account my remarks on sentence. I hasten to say I want you to clearly understand, however, that whilst taking into account the potential action of the minister, a court cannot structure its sentence merely to accommodate administrative consequences that flow from convictions, although the potential for some administrative action or ministerial action is as I have said still relevant in the sentencing procedure.

		23 October 2015",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763471,R v Abdallah; In the matter of John Leger [2014] NSWSC 320,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1I am sentencing John Leger for the offence of contempt in the face of the Court to which he has pleaded guilty.
2This procedure is a summary hearing of the charge which was laid by me on 17 of February 2014. 
3In those circumstances the Attorney General has approved the appointment of Ms Baker, a solicitor advocate employed by the Crown Solicitor's office, as amicus curiae to assist the Court in the proceedings. Mr Clark of counsel appears for Mr Leger.  The facts constituting the offence are not in dispute.
4The terms of the charge to which Mr Leger has pleaded guilty are of being in contempt of the Supreme Court of the New South Wales arising out of his unlawful refusal to answer questions asked of him in the trial of R v Abdallah.  In the following recitation of the relevant facts I have drawn upon the excellent written submissions prepared by Ms Baker.
5The Crown case at the trial was that Mr Abdallah shot Neal Todorovski six times with a handgun at about midday on 4 January 2012 in a residential street in Sans Souci.
6That shooting, on the evidence that I heard as trial judge, was part of a continuum of events that included an allegation that after shooting Mr Todorovski at least three times, and possibly six at that time, Mr Abdallah gave chase to Mr Leger, an associate of Mr Todorovski's and in the course of that chase discharged his firearm.
7The trial before me and a jury of 12 concluded on 17 March 2014 by the jury returning a verdict of guilty of the murder of Neal Todorovski but not guilty of the attempted murder of Mr Leger. The latter offence was allegedly constituted by the pursuit I described.  The Crown case was that Mr Abdallah had discharged the pistol at Mr Leger with the intention of shooting and killing him. In the absence of the evidence of Mr Leger the Crown case in that regard was, at least in my assessment, entirely circumstantial.
8Mr Leger, as I said, was an associate of Mr Todorovski present at the time he was murdered. He, however, at all times thereafter, declined in any way to provide any information to the investigating police officers.  He refused to give evidence at the committal and was subpoenaed to give evidence at the trial.
9He was called as a Crown witness on 17 of February 2014.  That was in the context of a Basha inquiry carried out for the purpose of ascertaining what evidence Mr Leger could give in the trial if called as a Crown witness. Those ancillary proceedings are for the purpose of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) part of the trial.   When he was called the following occurred: 

CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q.  Please state your full name, witness?
A.  John Leger.
Q.  Mr Leger, you have been called to assist this enquiry in respect to events on 4 January 2012 at Sans Souci, do you understand that?
A.  (No verbal reply.)

HIS HONOUR
Q.  Mr Leger, are you going to answer counsel's question?
A.  Don't recall, your Honour.

CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q.  Now you have uttered the words, ""I don't recall"", to what do you refer when you say you don't recall?  Where is this memory problem?

CLARK:  I object.  Could it be a little bit more specific than that?

CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q.  You were at Sans Souci on 4 January 2012?
A.  I don't recall.
Q.  You don't recall, can you recall where you were on that date?
A.  No answer.
Q.  Let me ask you a simple question, do you know Neal Todorovski?
A.  (No verbal reply).
Q.  Do you know him?
A.  (No verbal reply).
HIS HONOUR:  Mr Crown, perhaps if I could intervene? 
Q.  Mr Leger you have been called and you have made a solemn promise to tell the truth and during the time that you have been asked questions by the Crown about matters which people who knew about them might think were very memorable matters you have either said 'I don't recall' or you have sat silently and not answered the questions.  Are you refusing to answer the questions that have been asked of you?
A.  Don't recall, your Honour.
Q.  No sir, please listen to my question, because it doesn't require you to cast back in your memory to answer it.  Are you refusing to answer the questions that the Crown has asked you?
A.  Your Honour I don't remember.
Q.  You understand, don't you sir, that it is of fundamental importance that witnesses who are called for the purpose of criminal proceedings give evidence according to the best of their recollection.  You understand that, don't you?
A.  (No verbal reply).
Q.  You have to answer verbally yes or no?
A.  (No verbal reply).
HIS HONOUR:  The witness is again sitting silently."" 
10Thereafter there was a discussion between me and Mr Clark of counsel, who appeared also on that occasion for Mr Leger, concerning Mr Leger's silence and the reasons for that silence.  The following exchange then took place:HIS HONOUR
Q.  Yes Mr Leger you were present when a person shot Mr Todorovski?
A.  I don't recall, your Honour, I don't remember.
Q.  Did the same person who shot Mr Todorovski chase you down the driveway and discharge a gun at you?
A.  I don't remember.
Q.  Did the police speak to you about those circumstances on the day they happened?
A.  I don't remember, your Honour.
Q.  You understand, do you not, that you have been required to attend court today in order to give evidence at a criminal trial.  That is so, isn't it?
A.  Yes, your Honour.
Q.  Did you say yes to that question?
A.  I said, yes, your Honour.
Q.  And are you refusing, Mr Leger, to give evidence in that criminal trial?
A.  (No verbal reply).
Q.  Mr Leger, I must require you to answer my question, are you refusing to give evidence in the criminal trial?
A.  Yes, your Honour.
11I then asked Mr Leger whether he had had the opportunity to take legal advice from his counsel about the requirement that he give evidence.  He confirmed that he had.  He also confirmed that he understood the court's powers in dealing with a person for contempt of court included a power to impose a fine, a sentence of imprisonment or both. 
12After the contemnor was granted a short adjournment to speak to his counsel the contemnor was asked whether he was now prepared to answer such questions ""as may be asked of you in these proceedings"".  He said ""No, your Honour"".
13After further argument I again warned Mr Leger that a refusal to answer questions could lead to a charge of contempt of court.  He still adhered to his refusal to answer the questions and I laid the charge that I have read out at the commencement of these reasons. 
14On the application of Mr Clark, on behalf of Mr Leger, I did not require a plea to be entered to the charge at that time but committed Mr Leger to custody until the conclusion of the trial with bail refused. 
15As I have said on 17 March 2014 Mr Abdallah was found guilty of the murder of Mr Todorovski and not guilty of the attempted murder of Mr Leger. 
16I should say that during the course of the trial, on Friday  28 February 2014 Mr Leger, represented by Mr Clark, appeared before me via audio-visual link. The purpose of that appearance was to give Mr Leger the opportunity to reconsider his position and to agree to give evidence and to answer questions required of him in the proceedings. In the light of his plea of guilty, entered formally today, I think I can put it that he was given the opportunity of purging his contempt.  He declined that opportunity. 
17Contempt of court is, of course, considered by the law to be a very serious offence.  I have had the benefit of careful argument from both Mr Clark and Ms Baker and I have been carefully taken through the analysis of the offence of contempt in the face of the court undertaken by Buddin J in Principal Registrar of Supreme Court of NSW v Thanh Vu Tran [2006] NSWSC 1183 and the further analysis undertaken by Johnson J in R v Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366; 166 A Crim R 132. 
18It is unnecessary for me to fully rehearse the learning that their Honours brought to bear upon this topic for this decision.  Suffice it to say that in Registrar of the Court Of Appeal v Raad (unreported NSWCA No.  40585/1991, 9/6/92), Kirby P, as his Honour then was, said:
The refusal to answer questions which are relevant and admissible strikes at the very way in which justice is done in the courts of this country. It undermines the rule of law observed in our society . As this Court said in Gilby, the refusal to be sworn, or once sworn to give evidence, is a failure to discharge the obligation which the person owes as a member of the community or because he or she is within it. It is a concomitant of a society ruled by law and not by brute force that a person competent to do so should, where required, be sworn or affirmed to give truthful evidence and that he or she should give evidence when called upon to do so in the courts in answer to questions lawfully addressed.
19In Smith v The Queen (1991) 25 NSWLR 1, his Honour, having reviewed these important principles, also said at 10:
[There] are good reasons for adhering to the rule that to refuse to be sworn (or to affirm) or to give evidence such as occurred here amounts to a serious contempt in the face of the court. It is serious because courts decide cases on the basis of evidence. If evidence is unjustifiably withheld, the administration of justice is impeded
20In the same case Mahoney J observed at 23:
Conduct of this kind will not be deterred by admonition or by gesture.  It is necessary that the punishment for it be direct, immediate and exemplary.
21So far as the offender's circumstances are concerned I am informed by Mr Clark that he lives in Manly with his defacto wife and one child and is usually gainfully employed in demolition work. 
22Moreover, at the very outset of these proceedings today, Mr Clark in the most eloquent terms, proffered on his client's behalf an unreserved apology for the contempt which Mr Leger now admits. 
23As I have said Mr Leger has pleaded guilty to the charge and he has done so at what is effectively the first opportunity available to him.  The plea was entered today.  However I should record, as Mr Clark reminded me, that when this matter was mentioned at various times during the currency of the trial of R v Abdallah counsel indicated that his instructions were such that when the trial was over his client would plead guilty to the offence. 
24Further a good deal of evidence has been tendered before me which suggests that as a result of his involvement in the events of 4 January 2012, in particular because he was present when Todorovski was murdered and he himself was at that time under threat from a gunman, he has suffered a degree of post-traumatic stress disorder. On the balance of probabilities I am persuaded that this condition continues to be symptomatic to some extent.  In making this finding I accept the evidence of Dr Nielssen expressed in his report of 3 September 2013 (exhibit 1), the opinion of Dr Lachter, expressed in his report of 12 July 2012 (exhibit 2), and also the opinion of Miss Rosalind Dayman, a registered psychologist, in her report of 19 April 2013 (exhibit 4).  I add that it may be that Miss Dayman is not fully qualified to express an opinion as to diagnosis but, given the opinions of the legally qualified medical practitioners, her account of the treatment that she rendered assisted me in making the finding that I have recorded. 
25It is also clear that he first sought treatment for that condition on the 28 February 2012, within six weeks of the murder of Todorovski, and that he received treatment, as I have said from Miss Dayman.  He also received treatment in July 2012 for a short time as an inpatient at South Pacific Private Hospital. Then he underwent about five weeks of outpatient treatment at that institution following his discharge.  Having said that, it is convenient to interpolate at this stage that there is no suggestion that that medical condition. or the co-morbidity of substance abuse diagnosed by Dr Nielssen, in any way affected his memory such that he was unable to give an account of the events of the 4 January 2012 which he witnessed.  Indeed, I think it convenient to record that he was able to give Dr Nielssen a history of the event.  He told the doctor that he witnessed the murder of a close friend in early 2012 which left him with marked anxiety and intrusive images of the incident.  He not only witnessed his friend's murder but also narrowly escaped being shot himself. He said he was very affected by frightening images of the experience. 
26It is clear to me beyond reasonable doubt, from reading the report of Dr Nielssen,  that Mr Leger had an actual recollection of the events of the 4 January which would have constituted material evidence at the trial of Abdallah. 
27Whilst dealing with the circumstances of Mr Leger I should also point out that he has been in custody since the 17 February last and I accept Mr Clark's account on his instructions that during that period of time Mr Leger has been held in segregation and, generally speaking, in lockdown for periods of up to 23 hours per day.  I am informed by Mr Clark that this circumstance has come about, at least in part, out of concerns the corrective services authorities may have for Mr Leger's safety in custody. 
28The principles governing the imposition of a sentence for contempt of court are not in dispute between the parties and again are summarised in the written submissions of Ms Baker.  They are derived from previous decisions of this court and in particular from the judgment of Dunford J in Wood v Staunton (No 5) (1996) 86 A Crim R 183 at 185.
29I should say at this point that the offence of contempt in the face of the court is a common law offence and as such it is said that the penalty is at large.  In dealing with such offences courts will often have regard to any available, or near, statutory analogue which might provide a reference point for determining the maximum penalty appropriate to what might be called a worst possible case of the common law offence. I am not suggesting that this is the worst possible case of contempt in the face of the court. 
30 Ms Baker has drawn my attention to various provisions in legislation dealing with commissions of inquiry instituted on behalf of the Executive Government including the ICAC legislation, the Police Integrity legislation and the Royal Commissions Act.  However, I accept her submission that this legislation does not provide any true analogue, given the significant differences between a governmental statutory inquiry and a murder trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.
31However I have been assisted by a table of sentences in broadly similar cases totalling 23 in number.  I bear in mind, however, that past sentences do not provide a range or a tariff as such and only provide guidance to the extent to which principles of general application can be derived from them. 
32I turn then to the relevant factors.  I have already dealt with the seriousness of the contempt proved.  Contempt in the face of the court by reason of a refusal to answer questions in a criminal trial is always regarded as objectively serious. 
33The second consideration is whether the contemnor was aware of the consequences to himself of what he did.  In recounting the facts I have set out what was said to him when he was sworn to give evidence about the consequences of refusing to answer questions.  I have emphasised that he was given an adjournment for the benefit of seeking advice from Mr Clark of counsel and that when he returned to the witness box he adhered to his previous refusal to answer questions. There can be no doubt that Mr Leger was aware of the consequences of his contempt.  
34In terms of the actual consequences of the contempt it is relevant to bear in mind that this question is often determined with the benefit of hindsight.  In this case we know that the absence of Mr Leger's evidence was not a bar to the conviction of Mr Abdallah for murder.  However his evidence might well have been critical in the case of the attempted murder.  Mr Leger was not a legally essential witness for that charge to be made good but he was a vital witness and his absence reduced the Crown case to one based purely on circumstantial evidence, no other witness being able to give a direct eye witness account as to Mr Leger being in the sights of Mr Abdallah at the time Mr Abdallah discharged what may have been the final shot from his gun. 
35Moreover it is significant to bear in mind that the case of Mr Abdallah at the trial was one of self-defence, a case clearly rejected by the jury.  Had Mr Leger given evidence and been subject to cross-examination by senior counsel for Mr Abdallah, his prospects of a possible acquittal, or a reduction in the seriousness of the charge to manslaughter, might have been enhanced. 
36Accordingly, it cannot be said that the consequences of the contempt mattered little to the conduct of the case, even if counsel appearing in the trial reconciled themselves to the idea that Mr Leger would not be available as a witness.
37Mr Clark acknowledges, as he must, that the contempt was committed in the context of a trial for a serious crime.  Murder, after treason, is the most serious crime on the criminal calendar. 
38The fifth consideration is the reason for the contempt.  Mr Clark advanced on behalf of his client the idea that he was scared to give evidence because of possible consequences. I bear in mind my finding that he has suffered, and continues to suffer from a degree of, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder having witnessed his close friend being murdered and himself being threatened by a gun wielded by a man prepared to use it. I accept that those circumstances provide a basis for Mr Clark to argue that I should take into account a subjective apprehension of danger and I am so satisfied on the balance of probabilities. However such a matter falls a long way short of anything constituting duress.  Moreover, in the modern criminal trial, protective measures can be instituted for the safety of a witness who has a legitimate basis for fear and no such approach, or application, was made by Mr Leger. 
39The sixth consideration is whether the contemnor has received any benefit by indicating an intention to give evidence.  That factor is not in play here.  This is not a case where an offender agrees to give evidence for the Crown in exchange for a benefit.  Mr Leger at all times indicated a refusal to make any statement or to give any evidence whatsoever about the facts giving rise to the charges against Mr Abdallah. However I am not so sure that a long history of recalcitrance operates in mitigation. 
40The seventh consideration is whether there has been any apology or contrition.  There has been an apology most eloquently expressed by counsel, which I am prepared to accept.  The early plea not only has a utilitarian value but also might on the balance of probabilities indicate some degree of contrition.  However these matters can only go so far and real contrition in a case like this can readily be shown by a witness purging his contempt during the course of the criminal trial.  That did not occur here.  Moreover the apology was given today at a time when there was no opportunity for Mr Leger to purge his contempt given the return of the jury's verdict yesterday.  I will take the apology into account but it cannot be given very significant weight. 
41I turn then to the eighth consideration, being the character and antecedents of the contemnor.  His criminal record has been tendered on these proceedings as exhibit A.  I accept Mr Clark's submission that it is mostly characterised by the most appalling driving and traffic record. By putting it that way I do not mean to down play the seriousness of such offences. There was a 10 year period between 2000 and 2010 when no offences of any kind were committed. 
42As a juvenile he was dealt with for an assault, an offence which was dismissed with a caution.  He has also been dealt with for using a prohibited weapon, being a set of knuckle dusters, with which he struck Abdallah during the events giving rise to the murder of Todorovski and also common assault, having the same basis. 
43Of even more concern is an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 27 January 2013 which, on the history received by Dr Nielssen, was upon a female within licensed premises at a time when he may have been affected by alcohol.  But, most significantly for my purposes, is at that time he was on bail for the offences with which he was charged arising out of the events of the 4 January. 
44Moreover he was dealt with for those offences on the 12 February 2013 and given a s 9 bond each of 15 months' duration in respect of both of them.  He was also dealt with for the assault charge in the licensed premises with a two year bond under supervision. That sentence was passed on 5 September 2013.  He was also under a s 9 bond of 18 months' duration with supervision for a serious traffic offence.  Accordingly, as at the time he committed the offence of contempt in the face of the court he was on no less than four bonds. The law always regards the commission of an offence whilst the offender is on conditional liberty as a serious aggravating circumstance.  
45I turn then to the final matters which are points 9 and 10 which I will take together. They are bearing in mind deterrence, both general and personal, and denunciation of the contempt.  As Johnson J observed in Razzak at [78]:
General deterrence is a most important factor on sentence in this case. Persons who are called as witnesses in criminal proceedings must understand that significant consequences will flow from a refusal to be sworn or affirmed or to give evidence. If witnesses will not give evidence, the process of law enforcement will be less effective and more people will suffer accordingly. There is a public interest in ensuring that in this regard, disobedience of the law will be, and will be seen to be, punished: Gilby at p 26.
46Those comments apply with equal force to a person who has suffered to be sworn to give evidence but who has refused to answer the questions required to be answered in the trial.  The related consideration of public denunciation of an abject refusal to answer questions in criminal trials must also be brought to bear. 
47Bearing in mind all of these factors and acknowledging that the approach required of a judge in my position, as described by McHugh JA in Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357 is one of intuitive synthesis, I have determined that no other sentence than a term of full-time imprisonment is appropriate in this case.  I have borne firmly in mind Mr Clark's careful arguments about the possible alternatives that may be available by way of non-custodial penalty.  However it seems to me that in all the circumstances as I have described them, and in particular when one has regard to the elements of deterrence and denunciation, that a full-time term of imprisonment is called for by way of punishment. 
48In fixing the appropriate term I have of course borne firmly in mind the early plea of guilty and I have allowed the maximum discount suggested by authority as available in such cases of 25 percent. That will be reflected in the sentence I impose. 
49John Leger, you are convicted of the offence of contempt in the face of the court committed on the 17 February 2014 in the trial of R v Abdallah.  I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months' duration commencing on 17 February 2014 and expiring on 16 August 2014. 
50I make the following additional order on the application of Ms Baker as amicus and with the consent of Mr Clark of counsel on behalf of the offender: the record is amended throughout so that these proceedings are entitled R v Abdallah; In the matter of John Leger.  I strike out any reference to the Prothonotary as the prosecutor in this matter

		24 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763472,R v Abdallah; in the matter of Matthew Edward Lewis [2014] NSWSC 319,"EX TEMPORE Judgment1I am sentencing Matthew Lewis for the offence of contempt in the face of the court, to which he has pleaded guilty.  The terms of the charge laid by me on 17 February 2014 are that he is in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of his wilful refusal to answer questions asked of him in the trial of R v Abdallah when required to do so.  On that day I remanded him in custody, where he has remained ever since. 
2The circumstances giving rise to the charge are fully set out in the written submissions I have received from Ms Baker, solicitor advocate employed in the Office of the Crown Solicitor, who has been appointed amicus curiae by the Attorney General.  I am grateful for the Attorney providing her advocacy. 
3Mr Clark of counsel ably represents Mr Lewis. 
4As the written submissions point out, where the contemnor is charged by the trial judge the matter may proceed without the involvement of a prosecutor.  In such circumstances it may be necessary for counsel to appear as amicus to assist the judge by making appropriate submissions. This is the case in these proceedings. 
5The facts are not in dispute, and in reciting them I rely heavily upon the submissions provided by Ms Baker.  The Crown alleged that Mr Abdallah shot Neal Todorovski a number of times with a handgun at about midday on 4 January 2012 in a residential street in Sans Souci.  There was also a second charge of attempted murder of Mr John Leger, which occurred as part of the same continuum of fact giving rise to the murder charge.  I sentenced Mr Leger for contempt in the face of the court earlier today. 
6Mr Lewis was an associate of Mr Todorovski and of Mr Leger, and was present at the time the shooting occurred.  From the evidence led at Mr Abdallah's trial, it is clear that immediately upon Mr Abdallah producing the gun, Mr Lewis fled.  He fled in a generally south-easterly direction towards the corner of Selmon and Campbell Streets, Sans Souci.  That was a different direction from that taken by Mr Leger who ran generally north along a driveway between two neighbouring blocks of units. Mr Lewis was not then in a position to give any evidence as to the second count, being the attempted murder count. He was in a position to give evidence in relation to the murder count. 
7In any event, after a trial lasting about four weeks, the jury returned yesterday, Monday 17 March 2014, with a verdict of guilty of the murder charge, but not guilty of the attempted murder charge. 
8Mr Lewis was called as a Crown witness on 17 February 2014.  This was by way of a Basha inquiry to ascertain what evidence he could give in the trial proper if called as a Crown witness.  That procedure was necessary because at all times since 4 January 2012 Mr Lewis had refused to provide any statement to the police.  He appeared by counsel at the committal proceedings and was excused from giving evidence there. Before me the following occurred after he was called as a witness by the learned Crown Prosecutor:Q.  Please state your full name?A.  Matt Edward Lewis.
Q.  Mr Lewis, did you know Neal Todorovski?  Did you know Neal Todorovski?A.  Yes.
Q.  You did know him, Neal?A.  Yes, Neal, yes.
Q.  And were you with him on the day he died?A.  No, I don't remember.
Q.  You say you ""don't remember"", what aspect of my enquiry is it you don't remember?A.  I don't remember seeing him.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  (Addressing the court.)  I'm told by Mr Clark the position is the same.  There is no utility.  I'm in your Honour's hands.
HIS HONOUR
Q.  Mr Lewis, as I understand the case that I'm going to hear, Mr Todorovski was gunned down in broad daylight in a residential street in Sans Souci and you are said to be a person who was present at the time.  Now, without prejudging anything, ordinary people hearing you say ""no, I don't remember"", are likely to find that to be so absurd that if you had been present at such an event and didn't remember it, as to be can I say laughable, and that an ordinary person might then conclude that saying ""no I don't remember"" is no more than a device adopted by you for the purpose of avoiding giving evidence in this court.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Do you?A.  Yes.
Q.  Can I ask you this question:  Are you refusing to answer the questions that are required of you in these proceedings?A.  I just answered ""I can't remember"".
Q.  Do you accept you were present?  Do you accept you were present when Neal Todorovski was shot?A.  I don't remember, your Honour.
Q.  Were you a friend of Neal Todorovski's?A.  Yes, your Honour.
Q.  Do you remember being with him on 4 January 2011?A.  I don't remember, your Honour.
Q.  Mr Lewis, is there some reason why you don't want to answer questions?A.  No, your Honour, I'm answering them.
Q.  If you had any fear of reprisals or anything of that nature, the court has powers that would protect your anonymity, do you understand what I mean?A.  I don't know what that word means.
Q.  Sorry, but your identity could be suppressed, do you understand what I mean by that?A.  No, your Honour.
Q.  We'd keep it a secret who you were, would that help you if I made orders in that regard?A.  No, your Honour.
Q.  It would also be possible for me to make orders if you were scared of something bad happening to you as a consequence of you giving evidence, then I could make an order that you be permitted to give your evidence by the audio visual screen up there?A.  I'm not scared, your Honour, I just don't remember.
Q.  Okay.  Do you understand, don't you, what I have said, that it just seems absurd that someone who was present when another person was shot wouldn't remember that event?A.  I had had lots of Xanax, your Honour, I just don't remember.
9I then warned the contemnor that it is a contempt of court to refuse to answer questions.  He confirmed that he was aware of that.  He also confirmed that he knew that the punishment for contempt includes a term of imprisonment or a large fine.  The contemnor specifically confirmed that he was aware he could go to gaol for refusing to answer questions. 
10I gave Mr Lewis the opportunity to discuss his position with Mr Clark who appeared for him then, as he does today.  I granted a short adjournment for that to occur. 
11After the adjournment Mr Lewis returned to the witness box and the following transpired:HIS HONOUR
Q.  Come back please and sit down.  Mr Lewis, having spoken to your counsel, are you prepared to tell us what you know about the circumstances surrounding Mr Todorovski's death?A.  I haven't really refused to answer any questions, I just don't remember, your Honour.""
12Mr Clark addressed me about the possible connection between the use of Xanax and the apparent absence of recollection experienced by Mr Lewis.  For reasons I gave in R v Abdallah (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 111, I refused his application for adjournment. 
13The impression I had then, as a provisional view only, was that Mr Lewis's case fell into the category discussed by the High Court of Australia in Coward v Stapleton (1953) 90 CLR 573 where it was held that a refusal to answer questions lawfully required to be answered in proceedings might be proved by the giving by the witness of answers which are so plainly absurd as to convey an intention not to give any real answer to questions to which they relate.  Mr Lewis's guilty plea today confirms my impression of the explanation for what occurred on 17 February 2014. 
14In my judgment in R v Abdallah; In the matter of John Leger given earlier today I fully discussed the principles governing contempt of this nature.  I will not restate them here.  They are adequately dealt with there.  Suffice it to say that contempt of this nature is almost always regarded by this Court as an objectively serious offence. 
15I will return in a moment to the matters relevant to fixing an appropriate penalty.  However, it is well that I now set out Mr Lewis's personal circumstances. 
16He currently resides in the State of Queensland with his mother.  He is 25 years of age and has been unemployed for some time.  He left school at the age of 15 and since then has performed work of a labouring type in the construction industry, when he can find it. 
17Importantly, he has no criminal record whatsoever and I am satisfied that by his guilty plea today he has pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and that that matter should count in his favour.  I should also record that when this matter has been mentioned before me during the R v Abdallah trial Mr Clark has appeared for Mr Lewis and has made it quite clear at all times that his expectation was that a plea of guilty would be entered as soon as the jury returned with a verdict. 
18Mr Clark explained that because of Mr Lewis's impecuniosity, and as he has been unexpectedly in custody since 17 February 2014, his solicitors have been unable to obtain any evidence of a psychiatric or psychological nature to put before the court.  I accept that explanation.  It might be said perhaps that a pre-sentence report could have been requested, but such a report takes time to be made available.  In a case such as this, it may be that that time could work to the disadvantage of the offender. 
19Mr Clark informs me that Mr Lewis, having been present when Mr Todorovski was shot, and having himself been within what might be called the ambit of the threat presented by the armed Mr Abdallah, has suffered symptoms of anxiety and depression since.  I accept that he may have suffered such symptoms.  That seems to accord with one's ordinary experience of life.  However, I could not in the absence of expert evidence accept on the balance of probabilities that he suffers from anything in the nature of a diagnosable psychiatric condition such as a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; and, in any event, it is evident on the facts that he has not received any medical treatment for such. 
20The considerations relevant to fixing a penalty in this case are the factors identified by Dunford J in Wood v Staunton (No 5) (1996) 86 A Crim R 183 to 185. 
21Mr Clark mentioned that a question of parity might arise between this offender and Mr Leger.  I imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of six months on Mr Leger this morning.  Having taken the opportunity to review the decision of the High Court in Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 462 over the adjournment, I am satisfied that the parity principle has no real application to the present case.  The parity principle applies to the punishment of co-offenders.  Although the limits of that term have not been defined with precision, it is clear that it applies to co-offenders properly so-called, as well as persons who might have different roles in a single criminal enterprise.  That principle does not apply to Mr Lewis and Mr Leger in my judgment.  They both committed similar crimes independently of each other in the same trial on the same day, they are not co-offenders even in an extended sense.  Accordingly, I think it unnecessary to have regard to the sentence passed on Mr Leger in considering the appropriate sentence to impose on Mr Lewis. 
22Having said that, clearly the principle of equal justice applies because general concepts of systematic fairness and reasonable consistency in sentencing must be borne in mind by a sentencing court.  However, it is clearly established by authority that consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles does not involve numerical equivalence; Hili v R; Jones v R (2010) 242 CLR 520 at 535-538.  According to the plurality in Green at 437[28] equal justice:
requires, so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike. Equal justice according to law also requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law.
23The relevant law here is the law of sentencing.  Although equal justice will require like offenders to be treated in a like manner, it also requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect.
24Bearing those matters of principle in mind, I turn to the relevant considerations. 
25The first is the seriousness of the contempt proved.  As I have said already today and in this judgment, a refusal to answer questions when required in a court of law threatens to undermine the administration of criminal justice, especially in respect of serious crimes.  And, as I have said, is objectively serious. 
26Secondly, there can be no question that Mr Lewis was well aware of the consequences to himself of what he did because those matters were made abundantly clear to him both before and after he had the opportunity of taking the advice of counsel. 
27Thirdly, so far as the actual consequences of the contempt are concerned, in my judgment, the evidence of Mr Lewis was of less relevance than the evidence of Mr Leger could have been.  This is because, applying hindsight, as the cases suggest one must, Mr Lewis's evidence did not add much to the strong Crown case in respect of the shooting of Mr Todorovski, and it would have added nothing in relation to the attempted murder of Mr Leger given that Mr Lewis was not in any sense an eyewitness to the facts giving rise to that charge.  His crime then is less serious, on that score anyway, than Mr Leger's. 
28Fourthly, was the contempt was committed in the context of a serious crime? Undoubtedly it was. 
29Fifthly what was the reason for the contempt?  I must say that, as I remarked to Mr Clark in the course of argument, I feel that I have not received in any way, shape or form a satisfactory explanation for the failure of Mr Lewis to give evidence in the trial.  I have heard argument on the basis of Mr Clark's submissions, and I do not doubt the sincerity of counsel in any way, quite the contrary, that Mr Lewis had some fear of Mr Abdallah. 
30Mr Abdallah, of course, has been in custody since his arrest in February of 2012.  Until he was remanded in custody, Mr Lewis was at large interstate and not in any position, on any evidence before me, to be under any threat from him. 
31Indeed, on the basis of what I have heard in a different context, Mr Lewis is concerned that there may be some network in gaol that may pose a threat if he remains in custody.  However, the logic of that is hard to follow.  First, he has refused to give evidence, and did not give evidence, so it could not be said that he was any kind of ""dog"", I think the expression is, according to evidence I heard during the trial.  Moreover, the fact that he might be at some threat whilst in custody is a matter which can only be laid at his own feet.  He would not be in custody had he not refused to give evidence. 
32Secondly, I have heard, in any event, that the harsh conditions in which he is held currently, to which I will return, are in part a function of the desire of the Corrective Services Department to offer him such protection as can be offered. 
33Accordingly, that there is no explanation given for the offending is a matter of some significance in my consideration of the appropriate sentence. 
34This is not a case where the sixth consideration has been offended by Mr Lewis; that is to say, he has not reneged on any deal he did with the authorities to give evidence in the trial.
35The seventh consideration is whether there has been an apology or contrition.  There certainly has been an apology.  Mr Clark very eloquently expressed this on behalf of his client.  I accept the apology.  That it was expressed by counsel does not diminish its significance given that a person of Mr Lewis's limited education and circumstances in life would be unable to express it in adequate terms.  After all, that is why one retains the benefit of skilled counsel. 
36I also accept the guilty plea may involve some element of contrition in this case given that Mr Lewis's contempt was constructive in the sense I have already discussed. 
37However, these matters can only go so far.  During the trial Mr Lewis appeared before me by way of audiovisual link represented by Mr Clark.  He was on that occasion given the opportunity to change his mind, in the light of his guilty plea I can say purge his contempt, which he declined to do.  In those circumstances, whilst, as I have said, the court accepts the apology, its utility is limited. 
38The next matter, the eighth matter, concerns the character and antecedence of the contemnor.  As I have already said, Mr Lewis has an entirely clean record.  At the age of 25 he is, of course, beyond the age of maturity and, no doubt, understood the ramifications, as I have already found, of the course he adopted in refusing to answer questions.  Nevertheless, his prior good conduct is a consideration that he is entitled to have me take into account in fixing the appropriate sentence, and I will do so. 
39I then turn to the ninth and tenth matters together, which are general and personal deterrence, and denunciation of the contempt.  These matters are of particular significance in prosecutions of this nature because, as it was put by Johnson J in R v Razzak [2006] NSWSC 1366, 166 A Crim R 132, there is a public interest in ensuring that disobedience of this law will be, and will be seen to be, punished.
40Mr Clark, whilst acknowledging the difficulties, has argued that I should give consideration in all the circumstances of this case to the availability of some form of non-custodial means of punishment.  Clearly a fine is out of the question given Mr Lewis's parlous financial circumstances, him being unemployed.  Mr Clark acknowledged that there might be some administrative difficulty given that the intention would be that Mr Lewis would continue to reside in Queensland with his mother.  Doubtless there are legislative arrangements for transferring offenders serving a sentence amongst the various states.  However, no detailed argument has been put to me today as to what they are.  It seems to me that it is likely that the administrative time taken in putting those arrangements in place would probably, in any event, eat up a large portion of the sentence I have in mind imposing.
41But applying the instinctive or intuitive process that is required of a sentencing judge, I have come to the conclusion that no penalty other than a term of full-time imprisonment is appropriate.  It is only in these circumstances that, if I may put it bluntly, an offender will feel the sting of the appropriate denunciation of his defiance of proper legal process. 
42However, taking into account all of the facts, matters and circumstances that are relevant in this case, including the matters I have identified as being in favour of Mr Lewis, I am of the view that, notwithstanding the principle of equal justice, there are relevant differences in this case which indicate that a much shorter sentence than that passed on Mr Leger is appropriate.  In particular, I wish to record that I have taken into account the early guilty plea, and in that regard I have allowed what I understand from the authorities to be the maximum available allowance of a 25 per cent discount on the sentence I would otherwise have imposed. 
43Matthew Lewis, you are convicted of the offence of contempt in the face of the court committed on 17 February 2014 in the trial of R v Abdallah.  I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months duration commencing on 17 February 2014 and expiring on 16 May 2014.
44I will add to the orders I have so far pronounced that the record be amended throughout so that these proceedings are designated as R v Abdallah; in the matter of Matthew Edward Lewis and that the reference to the Prothonotary as prosecutor should be struck out wherever it appears.

		24 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763475,NSW Crime Commission v Lee [2014] NSWSC 278,"JUDGMENT

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed in May 2010. On 13 May 2010, Buddin J made ex parte orders pursuant to s 10A and other provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) restraining all of the interests in property of the first defendant Jason Lee being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that he had engaged in serious crime related activity. 

2In June 2012 orders were sought under s 27 of the Act against the fourth defendant, Seong Won lee. On 19 June, Hidden J made an order s 10A restraining all of the interests in property of the fourth defendant.

3Consent orders were made in September 2012 under s 10B, for the reasonable legal expenses of the two defendants, in relation to a number of specified matters. 

4A further consent order was made in June 2013 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for an application to the High Court for special leave to appeal in relation to their conviction for drug supply and firearm offences. 

5A further consent order under s 10B was made in November 2013 in respect of their reasonable legal expenses incurred in respect of these proceedings, that order was varied by consent in December 2013.

6A further consent order was made in January 2014 under s 10B in relation to the defendants' reasonable legal expenses for the High Court appeal. 

7On 14 March 2014, the parties asked the Court to make further consent orders varying these earlier consent orders, by inserting in schedule two to the orders, two further properties located at Chifley and Waterloo. That was explained for the plaintiff to reflect that these properties have now been sold, realizing proceeds which are available for payment of legal expenses still outstanding in relation to the matters the subject to the earlier consent orders. 

8Having considered the circumstances in which the parties seek the making of the proposed further consent order and the terms of that order I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's powers be exercised to make orders in the terms agreed.

2763476,NSW Crime Commission v Pham [2014] NSWSC 277,"Judgment

1These proceedings were commenced by summons filed in March 2012. On 28 March, Davies J made ex parte orders pursuant to s 10A and other provisions of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW), restraining the defendant from taking certain steps in relation to property described in the schedules to the summons, being satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the defendant had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely the supply of the prohibited drug ecstasy contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). 

2On 14 March 2014, the parties ask the Court to make consent orders in terms which have been filed. Thereby the defendant warrants that his only interest in property at the date of signing the orders is that specified in the schedules to the order. 

3The plaintiff has conducted investigations which indicate that the proceeds derived by the defendant's illegal activities, that took place no more than 6 years before the application for the order, would exceed $90,000.

4Amongst other things the orders which are proposed contemplate that the defendants' reasonable legal costs of $10,000 be paid out of the defendant's property; that some $90,000 be paid to the Treasurer; and that a property at Cabramatta be sold, charged, mortgaged, leased or otherwise used to raise finance to enable the proceeds assessment order to be satisfied.

5The consent orders also note that in consideration of the orders being made, the defendant releases the Crown and the plaintiff from any claim for damages in consequence of the making of the restraining order or otherwise; agrees not to make any further application under s10D(1), while the proceeds assessment order remains unsatisfied; and that under s 31, until satisfied, the defendant's interest in property is charged to the Crown to the extent necessary to secure payment of the order.

6Having considered the circumstances in which the parties seek the making of the proposed consent orders, the terms of the orders themselves and the matters there referred to, I am satisfied that justice dictates that the Court's powers be exercised to make orders in the terms agreed. 

7For those reasons, I made orders in terms of the consent orders filed on 14 March 2014.

		18 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763482,Application by Paul Rajendran pursuant to s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 270,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Paul Rajendran, applies for an inquiry into his sentence under s.78(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The application seeks the referral of his matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

2This application is one of several made by persons who have been convicted and sentenced for offences carrying a standard non-parole period, who have unsuccessfully appealed against the conviction and/or sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and now seek a further hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that there is a doubt or question as to ""mitigating circumstances"" in the case, being the suggested infection of the original sentencing decision by Muldrock error: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

3The submissions of the New South Wales Attorney General challenged the Applicant's submission that Muldrock error may constitute a mitigating circumstance for the purposes of an application such as this. However, the Court of Appeal rejected that argument in Sinkovich v Attorney General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.

4The Attorney General submitted further that the Applicant had not demonstrated a foundation for any doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the Applicant's case based upon suggested Muldrock error.

5The Applicant was convicted after trial of an offence of having sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.

6On 15 April 2010, Payne DCJ sentenced the Applicant to a term of imprisonment of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of five years. The non-parole period expires on 10 August 2014. 

7On 17 December 2010, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Applicant against conviction and sentence: Rajendran v R [2010] NSWCCA 322; 206 A Crim R 316.

8In brief terms, the Applicant met the victim on an internet site on 2 March 2009. He masqueraded as an agent, looking for models to employ. After communicating with the Applicant for some days, the victim agreed to meet the Applicant. They met at a bar in Sydney, where the victim consumed champagne. They then walked to a nearby office, where the Applicant sexually assaulted the victim. He had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse, without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting.

9The Applicant submits that Muldrock error is revealed sufficiently in the remarks on sentence of the sentencing Judge. After recounting the circumstances of the offence, her Honour said (ROS9):

""In my view the objective seriousness of the offence falls within the middle range but in the band - if you see it as a band, which one must, being the middle range and the lower band of the middle range - towards the top of the lower band of the middle range.""

10The sentencing Judge turned to the Applicant's subjective circumstances, before returning to the relevance of the standard non-parole period (ROS11-12). Her Honour then said (ROS12):

""In my view, given the features I have stated, that is to say his prior good character, he is a person with no prior record, he has worked and because of his age has a reasonable stock of good character, it is those factors which in my view allow some modification in his favour of the standard non-parole period.""

11Before passing sentence, her Honour said (ROS12-13):

""Another reason for there being some modification of the standard non-parole period in this case is that I am of the view there are special circumstances, those special circumstances being that this is the first time he has served a custodial sentence, his requirement for supervision upon his release to reintegrate him back into the community after a substantial period in custody and to ensure that he does not re-offend. In my view he has fair to reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and his intelligence is a feature that will assist him in this regard. I give some weight also to the way he is serving the sentence, that is on protection. It is the combination of those matters that in my view call for a greater period of supervision in the community.

Having said that, the non-parole period I intend to impose is in my view the least possible in all the circumstances, given the objective seriousness of the offence and taking into account the subjective factors, but also giving weight which the Court must to the requirement for general deterrence.""

12On appeal, Simpson J (Blanch and Garling JJ agreeing) said in Rajendran v R at [70]:

""Her Honour determined, for the purposes of s 54B, that there were reasons for the departure, downwards, from the standard non-parole period. These were the appellant's prior good character and his employment history. She found, within s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the ratio there prescribed between the non-parole period and the head sentence.""

13The Court dismissed the sentence appeal, noting that the sentence imposed was well within the range available in the exercise of a sound sentencing discretion: Rajendran at R at [74].

14The present application focuses, in particular, upon the remarks on sentence of the sentencing Judge.

15The Applicant submits that a doubt or question is raised concerning a mitigating circumstance with the sentencing Judge adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing contrary to Muldrock. 

16The Attorney General submitted that, although her Honour's expression that the Applicant's subjective circumstances allowed some modification in his favour of the standard non-parole period suggested a two-stage process, a fair reading of the remarks on sentence as a whole indicated that there was no Muldrock error in this case. 

17In my view, it is open to conclude that the sentencing Judge engaged in an impermissible two-stage process to sentence, that is, by determining that the standard non-parole period was applicable and then determining whether there was anything that warranted a departure from that standard, contrary to Muldrock at [27]-[28]. The Court of Criminal Appeal noted that the sentencing Judge ""determined, for the purposes of s 54B, that there were reasons for the departure, downwards"" (see [12] above). Although the sentencing Judge sought to synthesise the objective and subjective factors before arriving at an appropriate sentence, it is open to the Applicant to contend that a primary or determinative significance was afforded to the standard non-parole period.

18There is, in my view, a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case warranting a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It will be for that Court to determine the merits of the case.

19The application is granted. The matter is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

		21 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763483,Application by Raouf Maurice Philopos pursuant to s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 271,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Raouf Maurice Philopos, applies for an inquiry into his sentence under s.78(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""Appeal and Review Act""). The Applicant submits that his matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

2This application is one of several made by persons who have been convicted and sentenced for offences carrying a standard non-parole period, having unsuccessfully appealed against the conviction and/or sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and now seek a further hearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that there is a doubt or question as to a ""mitigating circumstance"" in the case, in the form of suggested Muldrock error which affected the original sentencing exercise: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

3Section 79(1) and (2) Appeal and Review Act provide:

""(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.""

4The Applicant was convicted after trial by jury of six counts, being four counts of indecent assault contrary to s.61L Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of having sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61I of that Act. The offence under s.61L carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment. The offence under s.61I carried a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years.

5On 10 August 2006, Knox DCJ sentenced the Applicant to a total effective term of 12 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eight years to expire on 30 August 2014. 

6On 1 April 2008, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction and sentence: Philopos v R [2008] NSWCCA 66.

7The NSW Attorney General opposes the application, submitting that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance may not arise by reference to Muldrock error and that, in any event, there is insufficient evidence of Muldrock error to justify referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 

8The first submission of the Attorney General cannot be sustained in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.

9The issue on the application is whether there is a doubt or question concerning suggested Muldrock error to warrant referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s.79(1)(b) Appeal and Review Act.

10The facts of the offences may be stated briefly. On 2 April 2003, the Applicant attended Westmead Children's Hospital with his three-year old son, who was suffering from a severe asthma attack. In the early hours of 3 April 2003, the Applicant's son was transferred to a room on a ward. The Applicant was allowed to spend the night with his son and was provided with a chair bed to sleep on.

11The victim, who was 16 years old, was occupying another bed in the room, having been admitted for depression and severe social phobia. During the night, the Applicant engaged the victim in conversation a number of times before massaging her shoulders and touching her lower back, waist and thighs. He touched the victim on her genital area on the outside of her underpants and digitally penetrated the folds of the victim's vagina. He then placed the victim's hand on the outside of his pants, in the groin area, while the Applicant's penis was erect. The Applicant then pressed his penis into the folds of the victim's genitalia until he ejaculated, whilst the victim pressed her legs together to avoid any deeper penetration. The Applicant lifted the victim's pants and placed a piece of toilet paper on the victim's vagina. Finally, the Applicant kissed the right nipple of the victim's breast. The period of offending occurred over about an hour.

12The sentencing Judge imposed entirely concurrent sentences for each of the six offences. A fixed term of imprisonment for four months was imposed for each of the four s.61L offences. With respect to each of the s.61I offences, the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of eight years.

13The Applicant relied upon parts of the remarks on sentence in support of the claim of Muldrock error. Following consideration of the objective facts and the Applicant's subjective circumstances, Knox DCJ turned to the relevance of the standard non-parole period (ROS10):

""The standard non-parole period for the more serious of these offences is, as I have said, one of seven years' imprisonment. That would reflect normally a finding of mid-range criminality following a trial - which is the case here.

In my view there must be a finding at the very least of mid-range criminality. My overall assessment of the section 21A factors described under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not warrant any downward adjustment.

I should specify that I have not taken this into account as the starting point but I indeed have a greater regard to the maximum penalty and the fact that there are two separate counts of sexual intercourse which would attract the penalty, albeit arising from the same incident.""

14A little later, his Honour said (ROS10-11):

""There were six counts on an indictment which all involved the same victim, the same date, the same time and the one location. To some extent it must be said that they would have involved a separate feeling of violation by the complainant herself and that becomes apparent when one reviews as I have, the evidence given by [the victim] in that regard. In my view the relevant standard non-parole period is relevant but is, in fact, less than what is an appropriate sentence in this regard.""

15In determining the sentence appeal in Philopos v R, the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL, James and Barr JJ agreeing) said at [81]:

""Finally it was submitted that the sentence should have provided a non-parole period no greater than the standard for the sexual intercourse offences; being 7 years ""and probably less."" The non-parole period which his Honour provided was 8 years. However, in my opinion these were particularly serious offences. Advantage was taken of a 16 year old girl who had been hospitalised with psychiatric problems. The appellant assaulted her over a period of time during which, because of her condition, she was unable to complain or effectively resist his advances. The offences involved digital penetration followed ultimately by penile/vaginal penetration. In my opinion a total non-parole period for all of the offences in excess of the standard non-parole period was not excessive.""

16The Applicant submitted that the standard non-parole period was the determinative factor in the sentencing exercise at first instance. The sentencing Judge structured his reasoning by reference to the applicable standard non-parole period and the conclusion that the offending fell at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness. It was submitted that the standard non-parole period had been utilised in a way which went beyond use as a guideline or yardstick.

17It was submitted for the Attorney General that neither the approach of the sentencing Judge, nor that of the Court of Criminal Appeal, disclosed Muldrock error so that no doubt or question arose with respect to sentence. 

18It is necessary to read fairly the remarks on sentence. The sentencing Judge found ""at the very least ... mid-range criminality"". His Honour stated that an overall assessment of s.21A factors ""does not warrant any downward adjustment"". However, the sentencing Judge then stated that the standard non-parole period was not being taken into account as a starting point, with greater regard being had to the maximum penalty and that fact that several offences were committed by the Applicant against the victim. 

19The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole periods are both important legislative guideposts: Muldrock at [27]. 

20I am not satisfied that the approach of the sentencing Judge or the Court of Criminal Appeal discloses a two-stage sentencing process, nor that the standard non-parole period was accorded determinative significance.

21In these circumstances, no doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance has been demonstrated.

22The application is refused.

		21 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763487,Tran v R [2014] NSWCCA 32,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of Schmidt J.

2RA HULME J: The reasons disclosed in the judgment of Schmidt J reflect my own for joining in the refusal of leave to appeal.

3SCHMIDT J: On 4 March 2014, the Court refused the applicant Mr Tran leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him by Sorby DCJ in March 2010. He was then sentenced to 10 years imprisonment after a discount of 15% for his guilty plea for an offence of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, agreed to be some 10.124 kg of pseudoephedrine, an offence which his Honour found fell into the mid-range. There was also a finding of special circumstances, with the result a non-parole period of 6 years was imposed. 

4This was a relatively lenient sentence, given the objective seriousness of this offence, the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period 15 years (see s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)). The sentence imposed was the same as that imposed on the applicant's co-offender Mr Pham, after a discount of 25% for his early guilty plea. A severity appeal against that sentence was dismissed, it being observed that in addition to the 25% plea of guilty reduction, the non-parole period imposed was a further 5 years and 3 months or 35% less than the standard non-parole period (see Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208).

5The grounds of this application for leave to appeal were:

A. Absence of sufficient information before the sentencing judge: Mental Health/special circumstances; Family support; and Remorse; and

B. The Appellant's criminality was not ""on par with"" the co-accused, Pham, and sentencing consequently should not have indicated ""equal criminality"".


6The Crown opposed the leave sought in circumstances where the applicant sought to rely on considerable additional evidence which had not been led at the sentencing hearing, in order to establish his case. 

7Leave to appeal was refused, it being apparent that this evidence was not admissible and that the appeal simply had no merit. 

8The sentence which his Honour imposed on the applicant not only had to reflect the gravity of his offence, viewed objectively, as the evidence established, but also had to ensure that the non-parole period was not reduced below the minimum term which justice required the applicant to serve for the offence he had committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628). 

9The applicant was represented on sentencing by senior counsel, Mr Boulton SC. An agreed statement of facts was tendered, which revealed the objectively serious offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. The applicant did not then himself give evidence, but relied on a report provided by the psychologists Dr Colquhoun, Ms Do and Ms Iskander, as well as other documents. He also called evidence from his father and his long term partner, Ms De Salvo.

10On appeal the applicant sought to rely on advice which he had received after sentence as to his prospects of success on appeal, as well as other material since obtained, which it was submitted ""may have had significant impact on the considerations of the sentencing judge at the time"". That included a report of a psychologist Mr Watson-Munro, of 6 November 2012, as well as statements and affidavits which the applicant, his father, his brother, his mother, Ms de Salvo and her mother and father had each made in 2013. They dealt with the applicant's mental state and other matters known at the time of the sentencing hearing, as well as developments subsequently in relation to matters such as the applicant's experiences in custody which had led to developments in his remorse and contrition and the difficulties which his custodial sentence had caused the applicant and his family.

11An applicant for leave to appeal a sentence is generally bound by evidence and the case which he or she advanced at the sentencing hearing and may not seek to re-litigate that case on appeal, improving it by calling evidence which could then have been called, but was not. 

12The principles governing the calling of further evidence on appeal are those discussed in Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [104] - [110]:

""104 The general principle is that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at p 377. That applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals. 

105 The rule is far from absolute, and has been diluted over the years. In criminal cases it has long been recognised that the rigour with which it is applied must be tempered in order to accommodate the interests of justice: Green v The King [1939] HCA 4; 61 CLR 167, per Latham CJ; Ratten v The Queen [1974] HCA 35; 131 CLR 510 per Barwick CJ. In criminal cases, two important but competing policy considerations collide: 

(1) that the administration of justice requires finality in litigation; in general, parties to litigation (including criminal litigation) have one, and one only, opportunity to present their cases in the best light they can, and are bound by the conduct of their cases at first instance; 

(2) that error in the sentencing process, however caused, that is the occasion of injustice, ought to be remedied. 

But there are limits as to the extent to which the court may legitimately accept additional evidence. There is no call here to consider the application of the principles in appeals against conviction: these have most recently been considered in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 and Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61 at [282] and following. These remarks are confined to the circumstances in which this Court may properly, and will, admit and take account of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence, in respect of which a distinct sub-set of principles has evolved. 

106 I say ""additional evidence"" because a distinction has been drawn between ""fresh"" evidence and ""new"" evidence: see Abou-Chabake , per Kirby J, at [63]. 

107 ""Fresh"" evidence has been defined by Mason J (as he then was) in Lawless v The Queen [1979] HCA 49; 142 CLR 659 at p 675 as: 

""... evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and ... evidence which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence."" 

""New"" evidence, on the other hand, is evidence that does not qualify as ""fresh"", either because it was available, but not used, at first instance, or because, in the exercise of reasonable diligence it could have been obtained. The distinction is important in the present case. 

108 If evidence qualifies as fresh evidence, its admission may depend upon a further criterion - the evaluation of its capacity to have affected the outcome of the proceedings at first instance. If it is not judged to have that capacity, its admission is pointless, and, while it has to be considered in order for that evaluation to be made, the evidence may not, in the result, be acted upon: see, for example, Fordham . 

109 It may be thought that, on the definition as stated by Mason J, evidence of facts, circumstances and events that have arisen subsequently to the first instance decision would qualify as fresh evidence because it meets both criteria. However, with respect to applications for leave to appeal against sentence, there is an additional, sometimes intractable, barrier to admissibility. Jurisdiction of this Court in sentencing matters derives from s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The powers of the Court are spelled out in s 6(3) which is in the following terms: 

""6(3) ... the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal."" 

110 A fundamental pre-condition to the exercise of the power of the Court to quash a sentence and pass another sentence is the formation of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. In other words, this Court, as a matter of law, cannot interfere with a sentence passed at first instance unless it has identified some error, either in the sentencing process or in the outcome of the sentencing process. That has this additional implication: axiomatically, evidence of events or circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since sentencing cannot be taken into account, no matter how compelling they may be. If the facts did not exist at the time of sentencing, it cannot have been an error for the sentencing judge not to have taken them into account. In those circumstances, the impact on the sentence is a matter for the executive government: R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177.""


13It was submitted for the applicant that the additional evidence on which he wished to rely was relevant on sentencing, but no attempt was made to establish that it was admissible under these principles. Clearly it was not. 

14In so far as this evidence concerned events, circumstances or facts that have arisen entirely since the applicant was sentenced, such as the applicant's evidence as to insights he has since gained, it could not be taken into account on sentence. The evidence which the applicant himself sought to give and to call from his partner, her parents and his parents as to his subjective circumstances and the reasons for his offending dealt with matters about which he had already led evidence on sentencing and which the sentencing judge took into account. The applicant had also already relied on a psychologist's report on sentencing. That was also taken into account. It was thus apparent that this further evidence was neither fresh nor new and could not be admitted on appeal.

15The complaint raised by the first ground of appeal, that there was an absence of sufficient information before the judge with respect to the necessary considerations of issues such as mental health, the finding of special circumstances, family support and remorse, could thus not be sustained. A simple reading of his Honour's judgment revealed that the applicant has already received the benefit of a favourable finding as to special circumstances, reflective of the evidence which he led as to these matters. 

16His Honour referred to the applicant's family background, and the circumstances of the failure of his floor sanding business and a restaurant, despite his family's considerable support. He also referred to the evidence of the further strong support the applicant would receive from his family on release. His Honour also referred to Ms de Salvo's evidence as to the applicant's remorse and shame for his offending and the hurt he had caused her and his family and that she would stick by him. He also referred to the remorse he had explained to Dr Colquhoun; his limited criminal record; his good character, which was relevant to an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation, which were accepted to be positive. This enabled the exercise of a discretion in the applicant's favour, in relation to the statutory non-parole ratio. His Honour also noted that the offender had no issues with drugs or alcohol, but that his offence was motivated by greed.

17The sentencing judge's remarks showed that his Honour took favourable account of this evidence, both in the total sentence imposed and the special circumstances found. The result was that for his mid-range offence, the applicant received a non-parole period of 6 years, when the standard non-parole period for such an offence was 15 years, and a total term of 10 years, after a 15% discount for his plea. 

18The second ground relied on was that the applicant's circumstances were not on par with that of his co-offender Mr Pham and that the ""sentencing should not have indicated 'equal criminality'."" 

19His Honour also expressly considered parity, concluding that the applicant had acted as an intermediary between Mr Pham and another member of the organisation described as his ""Chinese friend"". After describing the particular roles which they each played in the supply of the drugs the subject of this charge, he concluded that this offence fell within the mid-range; that it was objectively serious; that general deterrence was of particular importance; that the applicant's role was as one of the negotiators, organisers and co-coordinators in the activities involved in the supply of the drug; that his role was of significance, although not as great at the organisational level as that of Mr Pham, but still his role was pivotal in that he allowed others to get their hands on the drug; and that without his contact with his Chinese friend, the whole scheme would not have taken place. In the result, the applicant's criminality was found to be on par with that of Mr Pham. His Honour also considered that the applicant was 18 months younger than Mr Pham and had strong subjective factors in his favour, with the result that his Honour concluded that despite the differences in the discounts which they received, the offender should receive the same sentence as Mr Pham.

20These conclusions were reflected in the sentence imposed on the applicant whose sentence before discount commenced at 11 years, 9 months, while that imposed on Mr Pham started at 13 years, 4 months. That reflected the conclusions reached as to the respective objective seriousness of the two offences and the differing subjective circumstance of the offenders. The sentence imposed on Mr Pham was already a lenient one. The sentence imposed on the applicant was also lenient in his circumstances, reflective of the conclusions which his Honour reached as to the seriousness of his offence, parity considerations, the need for deterrence and the consequences which should flow from the favourable view which he took of the evidence of the applicant's subjective circumstances.

21It was apparent, in those circumstances, that neither ground of appeal had any merit and that leave to appeal had to be refused.

		18 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763490,KJS v R [2014] NSWCCA 27,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Introduction
The appellant, pursuant to s5(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, appeals against his conviction with respect to two offences of which he was found guilty by a jury. Each of the offences alleges a sexual assault upon his natural daughter, ISS:

(i) Aggravated indecent assault between 26 September 2003 and 25 September 2004.

(ii) Aggravated sexual intercourse without consent between 1 January and 31 January 2008.

The circumstance of aggravation in both counts was that the complainant was under the authority of the appellant.

2The trial was heard before Judge Murrell SC and a jury from 19 March to 23 March 2012. The jury retired to consider its verdict on the afternoon of 23 March 2012, returning the following afternoon with verdicts of guilty to both counts. On 17 August 2012 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years and a balance of term of 6 years which was partially accumulated on another sentence. No appeal has been brought in respect of sentence.

3The appellant had previously been convicted of murdering his wife. That matter was the subject of an unsuccessful appeal to this Court in KJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 132.

Crown case at trial

4ISS was one of three children born to the appellant and his wife. ISS was born in 1991. Her sister, S, and brother, J, were both younger than she by about 7 and 9 years respectively. The family lived at various locations in Western Sydney, including St Johns Park, Edensor Park and Fairfield.

5To establish the overall context of the charged offences, evidence was placed before the jury about other sexual acts which occurred before count 1, and between counts 1 and 2. It is the admission of this evidence about which the appellant complains.

6The context evidence related to the appellant getting into the bath with ISS and washing her back when she was 11, getting into the shower on occasions thereafter and washing her; there were then other indecent and/or sexual assaults in similar terms to the two charged events and finally attempted indecent and/or sexual assaults where no actual assault took place because the complainant would tell him loudly to get out of the room.

7When asked about an incident in relation to a bath when she was living at St Johns Park, ISS said:

""I was in year 6 and I had been upset about a boy and I had gone to my father for advice and then after that I had entered the bathroom and I had proceeded to have just a normal bath. I am not sure how long after my father came in and had gotten undressed and had got into the bath tab with me and just made it look - it seemed like it was normal, there was nothing wrong and then proceeded to talk to me normally about this particular boy at the time - yeah; I had my back facing him and I was facing the wall and he was behind me and he was just washing my back.""

8ISS said that there were numerous other incidents thereafter while she was in year 6 in 2003 when she was either having a shower or a bath and the appellant would just come in and wash her body and make it seem normal. At that time he said to her ""Just don't mention this to your mum. It'll be kind of like daddy and daughter's little secret"". She said initially he was just coming in and washing her body but then he started touching her chest more.

9ISS described the incident in count 1 at St Johns Park as follows:

""I remember being in my bedroom and I was in year 7. I recall being in my room and I remember it was daytime, I don't think anybody was home. I think I was reading and KJS had some how gotten me on the floor and he proceeded to undo my pants and pull them down, he had my arms down on the ground with his arms so that I couldn't push him off - he then pulled his pants down and his undies down and he put his penis on the top part of my vagina and he proceeded to thrust. I said that it really hurt and I asked him to stop and all he said was ""Just wait, just wait"" that's all he kept saying was ""just wait"", and then he stopped.""

10She said that once he stopped, he pulled his pants up so he could ejaculate. She said that she lay there crying as he left and all he said was ""sorry"". She then got up and grabbed a pair of scissors and started cutting near her wrists because ""I didn't want to be there or here and I just hated everything about my life"".

11When asked if anything else of a sexual nature happened between her and her father while at St Johns Park, ISS said:

""It was very repetitive ... on the occasion that he would come in at night time and, or when nobody was home. The touching was very frequent."" 

She said that he would always try to touch her chest and vagina.

12When the family moved to Edensor Park she said that her mother would rarely be home at night due to commitments with the Southern Districts Football Association and would often not be home until 1am, 2am or even 3am. By this time ISS said that the appellant would come in, or try to come into her room, almost every night when her mother was not home or while she was asleep. She said that as time progressed, she became a very light sleeper to the point that before she moved to Fairfield West, she could barely sleep. When she woke up to him trying to come into her room, she would say ""Get out"" and if her mother were home she would say it loud enough to try and wake her up and to scare her father who was worried about anyone else finding out.

13On the occasions he did come into her room, she said:

""He'd really try hard to sneak in and on the times that I had woken up while he was sneaking in he would say ""I'm trying to find my work clothes in the basket"" or ""I'm turning off your radio"" or some excuse, and then on times when I was still asleep I would wake up and I'd have the blankets off and he was trying to get my pants off me but slow enough that I, that I wouldn't wake up and see. ... He would pull his pants down and lay on top of me so not, so that I couldn't, I was restricted in my movements. And he would press his penis on my vagina where I'm supposed to urinate and thrust - and thrust continuously until he was finished.""

14When the mother was home, ISS said that she would tell her father to ""Get out"" loudly in the hope that her mother would hear. She said that her father would tell her to be quiet and then leave without doing anything of a sexual nature. ISS said that as she grew up, she understood what her father was doing and got into the habit of making New Year's resolutions that she would not let it happen again. In particular, in December 2007 when she was sixteen she said that she was more determined than ever to not let it happen again but it did in January.

15In relation to that occasion (which constituted count 2) ISS said:

""He had come into my room and again proceeded to, proceeded to take off my clothing and he had taken off his pants. He put his penis on my vagina again but this time it was further down. ... It hurt a lot, a lot more than usual. He was dry and he kept trying to push through and he told me that once it gets through it won't hurt any more.""

She said that he ""tried to put it in this hole but it was really hard"". She said that his penis had gone past the outer lips of her vagina and penetrated. ISS said that she had struggled and pleaded with him to stop and leave her alone saying ""Get off"" and ""Leave me alone"".

The appellant's case

16The appellant denied any sexual interaction with ISS. In cross-examination of ISS it was suggested that she left home on 31 July 2008 after a physical fight with her mother. It was suggested that the argument was triggered by her continuing to see her boyfriend against the express instructions of her parents. It was put to ISS that when her father told her that he could no longer ""stick up"" for her with her mother, she threatened to ""destroy"" her parents.

17The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. He said that during the years 2003 - 2008 he worked fulltime as a plumber, typically leaving home for work at about 6am. His late wife was very involved in district soccer at the time, although her principal commitments in that regard were confined to the first couple of months of each season. The appellant denied the charged incidents and denied any sexual activity of any nature with his daughter. He told the jury that he had spoken to his daughter on 31 July 2008 to tell her he could no longer take her part against her mother and that in response, she had threatened to destroy him. 

18The context evidence was the subject of an application to the trial judge on 19 March 2012 after the jury had been empanelled, but before the Crown case had been opened. Objection was taken to the Crown's intention to lead the relationship evidence and her Honour ruled that the evidence was admissible.

19Her Honour's reasons were as follows:

""4. The Crown seeks to tender the evidence of relationship and context, first, to establish that neither the first nor the second charged incident was an isolated incident. That is, it followed from conduct of a sexualised nature and represented, in each case, some escalation of the preceding conduct. The charged incidents are quite dramatic allegations and, if left in isolation, each might appear implausible. A second purpose of the tender of relationship and context evidence is to establish the gradual escalation of sexualised behaviour. This could be characterised as an overbearing of the complainant or a grooming over a long period of time, which is relevant to the complainant's acquiescence and lack of complaint, albeit the complainant says that, towards the end of the period, i.e., towards January 2008, she increasingly resisted and verbalised her lack of consent to the interaction.""

20In relation to prejudice, her Honour said:

""6. I accept that this material is, inherently, extremely prejudicial. It is also very relevant. I will permit the material to be led in a brief and un-colourful fashion, on the basis that I hope will give appropriate directions to remove any prejudice.""

Grounds of appeal and submissions

21The appellant advances a single ground of appeal:

Her Honour erred in admitting into evidence the ""relationship"" or ""context"" evidence.

22The appellant submitted that the asserted ""relationship evidence"" relating to events before those in count 1 was so different to that conduct that the only context which it could provide was that the appellant had an inappropriate sexual interest in ISS. He submitted that the allegations regarding washing his daughter in the bath while naked suggested a level of inappropriateness but did not otherwise demonstrate attempts at sexual conduct.

23The appellant submitted that in relation to the pre-count 1 ""relationship"" evidence relied upon, none of it explained why ISS did not complain about the attempted sexual intercourse to her mother. He submitted that it followed that the evidence was not relevant for that purpose.

24The appellant submitted that the ""relationship"" evidence did not demonstrate some level of grooming. He submitted that there was a significant disconnect between the type of behaviour alleged to have occurred in the bath and shower and the very explicit and violent activity described in counts 1 and 2.

25The appellant submitted that it was difficult to identify the effect of such evidence and that it would always be available to some extent as context. He submitted that despite this, on the facts of this case, the impugned evidence was principally and in effect, evidence of his asserted inappropriate sexual interest in his daughter. In those circumstances, the appellant submitted that its admissibility should have been assessed in accordance with sections 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995. The appellant relied upon the analysis of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed) in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272.

26He submitted that even if that were not the case, its probative value was outweighed by its unfair prejudice and it should have been excluded pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act. The appellant submitted that the evidence was so unfairly prejudicial that even though her Honour gave the appropriate directions, they would not have been sufficient to overcome that prejudice.

27In relation to uncharged events said to have occurred between counts 1 and 2, the appellant noted that these involved explicit acts like those involved in the two counts and the evidence was that they increased in regularity to the point that they occurred almost every night. The appellant submitted that these allegations lacked both specificity as to time and detail and in some cases, nothing in the bedroom in fact occurred.

28The appellant accepted that the uncharged acts which were closer in time to the events said to have occurred in count 2, had more indicia of context evidence. He submitted, however, that the suggestion that they were occurring almost every night, made them overwhelming in nature. He submitted that while they were in part capable of being used as context evidence, they were clearly also being used as evidence of a tendency on his part to sexually assault his daughter. He submitted that in those circumstances they should have been dealt with pursuant to ss97 and 101 of the Evidence Act.

29In the alternative, the appellant submitted that the allegations, particularly those to the effect that these events were occurring almost every night, carried with them such unfair prejudice that the jury was bound to convict, particularly when not directed that they would have to find beyond reasonable doubt that these events occurred before using them in their reasoning as to his guilt upon the two counts. In that regard, the evidence should have been excluded pursuant to s137 Evidence Act 1995.

30The appellant submitted that in relation to those occasions when it was alleged he entered the room but did nothing because the complainant told him to leave in a loud voice, no real purpose was served with respect to the issues at trial. He submitted that their real function was as evidence of his inappropriate sexual interest and his tendency, if not thwarted, to attempt to sexually assault ISS.

Consideration

31The appellant's submission should not be accepted.

32There are two sexual acts set out on the indictment. The Crown case was that these incidents were not isolated but occurred against a much more extensive background of sexualised touching, extending from when ISS was in year 6 at school and aged about 11, up to when she was aged 16 and the events in count 2 occurred. 

33In that regard, the evidence led as to context evidence was relatively confined. It comprised touching while bathing, incidents of simulated intercourse, usually at night, which then escalated to actual intercourse. The temporal framework was quite clearly defined and could not have prejudiced the appellant in the conduct of his defence.

34The relevance and purposes for which the Crown sought to lead this evidence are clear:

(i) To demonstrate that there was a process of habituating ISS to physical contact with the appellant so that such contact seemed unremarkable.

(ii) To place count 1 in its proper context so that rather than appearing to be an extraordinary assault which had suddenly occurred, it could be seen as a result of a course of conduct in which sexual touching had been established between the appellant and ISS as a normal activity and had progressed to a more serious form of indecent touching.

(iii) To provide a proper basis for the jury to make an assessment of the description by ISS of count 1 and more particularly her failure to resist the appellant, to cry out for help or to otherwise express surprise at what was, viewed in isolation, an almost unbelievable anomaly in the father/daughter relationship.

(iv) To place count 2 in its proper context so that, rather than appearing to be another isolated and quite extraordinary sexual attack upon ISS, the offence was seen as the continuation and culmination of a consistent course of conduct over a period of years.

(v) To provide some explanation for the failure of ISS to complain about her father's conduct. Without the evidence of what could readily be considered as a slow process of habituating ISS to sexual activity, the jury might well have found it incredible that after the occurrence of count 1 (and later count 2), ISS made no complaint.

35Viewed in that way, it matters not that at least initially the conduct (i.e. bathing and touching) was different to the acts reflected in counts 1 and 2. This is particularly so when the evidence was not being led as coincidence evidence or evidence of the appellant's tendency to act in a way similar or identical to that described in the charged incidents. There was no requirement for similarity of conduct between the acts led as context evidence and the acts led as charged counts.

36It was important for the jury to be in a position to assess the evidence of the charged incidents against the broader background of the developing nature of the sexual acts. That the earliest incidents involved touching in the context of the bath or shower matters not. Its relevance was not that it showed other similar acts to the acts charged but that it showed a clear process of grooming ISS. That count 1 involved a different type of behaviour did not make inadmissible what happened before. That count 1 represented an escalation in the sexual conduct was the product of the grooming or habituation process.

37Given what had gone before (the reference to ""daddy and daughter's little secret"") made it more likely that ISS would accept the conduct and not tell others about it. That was part of its relevance to the Crown case and was important to the jury's understanding of the apparent acceptance by ISS of much of the conduct and her failure to complain about it before leaving home.

38There is another way of looking at the evidence which strengthens the conclusion that it was properly characterised as context evidence. Were the evidence to have been excluded, the jury would have been left with an unrealistic and entirely misleading picture of two apparently unconnected sexual assaults, separated in time by some three or so years, which occurred in startling isolation. This was in the context of an otherwise ordinary father-daughter relationship about which ISS made no complaint. That would have placed the Crown case in a position of considerable unfairness. 

39The admission of the evidence as context evidence was consistent with authority. In HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334 Gleeson CJ (with whom Crennan and Kiefel JJ agreed) said:

""6 Information may be relevant, and therefore potentially admissible as evidence, where it bears upon assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue by assisting in the evaluation of other evidence. It may explain a statement or an event that would otherwise appear curious or unlikely. It may cut down, or reinforce, the plausibility of something that a witness has said. It may provide a context helpful, or even necessary, for an understanding of a narrative. An example is some evidence given in R v Wickham. A female complainant in a child sex abuse case gave an account, directly relevant to a charge, of a sexual encounter she had with her father when she was 14 years old. She said that her father entered her bed, and had sexual intercourse with her. After some brief conversation, they both went to sleep. The father denied that any such event occurred. There was other evidence to show a history of similar sexual activity before the occasion in question. In the absence of that evidence, the complainant's account of what otherwise would have been presented as a single, and apparently isolated, act might have been regarded by the jury as difficult to believe. The complainant expressed no surprise when her father came to her bed. She made no protest. She behaved as though this was a common occurrence. She said that, in fact, it was a common occurrence. If she had not been permitted to say that, her evidence could have appeared hard to believe. To have put her evidence forward as though she were describing an isolated incident would have been misleading, and, it might be added, unfair. Jurors are told that, in evaluating evidence, they should use their common sense and their experience of life. Whether or not expressly invited to do so, jurors are likely to assess competing versions of events or conduct by reference to their ideas of normal or predictable behaviour. In R v Boardman in a passage later cited with approval in this Court, Lord Cross of Chelsea said that there are cases in which to exclude evidence of the kind presently in question would be an affront to common sense. The law must apply a more definite test, but common sense and relevance are closely related. A jury's assessment of some kinds of evidence is likely to be based more upon common sense than upon scientific method.""

40The above analysis and statement of principle largely answer the appellant's reliance upon s137 of the Evidence Act. Section 137 requires a court to exclude evidence adduced by the prosecutor if ""its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice"" to the accused person. The unfair prejudice relied upon by the appellant was the danger that the jury would use the context evidence as establishing (to a standard lower than the criminal standard) his propensity to sexually assault his daughter and thus inevitably his guilt of the charged offences.

41The probative value of the evidence was substantial. Without it the Crown's case would, for the reasons set out by Gleeson CJ, have offended common sense. For there to have been unfair prejudice by the admission of the evidence it had to be assumed that the jury would ignore the directions given to it as to the proper approach to the consideration of the context evidence. Such an assumption is contrary to the well established tenet of the criminal justice system, i.e. that juries understand and comply with the direction of trial judges (Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 109 A Crim R 580 at [31]; Glennon v R [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at [603] and Hinch & Macquarie Broadcasting Holdings Ltd v Attorney-General (Vic) [1987] HCA 56; 164 CLR 15 at [74]). There was nothing in this case to suggest that the jury would not follow directions and engage in impermissible reasoning.

42Here the jury were appropriately cautioned and directed as to the use to be made of the context evidence and no challenge is made in this appeal to those directions. There is no reason to think that the jury ignored or overlooked her Honour's clear direction. Her Honour was correct to conclude that while the context evidence carried with it some risk, it was not a risk of such a nature as to outweigh its probative value or be incapable of being addressed by appropriate direction.

43Those directions were:

""40 If you accept the complainant's evidence that any or all of the other sexual incidents occurred, then that evidence can only be used in one way. And that way is to place the complainant's evidence concerning the two charges in a realistic context. The Crown says that this evidence of other sexual incidents is important to give a realistic context to the complainant's evidence about the charges for two reasons. First, if you only had the evidence about the charges and you didn't have the evidence from the complainant about these other sexual incidents, then you would be saying to yourselves: well, the charged incidents would not have occurred because these sorts of things do not just happen out of the blue. And that is one reason why the Crown has introduced this material to show that, on the complainant's version of events, it was not a case of out of the blue. The second way in which the Crown says that the other sexual incidents put the allegations about the charged incidents into context is that the evidence is relevant to explaining why the complainant did not immediately complain to someone after the two charged incidents. The Crown says that you could look at this history, if you like, of other sexual incidents as a background that shows that the complainant had been intimidated or coerced or affected psychologically, perhaps you would call it grooming, over a long period of time. Hence, when the charged incidents happened she did not immediately rush and complain because, from her perspective ""that was part of normal family life"".

41 Members of the jury if you accept that there was a background of other sexual incidents, that background is not evidence that either of the alleged offences occurred. It may only be used to put the complainant's allegations about the two offences that have been charged into a realistic context. For example, you must not use the evidence of other sexual incidents as tending to show that, at the time of the charged incidents, the accused had improper sexual feelings for the complainant and therefore it is more likely that he committed the offences. Nor must you reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong or another occasion, therefore it is more likely he behaved improperly on the occasions the subject of the charges. If you accept the evidence about the other sexual incidents, then the only purpose for which you may use that evidence is to put the complainant's allegations about the charges into a realistic context.""

44There is another consideration which is relevant to s137 of the Evidence Act 1995. The proof of the charges against the appellant depended wholly on the evidence of ISS. If the jury did not find her a credible witness, it could not have accepted her evidence as to the charged counts. If that were the case, nothing in her evidence of other acts could have affected the assessment of her credibility. The context evidence was not such that it could have been used in substitution for the charged counts. If ISS had been assessed as unreliable for any reason - memory failure, hostility to her father, revenge etc - nothing she said about other acts could have saved the Crown case.

45This ground of appeal has not been made out.

46The order which I propose is that the appeal be dismissed.

47ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

48R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		18 March 2014",2014-03-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763495,R v Lee [2014] NSWDC 52,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Drug dealers come in all shapes and sizes, some are small scale, some are large scale. Some do it out of desperation, some do it for the substantial financial rewards it brings. Some keep their drug dealing activities from their families and some involve their families in it.

2Matthew Lee appears for sentence having been a significant drug dealer, motivated to a large extent by money, who not only got his wife involved in his drug dealing activities but conducted them in his home where his two very young children lived. That is enough to indicate the seriousness of his conduct and to explain why he must go to gaol for a very long time.

3In October 2012 police became aware of a drug supply operation being run from the offender's home in Tamworth. They installed video surveillance equipment so that they could record the frequent customer traffic, with purchasers of drugs regularly attending the offender's home so they could buy drugs from him. A little later they installed further surveillance equipment in the offender's home which enabled them to record what was said within it.

4The evidence established that the offender was supplying both cannabis and methylamphetamine to a large number of clients who would park their vehicles outside his premises and go inside on a frequent and regular basis, throughout the day and night, to buy cannabis and methylamphetamine, often when the offender's children were present in the home.

5A statement of facts was tendered this morning which records in great detail things that were said by the offender and others within his home and observations of purchases arriving at the offender's premises. I have of course read those, but I will summarise them very succinctly with the aid of a summary that the Crown prepared at my request.

6From 29 October 2012 until 20 December 2012 the offender supplied drugs on 140 separate occasions. There were other supplies that cannot be specified as well. One of the recorded conversations has the offender speaking about past supplies of methylamphetamine totalling half a pound or 227 grams as well as ten pounds of cannabis.

7I mentioned that the number of people attending his premises was substantial and frequent. On one day during the period where police were observing what was going on, he had 18 customers. He supplied on multiple occasions to truck driver named Warrick Smith, with his sales of methylamphetamine being for quantities between 1 gram and 7 grams and his supplies of cannabis being from 1 gram to half a pound. 

8The recordings also enabled police to learn about other offences committed by the offender. An offence of receiving where, through methods that were not terribly clear, the offender received $4,000 worth of clothes which had been stolen, and more importantly the offender was heard to shorten a shotgun and then to describe what he intended to do with it, namely to use it as a deterrent to protect him and his family and to protect his drugs as well. 

9Ultimately police arrested the offender and his wife. He was found on arrest to have $7,250 in cash in his pocket with a further $150 cash in his car. He also had two mobile phones. 

10Police executed a search warrant at the offender's home. They found, amongst other things, a number of plastic bags and containers containing what was later found to be 58.46 grams of methylamphetamine, most of it in the fridge in the premises in various containers and clip seal bags. It is apparent that the offender had divided bulk quantity of methylamphetamine up into smaller quantities of various sizes to satisfy his customer's various demands. Police found CCTV cameras installed in the premises so that the goings on outside the house could be observed from within the house. There was a police radio scanner which was operating at the time, enabling those within the house to listen to police radio transmissions. Also found during the search were a number of other items clearly related to drug supply as well as drug use. They found the shortened 12 gauge shotgun in an unlocked cupboard in the kitchen as well as the sawn off lengths of barrels no longer attached to the rest of the firearm.

11I mentioned before the presence of children, it is significant to note that on the baby's change table in the main bedroom police found syringes, alcohol swabs and, in a black bag on the change table, six shotgun shells, one of them a hollow point solid slug. 

12The facts tendered by the Crown bear out the impression which I trust was given at the beginning of these remarks on sentence, that the offender's misconduct is serious indeed. He now faces sentence for the following matters, an offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account two other matters. The charge of receiving that I mentioned earlier and a charge of not keeping the firearm, the 12 gauge shotgun safely, that of course relating to it being found in an unlocked kitchen cupboard. I am also to sentence him for supplying a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine which relates to the quantity of that drug found in the offender's premises when they were searched by police. Clearly as I mentioned, those drugs were packaged up ready for sale. He faces a charge of supplying cannabis relating to the supplies to those customers who sought that drug which occurred during the period of police observation and earlier. He faces a charge of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm - that of course is the shortened shotgun. That offence, I should mention has as well as a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, a standard non-parole period of three years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period in deciding the appropriate sentence for that matter. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence. The offender is also to be sentenced for an offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime, relating to the cash found on him on his arrest, and then on a 166 certificate are other matters for which I must impose sentence, namely conducting drug premises and shortening the firearm.

13There is little in the offender's background to explain why it was that he would decide to conduct such a large scale drug supply operation. He was a drug user, I will get to why he was in a little while, but unlike a lot of drug dealers who wish to supply only to support their habit, the offender's motivation went far beyond that. The evidence is overwhelming that a large part of what motivated this offender were the large financial rewards that large scale drug dealing can bring.

14The offender is now 29 years of age. His father was an alcoholic who died in 2007. His father's death affected Mr Lee for obvious reasons. The offender was raised in country New South Wales and whilst he has told a psychologist that he was frequently in conflict with his teachers he had never been suspended or expelled from school. After leaving school he had a good work history until 2010; he has not worked since. Whilst working in abattoirs he suffered an injury. At the time of his arrest he was undergoing various investigations as to some symptoms of lower back pain and pins and needles that he had reported. Those investigations could not be completed because of his arrest.

15The offender started using drugs at the age of 15, first cannabis and then amphetamines. He stopped using for a while but then relapsed again later. When his father died at the age of 22 he began using more drugs, the psychologist says as a means of coping under stress and in relation to grief issues. Since his arrest and his placement in custody he has been able to reflect on the effect that drug use has had upon his life. He expressed relief that he is now drug free and whilst in custody has been undergoing alcohol and other drug education. It cannot be said that there are good prospects for his rehabilitation given the nature of his addiction in the past, but there is hope for the future.

16Ms Hall who appears for the offender argued that the offender's operations were not sophisticated. I suppose they could have been more sophisticated, but they really were as sophisticated as they needed to be. He was able to attract large numbers of customers, he was able to make significant sums of money, he was able to source significant quantities of drugs so that he could on supply them and where appropriate he cut those drugs down to maximise his profits. He shortened a 12 gauge shotgun and was prepared to use it if necessary to protect himself, and his family, and his drugs and he installed closed circuit television with cameras viewing the front and back of his house. Perhaps the only thing that was unsophisticated was that he conducted his drug supply operations in a way which would inevitably come to the attention of police.

17From the description of his activities and the magnitude of them, even a casual passer by would have observed suspicious activity. In that sense this operation was always doomed to fail but as far as the offender was concerned he was prepared to continue on making money supplying drug users with drugs, causing them harm as he did so. It was only the intervention of police that led to this harmful operation being shut down.

18The offender's criminal history is remarkably insignificant for a person facing sentence for such serious offences as this. He has some matters for drug possession but his decision that in his late twenties he would set up this drug dealing business can only really be explained by considering the money that could be made from it.

19The offences are all of course closely interrelated and so there will be a significant overlap in the sentences that I will shortly announce. I have applied the principle of totality. In one sense that means that the offender gets much less than he really does deserve, but I have to be careful not to impose a sentence which is crushing given the offender's age and hope that he will be able to rehabilitate himself. 

20I suppose I should make this clear in case anyone wants to review what I've said: it is an element of the offence of ongoing drug supply that there is financial gain. It is not an aggravating circumstance therefore of that offence that he did that for money. I have also taken into account that at times he supplied drugs when his wife and children were home. I regard it as an aggravating circumstance that his two young children would inevitably be exposed to some aspects of what he was doing. It is simply not possible to lock children away when drug users come to the door, certainly not when 140 separate transactions take place over the period of police observation. The fact that the offender would do what he did with his two children in the house says a lot about his attitude towards drug supply. It says a lot about his moral culpability for the sentence which I must sentence him. 

21I will make a finding of special circumstances. It is no longer the case, if it ever was, that the mere fact that this is the offenders first time in custody amounts to special circumstances justifying a variation from the prescribed ratio between non-parole period and the sentence, but in this case, where the offender does profess to have a different attitude towards drugs from that which he displayed leading up to his arrest, and where things such as his work history show that there are prospects for rehabilitation, I am prepared to make a finding in the offender's favour enlarging the period of eligibility for parole. However it has to be said that the variation is but modest. There are two reasons for this, firstly the very length of the sentence I am about to announce provides a substantial period of parole even without such a variation and secondly the effective non-parole period must reflect the objective gravity of what the offender did. I announce sentences as follows:

22For the offence of conducting drug premises, that offence appearing on the s 166 certificate, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of six months to date from the date of the offender's arrest 20 December 2012. For the offence of shortening the firearm also appearing on the s 166 certificate I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of one year also to date from 20 December 2012. For offence of supplying methylamphetamine I impose a fixed term of two years imprisonment to date from 20 June 2013. For the offence of supplying cannabis I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 20 June 2014. For the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to date from 20 June 2014. For the offence of possessing an unauthorised prohibited firearm I impose a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole of two years with a head sentence of four years to date from 20 June 2015. For the offence of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine taking into account the Form 1 matters I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two and a half years with a head sentence of five and a half years to date from 20 June 2016.

23The overall sentence is thus one consisting of an effective non-parole period of six years with a head sentence of nine years. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 20 December 2018.

24I note that the offence of supplying cannabis leaf sequence 3 on the 166 certificate now appears on the indictment. I will dismiss the offence of participating in a criminal group sequence 5 on the 166 certificate. I have sentenced the offender for the offence of conducting drug premises sequence 6 on the 166 certificate. I dismiss the offence of conducting drug premises knowing that a child has access to the premises, sequence 7 on the 166 certificate. I have sentenced the offender for shortening the firearm sequence 8 on the 166 certificate. I dismiss the offence of possessing an unauthorised firearm sequence 9 on the 166 certificate and note that sequence 10 and 13 on the 166 certificate have been taken into account on the Form 1 and I dismiss sequence 14, the offence of possessing a 22 calibre bolt action rifle.

25The money seized by police, $7,400, be forfeited to the Crown.

26If they have not been destroyed, the drugs are to be destroyed. And the final order that I make is that all drug paraphernalia, firearms and ammunition seized by police be forfeited and destroyed.

2763499,New South Wales Crime Commission v Osman [2014] NSWSC 312,"Judgment
1These proceedings commenced on 30 January 2014, naming Tony Osman as a defendant.  An unexplained wealth order was sought against him pursuant to s 28A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, with orders under s 31D that he and another person Mohammed Osman be examined before a registrar of the Court concerning Tony Osman's affairs.  Some other ancillary orders were sought.
2The Plaintiff now applies ex parte by Notice of Motion to amend the proceedings to name Mohammed Osman as a Second Defendant to the proceedings and to ask for restraining orders under s 10A of the Act.  Ancillary orders in relation to those orders are also sought in the Notice of Motion.
3The Notice of Motion is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 20 March 2014.  Mr Spark, who is an ""authorised officer"" as defined in s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that Mohammed Osman has engaged in a serious crime-related activity or serious crime-related activities, being:  the supply of a prohibited drug of an amount larger than or equal to the commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985; supplying a prohibited drug on an ongoing basis contrary to s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act; and supplying a prohibited drug of an amount greater than the indictable quantity contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  Those offences are all ""serious criminal offences"" as defined in s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act.
4The grounds on which Mr Spark holds his suspicion are set out in para 7 of his affidavit.  They consist in chief of Mr Spark's reading of the police fact sheet in relation to charges against Mohammed Osman.  Mr Spark forwarded an email to the named author of the fact sheet to ask him:  if he drafted the fact sheet; if to the best of his knowledge and belief the contents were true and correct; and whether the fact sheet that was prepared was based on information obtained by police as a result of the investigation described in the fact sheet.  The police officer concerned, Constable Liam Daley, replied in the affirmative to those questions.
5I have read the fact sheet.  The matters that are set out in that fact sheet, if proved, are sufficient to show that Mohammed Osman has committed each of the offences charged.
6Mr Spark also annexes to his affidavit a search of the COPS database showing that Mr Mohammed Osman has been charged with the offences that I have referred to. 
7Section 10A(5) of the Act requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.  By reason of what is contained in the fact sheet, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion.
8Mr Spark also suspects that the interest in the property of Tony Osman, the First Defendant, in the Audi motor vehicle is ""serious crime derived property"" within the meaning of s 9 of the Act because of the serious crime-related activity or activities of Mohammed Osman, the Second Defendant. 
9Mr Spark deposes in paragraph 11 of his affidavit to the basis on which he holds his suspicion.  In short, it consists of a number of documents which show purchases of the Audi motor vehicle (said to be the property concerned) together with a statement of an employee of the motor dealer where the Audi was purchased.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that Mr Spark's suspicion in relation to Mr Tony Osman is held on reasonable grounds.
10I am further satisfied, as s 10A(3) requires, from the material annexed to Mr Spark's affidavit that the defendants are domiciled in New South Wales and that the property in respect of which the orders are sought is situated in New South Wales.
11Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the defendants before an order is made if the Court thinks fit.  The First Defendant has filed a notice of appearance on 14 March 2014.  However, no notice has been given to him of the present application.  In the light of Mr Spark's evidence concerning the manner and speed with which property can be disposed of or transferred, I do not consider that either defendant should be given notice of the application before the orders are made.  The defendants have available to them the rights set out in s 10C if they wish to have the orders set aside or varied. 
12I consider in all the circumstances that it is appropriate that leave be given to amend the summons both by adding Mohammed Osman, also known as Mohammed Osmankerin, as well as the other amendments that are proposed to the summons. 13Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages, the giving of which by its solicitor Ms Goh is noted, and considering the matters contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 20 March 2014, I make the orders set out in paras 1 to 4, 6 to 8, 11 and 12 and I grant the leave and liberty set out in paras 5, 9 and 10 of the draft order provided to me.

		24 March 2014",2014-03-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763513,R v Lopez [2014] NSWSC 287,"Judgment
1Carlos Lopez is accused of murdering his mother, Olga Novosadek, his brother, Raul Novosadek and his step-father, Pablo Novosadek on 29 July 2012, at St Johns Park, NSW.
2He is also accused of two offences contrary to s 530(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 of committing an act of serious cruelty and killing two animals, in each case, pet dogs, with the intention of inflicting severe pain.
3Mr Lopez has pleaded not guilty to each of these offences.  
4He has elected to be tried without a jury: s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
5With respect to the three counts of murder (Counts 1, 2 and 3 on the Indictment), both the Crown Prosecutor and senior counsel for Mr Lopez submit that I should return a special verdict in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, of not guilty, upon the basis that Mr Lopez was 
""... mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action, at the time when the act was done ..."".
6With respect to the two counts of animal cruelty (Counts 4 and 5 on the Indictment), the Crown Prosecutor submits that it would be appropriate to return a special verdict, consistently with the verdicts on the three murder counts.  Senior counsel for Mr Lopez submits that I would simply return a verdict of not guilty.  
Trial by Judge Alone
7Where an accused is tried without a jury, s 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act imposes certain obligations upon the judge in reaching a verdict. That section provides:
""(1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such finding has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.(2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied. (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.""
8Section 133(2) requires me to expose in this judgment my reasoning process linking the principles of law with the facts found and justifying the latter and, ultimately, the verdict reached:  Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 197 CLR 250.  This requirement however does not extend to publishing a judgment in the form a summing up would have taken had the trial been before a jury:  R v Winningham (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 May 1995).
9Section 133(3) requires me to set out any requirement on me to give a warning to the jury, had this trial been before a jury, as well as the reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or in consequence of it, I have reached a particular verdict:  Fleming at [28].
Agreed Facts
10The Crown and the accused agreed on all of the relevant facts surrounding the deaths in July 2012.  The full Statement of Agreed Facts became Exhibit A.  What follows is drawn from that statement.
The Initial Scene
11As at July 2012 the accused, Carlos Lopez (aged 44), lived at  St Johns Park with his mother, Olga Novosadek (aged 61) and his brother, Raul Novosadek (aged 43).  His stepfather, Pablo Novosadek (aged 72) resided at 7/28 Park Road Liverpool, although from time to time he visited, or else stayed at the St Johns Park property. 
12At approximately 7.01am on Sunday 29 July 2012, the accused called 000 and identified himself by name. He told the operator that he needed police to attend his residence at St Johns Park.  He told the operator  ""I killed my family"".  The operator asked ""Have you done it or do you plan on doing it?"" He responded ""I've done it.""  The accused then terminated the call. 
13Police from Fairfield attended at premises at St Johns Park.  In a rear bedroom they located the bodies of Olga Novosadek, Pablo Novosadek and Raul Novosadek along with the body of a white dog. The body of another small dog was found in the bathroom. All had been stabbed to death. 
14In another bedroom police located the accused laying in a bed.  He had a wound to his stomach.  He was arrested and transported to Liverpool Hospital for treatment. 
Events Leading up to the Deaths 
15As at 2012, the accused was employed as a general labourer for Brightstar, a supply chain and logistics firm.  He was employed as a temporary full time casual as a fork/lift driver and store person. 
16In 2010 people in contact with the accused became aware that he had developed an interest in aliens, religion and the end of the world.  About April 2010 John Novosadek, the brother of the accused, observed that the accused started to talk about these topics.  
17Once the accused began with this interest, it did not let up and increased.  The accused became overbearing regarding these topics.  Mr John Novosadek recalled that on one occasion the accused told him he had had an extra terrestrial woman come to the house when they were out.  
18Irma Geronimo (a close friend of the late Olga Novosadek) told police that: 
""Around the beginning of 2010, Olga also told me that she was becoming more and more concerned over Carlos. Carlos was talking to Olga and telling her about extra-terrestrials and Carlos had been looking at the internet and looking at websites and she believed he was brain washed by the people that put the information on there.""
19She also told police that:
""Olga realized that he was becoming obsessed with the subjects and it began to annoy Olga and she would call him crazy and tell him to stop talking about it. Olga never at any time said that she was scared of Carlos and never had any concerns that he would hurt her."" 
20The accused's work colleagues were aware of his interest in religion, aliens and the end of the world.  One of his work colleagues told police that, ""Carlos had a weirdness about him"".  People working with him noticed and told her about his mood swings, ""he was happy one day and really withdrawn the next"", ""he would push his religious views on people and believe that the end of the world was coming"".  She said that despite this he was a good worker and employees were happy to have him there, as none of the incidents were violent or threatening. 
21Another work colleague told police that the accused was: 
""Religious and a big believer in conspiracy theories. He would often ask people if they believed in god. He would talk about the stars, and alien life and such things. I noticed that over time he became more open about talking about these things, especially over the last week or two, and I know he believed in a theory that the world was going to end on the 21st December 2012.  
The accused once told him he called himself ""Zioba from Zion"".  He said that on one occasion the accused refused to remove weeds as they were ""living objects"". 
22A supervisor at Brightstar who had a work friendship with the accused, recalls that in 2010 the accused started talking about aliens and religion.  He would say things like ""we are related to aliens and we should respect them"".  The supervisor's view was:
""At times I felt if I didn't agree with him about these issues he would become more aggressive and try to persuade me to believe the same as him.""
23At the beginning of July 2012, the supervisor began to notice a change in the accused, in that: 
""He started talking fast and apologizing to everyone for insignificant things.  He seemed agitated.  During one of our chats at morning tea Carlos said to me he used cocaine and weed in the past, about 3 years ago.  He went on to say he had cleaned himself up now.  He also told he'd had a hard childhood back at home in Argentina.""
24In early July 2012 the accused began telling people he had he had seen angels.  A work colleague told police, 
""One morning ..... he came in and was telling everybody that he had seen an angel the night before, and that they were sitting beside him as he was rapidly typing on the computer in the early hours of the morning.  He was very emotional and intense when he was talking about it."" 
25On Monday 23 July 2013, the accused approached a work colleague and said:
""Sister can I speak with you for a moment?  I have something to tell you. This might be the last time I speak with you as I may not be around much longer.  I just want to tell you who I really am.  My name is Zioba.  I'm a Zionite.  My physical name is Carlos. I'm only here for a short time.""  
26On the same day the accused approached a security guard at his workplace.  They had a conversation, during which the accused said:
""Last night two angels came to me. I could see them from my peripheral vision, they showed so much love and compassion. I have never felt that feeling before."" 
The security guard observed that the accused was starting to cry when he told him this.
27After an incident at work on Thursday 26 July 2012, the accused was asked to leave the premises.  Two work colleagues heard about the incident and attended the premises to speak to the accused.  The accused approached one of them and said ""There is a battle between good and evil and everything will end in December 21st 2012"".  He stated ""We need to look inside ourselves, our souls."" 
28The accused said to the other work colleague: 
""you have love in your heart, you need to have love brother, it's the only way, I'm leaving now there is too many people in there that don't have love in their hearts. They will learn that the end of the world is near I've been send on this earth by god himself. You don't have to understand me brother, the world is going to end."" 
29As a result of the incident, later that afternoon, a work supervisor telephoned the accused to inform him he was not to return to his employment.  During the conversation, the accused said to his supervisor words to the effect of: 
""My soul is now free, I was sent on the earth by god and that god is Zenu who has ruled the earth for more than 13 thousand years.  The world will end on 21st of December with a new moon on 13 December to give us signs.  No one is doing the right thing.  No one has love in their hearts.  Everyone is sinning and doing the wrong thing.  I was sent to the world to solve the worlds problems, I don't expect you to understand because you weren't sent, but I was so I do understand this. My soul is now free. Maybe one day yours will be too.""  
Detailed Account of the Evening of the Deaths 
30At 7.45pm on the night of 28 July 2012 the accused was at home with Olga Novosadek and Raul Novosadek.
31At approximately 7.45pm Olga Novosadek rang her friend Irma Geronimo.  She told police that they spoke until 8.30pm.  Olga told her that she was at home with the accused and Raul. Irma felt that Olga sounded down and questioned her about what was wrong.  Olga responded ""You can't imagine the hell I'm living now"".  Irma asked ""Why""? and she responded ""Carlos"".   She said that he was at home and lowered her voice, she disclosed to Irma ""I'm sick of him. Constantly he comes and hugs me and kisses me, saying that he is all love, he's the light, the extra-terrestrials are here and they are reptilians"".  She detailed: 
""I went with Carlos and Raul to look for a car. Carlos' behaviour at the car yard was shocking, he was talking about this extra-terrestrials things and I was upset. He was touching people and making them turn around and he made me feel very embarrassed, He was telling people he was 'Ziobia' and the war will finish in the end of December and he loves everybody."" 
32Olga stated that she could not take it anymore and that a few days prior she had slapped him and told him ""Stop talking nonsense.""  She said that Carlos responded saying ""I love everybody even my brother Hugo, I love him too"".
33It appears that Pablo Novosadek was out earlier in the evening at a barbeque as Olga informed Irma in the telephone conversation 
""I'm concerned because I lent the car to Pablo and he had to go and cook a barbeque for a soccer club and I know that he drinks and I'm scared he will drive with alcohol.""  
34At some time that evening Pablo returned to Olga's residence. The time of his return is not known. 
35Later that evening Raul Novosadek left and attended Panthers Club on Brisbane Street, St Johns Park. He was driven to the club and later picked up from the club by one of his family members.  This club is approximately a two minute drive from the accused's premises. The Crown case was that Olga picked Raul up from the Club and returned home about 2.30am and that the murders of the family occurred shortly after they returned home.
36At some time during that evening the accused stabbed each of the three deceased to death. 
37Olga Novosadek was lying on the floor on her right hand side at the foot of her bed with her head facing towards the bedroom door.  She was fully clothed. The body of a small dog (the family pet) was located upon her body.  Raul Novosadek was lying face down with his head towards the bedroom window facing away from the bedroom door. He was clothed.  Pablo Novosadek was at the left hand side of the bed with his back against the wardrobe doors and his legs up on the mattress of the bed.  He was dressed only in a pair of black underwear. 
38All three deceased were observed to have multiple stab wounds to their bodies, including the chest, face and back areas.  
39The body of another small dog was located in the bathroom. 
40The precise time that the accused killed his family and the dogs is unknown. 
41The accused at some later stage inflicted wounds to his stomach.  He contacted 000 at 7.01am.  Constable Burrow, Constable Dippert and Constable Jones were among the first to arrive at the scene after responding to the broadcast.  Constable Burrow approached the front door, which was open. The security door was closed. Loud music could be heard coming from within the unit.  Police knocked on the door and called out ""Police"". There was no answer. Looking in they could see red smudge marks that appeared to be blood on the floor.
42The police officers entered the premises and walked along the hallway clearing the living room.  They continued to an open bedroom door at the end of the hallway. They noticed the music was getting louder.  They located the accused inside the room lying on the bed on his back with his face facing the door.  Blood stains were visible on his jumper.  Constable Burrow asked ""Mate are you ok?""  
43The accused lifted his right hand and police observed him to be holding a knife.  He was told to drop the knife.  The accused responded ""Just shoot me.""  Constable Burrow said ""Drop the knife put it on the bed"".  The accused waved the knife around slowly in his right hand.  Police observed he appeared to have blood on his hands.
44Constable Jones moved to clear the house and in so doing located the bodies in the bedroom. 
45Further police arrived.  They assisted Constable Burrow in his attempts to have the accused drop the knife.  After repeated instructions for the accused to drop the knife the accused said again ""Just shoot me"".  Constable Burrow said ""I'm not going to shoot you.  I'm going to Taser you if you don't drop the knife"".  The accused was again repeatedly asked to drop the knife.  Police removed a blanket from him and observed a wound to his chest which was bleeding.
46A police officer deployed his Taser and hit the accused before another police officer struck him on the right wrist to cause him to drop the knife.  The accused was handcuffed, and arrested.
47Whilst outside the front of the premises the accused had a number of conversations with police officers.  He told one police officer that he had killed his family and the dogs ""... to save them"".  He told another police officer that ""... Satan killed them"" and that he was Satan.  
48Shortly after these conversations, ambulance officers arrived.  The accused was then taken to Liverpool Hospital where he was assessed and underwent emergency surgery to repair the stab wound to his stomach. 
Conversations with the Accused at the Hospital 
49On 29 July 2012, Detective Senior Constable Peter Badger was on guard at Liverpool Hospital.  Late in the afternoon the accused regained consciousness and begun making random statements.  He said these words to the police officers: 
""I tried to do the right thing for humanity, but failed"", ""It's all about the vibration of frequency""... ""Satan for 3000 years,.  I became aware Satan was jumping between bodies ... if he did not have a body he did not have a host."" 
50Later that afternoon, the accused said: 
""If we get rid of the darkness there will be peace. That's why I tried to kill myself, I tried to do the right thing for humanity but failed.  Its all about vibration of frequency, Satan for 30,000 years,  I became aware, he, Satan , was jumping between the bodies.  Between Mum, Dad, Raul and the dogs. I thought if he didn't have a body he didn't have a host.  Satan is like a commander, in charge of humans.  And these humans feed off negative energy."" 
51The police officer said to the accused ""What did Satan say?"" The accused said 
""Satan wasn't saying nothing.  I wasn't giving him a chance. He was jumping from body to body.  Every living thing is energy. Every time I said Mum, mum I love you.  She would say leave me alone you're crazy. I had a job to do.  To Kill Satan his number is 666. I failed my mission."" 
He said ""Why""?  The accused responded ""I didn't kill Satan. He's inside me now. If he's inside me you're all fucked now."" 
52Early in the evening, after a considerable number of essentially meaningless and nonsensical statements, the accused said to the police officer: 
""All we are you and I is energies, there is no death it is only a transition of energies. My soul comes from Zion and I am a Zionist. I am incarcerated for this reason. But I failed in my mission because I didn't kill myself."" 
Post-mortem Examination of Deceased
53Dr Matthew Orde carried out a post mortem examination on each of the deceased.  He found that the direct cause of death in each case of each of the deceased members of the Novosadek family was multiple stab wounds.  54He observed that some of the injuries to Raul Novosadek and Olga Novosadek to the left arm and hand ""would be in keeping with defensive injuries"".  Dr Orde also determined in each case that a number of significant wounds were inflicted after death.
Factual Conclusions: Murder Charges
55From all of the Agreed Facts, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that, in the early hours of 29 July 2012, Mr Lopez, the accused, stabbed each of his three family members on multiple occasions, thereby causing their deaths.  I am satisfied that he did so, intending to kill each of them.  
56I am satisfied of his intentions beyond reasonable doubt because, first, that is what Mr Lopez told those to whom he spoke after the events, and, secondly, because of the number of stab wounds inflicted on each of his family members, the locations where those stab wounds were inflicted, and the fact that each of the family members sustained defensive wounds, indicating that they resisted the violent attack upon them.  These two features combine to make it plain that the killings occurred at a time when Mr Lopez was acting with the intention of killing each of his family members.
57But for the defence of mental illness to which it will be necessary to come, I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all elements of the offence of murder, in respect of each of the victims, which constitute the first three counts on the indictment, have been proved by the Crown.
58Indeed, senior counsel for Mr Lopez did not submit to the Court that such findings ought not be made, nor did he present any argument which cast any doubt on these being the appropriate findings.
Factual Conclusions: Animal Cruelty
59An analysis of s 530 of the Crimes Act, shows that, in order for a court to convict a person of an offence against the section, it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the three relevant elements are present.  Those three relevant elements are:
(a)that the accused committed an act of serious cruelty on an animal; and
(b)killed the animal, whilst so doing, or else as a consequence of so doing; and
(c)at all times, acted with the intention of inflicting severe pain on the animal.
60It is clear that the offence is one of specific intention, namely to inflict severe pain on the animal.  The offence involves conduct, namely committing an act of serious cruelty on an animal, and a result, namely that the animal is killed, injured or has prolonged suffering occasioned to it.
61There is no doubt, and the Agreed Facts establish that two dogs were stabbed and killed.
62The Crown submitted that the Court could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing caused the death of each of the two dogs, and that stabbing a dog constituted an act of serious cruelty as required by the provision.
63Senior counsel for Mr Lopez did not put these matters in issue, and accepted that the Court could make such findings, beyond reasonable doubt.  I do so.  
64However, senior counsel for Mr Lopez submitted that, particularly in light of the mental illness of Mr Lopez at the time of the conduct, and the evidence of Professor David Greenberg, the Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he stabbed and killed each of the two dogs, Mr Lopez had formed a specific intention to inflict severe pain on each of the dogs.
65The Crown submitted that the Court would infer the presence of such an intention from the acts carried out by Mr Lopez, which caused the death of the dogs.  In essence the Crown submitted that the Court should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that by stabbing each of the dogs, Mr Lopez had the necessary intention to inflict severe pain.  
66It was not in contest that stabbing each of the two dogs would inflict, objectively speaking, severe pain on the animals.  Nor was it in contest, as I have said above, that this constituted an act of serious cruelty.  Nor was it in contest that each of the dogs died at the hands of the accused, Mr Lopez.
67Professor Greenberg was specifically asked about whether, in his expert opinion, at the time of these offences, Mr Lopez was capable of forming a specific intention to cause severe pain to the animals.  
68Professor Greenberg expressed the view that Mr Lopez felt morally justified in doing what he did, at a time when he was suffering not only delusions, but also disorganised thinking.  He said that any intention which Mr Lopez had was based on his delusional belief system.
69In light of the evidence of Professor Greenberg, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he killed the dogs, Mr Lopez had a specific intention of inflicting severe pain on them.  I am abundantly satisfied he intended to kill the dogs.  However, having regard to his mental state, and the need for me to be satisfied that he had the specific intention of inflicting severe pain, I cannot be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt.
70Accordingly, in due course, it will be appropriate to enter a verdict of not guilty with respect to each of these offences which are Counts 4 and 5 on the indictment.
Mr Lopez's History and Mental State
71The mental history and state of Mr Lopez was proved through the expert reports of Dr Richard Furst, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, written on 9 December 2012, and also that of Professor David Greenberg, also an expert forensic psychiatrist, written on 19 October 2013.
72Dr Furst examined Mr Lopez on 10 October 2012, for a period of about 90 minutes.  Professor Greenberg examined Mr Lopez for a similar period on 5 October 2013.  There is no significant disagreement between each of the experts.  The fact that their reports are about 12 months apart, provides the Court with a comprehensive psychiatric account of Mr Lopez since he has been in custody.
73I am satisfied that I should approach the histories provided to the psychiatrists, although principally admitted for the purpose of demonstrating their psychiatric opinions, as evidence of the truth of what the psychiatrists were told: s 60 Evidence Act 1995.
74Mr Lopez was born in February 1968 in Cordoba Province, in Argentina.  He was the eldest of four boys, two of whom are now dead.  His father worked as a chef, and his step-father worked in the construction industry.  He migrated to Australia in 1980 or 1981.
75He attended primary school in Argentina, and then upon arrival in Australia, attended his local high school.  He apparently struggled to adjust to life in Sydney and left school before gaining his School Certificate.  He subsequently worked with his step-father in the construction industry.  His mother, although initially carrying out some paid employment, mostly stayed at home to look after his brother Raul, who, having suffered from a ruptured cerebral aneurism, had been disabled for some significant period of time.
76Mr Lopez has never married and has lived with his mother and brother since being in Australia.
77Mr Lopez provided a history of sexual abuse to both psychiatrists.  The abuse occurred when he was about four or five years old, whilst in Argentina, and consisted of two occasions when he was the subject of anal intercourse at the hands of his 12 year old neighbour.  This has caused ongoing trauma, including nightmares and anxiety.  
78With the exception of the fact that his mother suffered from depression, as did his brother Raul, for which medication was being taken, there is no history of mental illness in Mr Lopez's family so far as he was aware.  It is unclear, since he has no relationship with his biological father, who remains in Argentina, whether his biological father suffers from any psychotic disorder.
79Mr Lopez has taken drugs since he was aged 14 years old.  He commenced smoking cannabis at that time, and by his early 20s he was smoking cannabis on a daily basis.  This continued regularly up until he was arrested.  Occasionally, there would be periods of time when he ceased his cannabis use.  
80As well, Mr Lopez has used other drugs, including heroin, on one occasion, amphetamines, cocaine and ecstasy.  He commenced to drink alcohol at the age of 18, and by his early 20s he was binge drinking up to 24 beers on a weekend.  As a consequence of this level of drinking, he has had alcoholic blackouts and alcoholic shakes.
81From a time, about two and half to three years prior to his arrest, Mr Lopez had been hearing voices.  The first such episode, as described to Dr Furst, occurred whilst he was sleeping.  He heard a voice saying ""Carlos, wake up"".  He remembers opening his eyes and seeking a figure on top of him like a ""dark shadow"".  He said ""that figure was like a chimpanzee trying to scratch my chest.  I stood up and jumped out of the window"".  
82He told Dr Furst that he interpreted the experience as a ""visit from inter-dimensional extraterrestrials, which were demons of a negative nature"".  He regarded this incident as a form of an epiphany, which led him to the realisation that ""... we are not alone in the universe"".  He commenced to research information about unidentified flying objects (""UFO""), angels, aliens and extraterrestrials.  He became pre-occupied with UFOs and extraterrestrial life, which preoccupation led him to recall an incident about 20 years earlier when he saw a bright object in the sky when two sets of clouds parted, which he now interpreted as being a UFO.  
83Such was his addiction to research on the topics of his pre-occupation, mainly on the internet, specifically on YouTube, that he would only sleep about three and a half hours per night, even though he was fulfilling full-time employment as a forklift driver.  
84In the course of his research, Mr Lopez came to believe that the world would come to an end on 21 December 2012.  He researched this doomsday prophecy on the internet.  Apparently, according to what he told Professor Greenberg, the date of 21 December 2012 was a well-known date in the Mayan Calendar.  
85Such was his addiction, and obsession with these topics, that his mother confided to a friend that she believed that Mr Lopez had been brainwashed by advocates of extraterrestrial beings.  She told her friend that ""Carlos was still talking about God, love, peace and aliens and it was driving her mad"".
86In addition to the history provided by Mr Lopez, Professor Greenberg referred to a number of the passages in the Agreed Facts upon which he placed reliance.  I will shortly summarise those matters here.  
87Mr Lopez's interest in religions, aliens, extraterrestrials and the end of the world, became apparent to his work colleagues.  They observed that he would push his views onto his fellow workers, he expressed strongly his belief that the world was coming to an end and that, although he was a good worker, and was not in any way violent or threatening, he was observed to have significant mood swings.  At one stage he told one of his fellow workers that he was actually called ""Zioba from Zion"".  He also expressed the view that it was wrong to remove weeds from the ground as they were living objects. 
88By July 2012, the accused's behaviour at work and towards his work colleagues had become more erratic.  One of his fellow workers observed that the accused seemed to have started to talk very fast, he was apparently agitated, and was constantly apologising to people for insignificant things.  
89At about that time, Mr Lopez began to tell his fellow workers that he had seen angels during the night, sitting beside him as he was ""rapidly typing on the computer"".  He became very emotional and intense whilst talking about these things.  He confessed to his fellow workers of not having had much sleep, and generally behaved in a way which caused his fellow workers a significant degree of concern.
90As a result of this erratic behaviour, his employment was terminated.  
91When his employer called Mr Lopez to inform him of his ultimate termination as an employee, Mr Lopez spoke to his employer using the following words:
""... my soul is now free, I was sent on the Earth by God and that God is Zenu, who has ruled the Earth for more than 13,000 years.  The world will end on 21 December, with a new moon on 13 December to give us signs.  No one is doing the right thing.  No one has love in their hearts.  Everyone is sinning and doing the wrong thing.  I was to the world to solve the world's problems, I don't expect you to understand because you weren't sent, but I was, I do understand this.  My soul is no free.  Maybe one day, yours will be too.""
92The psychiatrists were of the opinion that some insight into Mr Lopez's mental state could also be gained from conversations which he had after the events in question, together with actions which he took.  I have reviewed the substance of the conversations earlier in this judgment and also his attempt prior to telephoning 000 to kill himself.  
Expert Opinion
93When he was interviewed by Dr Furst, he gave this account of the killing of his family.  He said:
""... that he stabbed his brother in the heart, only to see the inter-dimensional being jump from his brother to his mother, into his step-father and then into the two dogs.  He said 'I was chasing these negative beings.  I thought I was doing the right thing for humanity.  I thought if I could release them from my family I would protect society.  It was like a haze ... a dream.  The music on the radio was spurring me on'. ""
94When interviewed by Professor Greenberg, Mr Lopez told him that he had limited recall of the events surrounding the killing of his family.  Professor Greenberg records the history which he obtained from Mr Lopez in these terms:
""Mr Lopez claims that he does recall that he believed that he could not protect his family from the 'inter-dimensional demons' and 'negative beings'.  He claims that these demons were like shadows and they possess a person by sending 'negative vibes' into the person.  He claims that he believed at that time that when these inter-dimensional beings inhabit a person's body, and the person then gets all negative energy.  He claims that the aliens 'feed off the person with negative energy'. ""
95He told Professor Greenberg that he could not stop himself from undertaking the acts killing his family members and the two dogs.  He repeated to Professor Greenberg that he felt that he had to protect them.  He specifically said ""I felt I was doing the right thing to protect them"".
96Dr Furst in his report, expressed the following expert opinion:
""Mr Lopez presents as a 44 year old male who has a history of untreated psychotic symptoms of about 3 years duration, mostly involving a preoccupation with extra terrestrial life, 'inter-dimensional beings', and religiose attributions to those 'beings'.  He appears to have spent increasing amounts of time researching UFOs and similar themes on the internet, to the point that he was obsessed and paranoid.  His behaviour at work deteriorated, with an apparent dramatic decompensation 2 weeks before the offences in question ... that led to his employment being terminated.  
He appears to have developed overwhelming delusional beliefs and thought he and his family were being attacked by 'inter-dimensional beings of a negative nature'.  He also heard two 'gun shots' which were probably auditory hallucinations reinforcing his beliefs.
...
He apparently saw the 'inter-dimensional being' jump from his brother to his mother, into his step-father and then into the two dogs, making it likely he experienced visual hallucinations.
In my opinion Mr Lopez was labouring under a defect of reason in the form of paranoid and religiose delusions that involved his family, their dogs and himself.  He also had symptoms of both auditory and visual hallucinations and delusions of reference.  He was suffering from the acute phase of paranoid schizophrenia at the time, which had probably been present for 3 years leading up to the offence, and is still present in residual form at the current time.
Schizophrenia has been recognised at law as a disease of the mind.  He was aware of his actions but believed they were morally justified to protect his family and society at large.  He was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sensible composure.""
97Professor Greenberg expressed this opinion:
""Mr Lopez has a Paranoid Schizophrenic Disorder.  He appears to have gradually developed a systemized, religioused and paranoid over valued belief system about UFOs, aliens and 'inter-dimensional beings' over a period of approximately 3 years prior to the alleged offences.  This culminated in an episode of psychosis with systemised and religioused paranoid delusions; at times he may have experienced auditory hallucinations; and he has presented with grossly disorganised behaviour at the time of the offences. 
...
I am of the opinion that Mr Lopez was suffering from a mental illness (disease of the mind), namely, a paranoid schizophrenic disorder at the time of the alleged offences.  I am of the opinion that his use of cannabis may have exacerbated or aggravated his delusional belief system at the time of the offence.  I am of the opinion that in view of the duration and intensity of the psychotic symptoms, his diagnosis is not that of a drug induced psychosis, although his use of drugs likely played a significant role in the precipitation or the onset of the psychosis.  I am of the opinion that Mr Lopez is suffering from a schizophrenic disorder.  At the time of the offences, he reportedly presented bizarre, systemised, religioused, grandiose and spiritual delusions.  He also presented with grossly disorganised behaviour, and possibly had auditory hallucinations.  
...
I am of the opinion that at the time of the alleged offences, Mr Lopez was labouring under a defect of reason caused by a disease of the mind.  Mr Lopez believed that 'inter-dimensional beings' had invaded his family members bodies, and he stabbed these family members and two family dogs to save them and protect them from being invaded and hosted by these negative, inter-dimensional beings.  
I am of the opinion that Mr Lopez did not know the nature and quality of his actions at that time period.  There was a malfunction of capacity for rational thought at that time period.
I am of the opinion that at the time period of the alleged offences, Mr Lopez did not know that his actions were wrong.  He believed that he was morally justified in his actions because he was trying to protect and save his family members from these inter-dimensional beings'. ""
98I accept the expert opinions of Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg.  Neither party submitted that I should not.
99However, I should say that I have formed the opinion that both of these experts have undertaken their task diligently and thoroughly.  Their opinions are unqualified and seem to me to be properly based upon the material which they had.  As well, the opinions accord with the inexpert and untutored view which I would have reached as a matter of common sense.
100As the tribunal of fact I am not bound by the opinion of any expert witness or any number of expert witnesses.  However, this is a circumstance in which the expert witness engaged by the Crown, and whose evidence was not challenged by the accused, and the expert witness called by the defence, agree with each other.  In those circumstances I should not reject the unanimous opinions of the expert witnesses unless there is evidence before me which would cast doubt on those opinions:  R v Huy Pham [2007] NSWSC 1313 at [42] per James J; R v Coles [2008] NSWSC 682 at [9] per Michael Grove J.
Should a Special Verdict be Found?
101The issue to which I now turn my attention is whether that mental illness which I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt existed, was sufficient to satisfy the legal tests to enable a special verdict to be found.
102Before I do so, I note that, had the proceedings been heard in a trial with a jury, there would have been an obligation on me to inform the jury of the legal and practical consequences of a special verdict.  I bear all those matters in mind in considering my verdict in this case.  In particular I note, and have regard to, the following matters:
(a)if my verdict is ""not guilty by reason of mental illness"", I have to decide what should then be done with the accused.  If I am satisfied that neither his safety, nor the safety of any other member of the community is seriously put at risk by his release, I can order his release into the community either unconditionally or on conditions that I believe are necessary for his welfare and that of the community.
(b)if it is not appropriate to release the accused at this point in time, I can make an order that he be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law.  This means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
(c)the composition and functions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, including its obligation to review a case of a forensic patient as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody, its obligation to review the patient at least once every six months, and its obligation not to release a forensic patient unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. 
103The real issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to him the defence of mental illness.  The defence is a matter for the accused to establish, not beyond reasonable doubt, but on the balance of probabilities:  Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659.  If the accused does establish the defence of mental illness, then a special verdict is to be returned.  
104Section 38(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides:
""38 Special verdict
(1) If, in an indictment ..., an act ... is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his ... action at the time when the act was done ..., then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act ..., but was mentally ill at the time when the person did ... the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.""
105That section, and the Act, do not provide any definition of the term ""mentally ill"".  The meaning of that term is determined in accordance with the M'Naghten Rules:  R v M'Naughten (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722:  
""Every man is presumed to be sane; and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, unless the contrary is proven ...;  that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.""
106In order to persuade the Court to return a special verdict, it is necessary for Mr Lopez to persuade me, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time he killed his family, he was suffering from a mental illness, which led to a defect of reason such that he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.
107There can be little doubt in this case that Mr Lopez knew the nature and quality of the acts which he was doing to kill his family members.  The evidence discloses that he took a knife, and stabbed each of his three family members intending to kill them.  The number of stab wounds, and the defensive wounds sustained by two of the members of Mr Lopez's family, are an obvious indication of that which he was doing.  It was a brutal, vicious, unconstrained, and ultimately fatal, assault by Mr Lopez on each of his family members.
108When asked to account for his actions, he told police, and ultimately the psychiatric experts, that he intended to kill his family members.  There is simply no doubt that he knew the nature and quality of his act.
109Equally, there is no doubt, based upon the expert evidence and the observations of what he was doing and saying in the three years or so leading up to the killings, and in particular in the days and weeks before, that Mr Lopez was suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness, being paranoid schizophrenia.  Paranoid schizophrenia is an illness recognised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders - 5th Edition, and is well accepted as a mental illness.
110The question then becomes whether, even though Mr Lopez knew the nature and quality of his acts, he has persuaded me on the balance of probabilities that by reason of his mental illness that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  
111I am abundantly satisfied that Mr Lopez did not know what he was doing was wrong.  I am so satisfied because I accept the account of the police officers and others who have interviewed or spoken to Mr Lopez about what happened, who have recorded that he told them that whilst he intended to kill his family, he was doing so in order to protect them.  As well, I have taken into account, and I accept, the expert evidence of Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg that such was the effect of the psychiatric disorder, that Mr Lopez did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  Rather, the effect of the psychiatric disorder was that he thought that what he was doing was right.  
112This issue is raised by the second part of the M'Naughten Rules.  It is necessary here to remind myself of the proper direction which would in substance be given to a jury on this issue.  I do so by reference to legal authority.
113In R v Porter [1933] HCA 1;(1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190, the test was formulated by Dixon J in the course of his summing up to a jury in these terms:
""The other head is of quite a different character, namely, that his disease or disorder or disturbance of mind was of such a character that he was unable to appreciate that the act he was doing was wrong. It is supposed that he knew he was killing, knew how he was killing and knew why he was killing, but that he was quite incapable of appreciating the wrongness of the act. That is the issue, the real question in this case. Was his state of mind of that character? I have used simple expressions, but when you are dealing with the unseen workings of the mind you have to come to close quarters with what you are speaking about, and it is very difficult to be quite clear as to what is meant in describing mental conditions. I have used the expression 'disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind.' That does not mean ... that there must be some physical deterioration of the cells of the brain ... you are dealing with a very different thing - with the understanding. It does mean that the functions of the understanding are through some cause, whether understandable or not, thrown into derangement or disorder.
Then I have used the expression 'know', 'knew that what he was doing was wrong'. We are dealing with one particular thing, the act of killing, the act of killing at a particular time, a particular individual. We are not dealing with right or wrong in the abstract. The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong?  If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.
If you think that at the time when he administered the poison to the child he had such a mental disorder or disturbance or derangement that he was incapable of reasoning about the right or wrongness, according to ordinary standards, of the thing which he was doing, not that he reasoned wrongly, or that being a responsible person he had queer or unsound ideas, but that he was quite incapable of taking into account the considerations which go to make right or wrong, then you should find him not guilty upon the ground that he was insane at the time he committed the acts charged.""
114The terms of this explanation of the second part of the M'Naughten test has been judicially approved: Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 55; (1952) 86 CLR 358; Regina v Matheis (1958) 58 SR (NSW) 321 at 322 per Owen J, Street CJ and Herron J agreeing; R v Matusevich & Thompson [1976] VR 470 at 477 per Young CJ, Starke and NelsonJJ.
115It is appropriate that I regard what Dixon J said as a practical synthesis of the concepts involved, and have regard to it, in undertaking the task which follows.
116I have relied heavily on the expert opinions of Dr Furst and Professor Greenberg.  Both counsel for the Crown, and senior counsel for the accused, submitted that I should accept these opinions, and hence I should be satisfied that Mr Lopez has available to him the defence of mental illness because he did not know, in all of the circumstances, that what he was doing was wrong.
117In all of the circumstances, I consider that I should accept the expert psychiatric evidence and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time he killed each of the three members of his family, the accused, Mr Lopez, did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  Accordingly, he was mentally ill, and a defence under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act has been established.
118The consequence of finding in the accused's favour on the defence of mental illness is that I return a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness.  One possible consequence of that is that the accused could be discharged, either conditionally or unconditionally, into the community.  Neither the Crown, nor senior counsel for Mr Lopez submitted that in all of the circumstances of this case, this would be appropriate.  It clearly would not be appropriate.
119What will happen in this case is that the accused will be detained in custody until he is released by due process of law.  In other words, he will remain in custody and be held as a forensic patient and come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
120In coming to my decision as to the appropriate verdict, I have taken into account the composition and functions of that Tribunal and the fact that the accused will not be released until it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release.  His case will be reviewed by the Tribunal as soon as practicable and, if further detained, his case will be reviewed at six monthly intervals.  If at some stage the accused is released, it may be on conditions that if any of those conditions are breached, or his mental condition deteriorates to a point where he may be a serious danger to others, the Tribunal may order that he be apprehended and further detained. 
121My conclusions are:
(a)I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of the accused Carlos Lopez on 29 July 2012 caused the death of each of Olga Novosadek, Raul Novosadek and Pablo Novosadek.
(b)I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of those killings the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from a disease of the mind that he did not know that what he did was wrong.
Verdict
122I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness with respect to Counts 1, 2 and 3, being offences against s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900.
123In respect of Counts 4 and 5, being offences against s 530 of the Crimes Act 1900, I find the accused not guilty.
Orders
124I make the following orders pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990:
(1)Order that Carlos Lopez be detained at the Psychiatric Ward, Long Bay Prison Hospital, or at such other place as may be determined from time to time by the Mental Health Review Tribunal, until released by due process of law.
(2)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Minister for Health of this judgment and order.
(3)Direct the Registrar of the Court to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of this judgment and order and to provide to that Tribunal the following documentation:
(a)A copy of these reasons for verdict and orders;
(b)A transcript of these proceedings;
(c)A copy of each of the exhibits tendered at the trial.

2763515,Attorney-General of NSW v McGuire (No.2) [2014] NSWSC 288,"Judgment
1By a Summons filed on 9 December 2013, the Attorney-General of NSW seeks an order pursuant to cl 1 of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""MHFP Act""), that Mr McGuire be subject to an extension order for a period of five years.
2At the hearing of the proceedings, the Attorney-General modified the length of that period and sought only an extension order for a period of two and a half years.  
3Mr McGuire opposes the making of any extension order.  
4For the reasons which follow, I have decided that an extension order ought to be made for a period of 12 months.
Mr McGuire becomes a Forensic Patient
5On 17 August 2006, Mr McGuire was charged with three offences contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that he had sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting.  As well, he was charged with one offence of aggravated break and enter, and commit serious indictable offence. 
6On 4 December 2007, he was committed to stand trial with respect to each of these offences in the District Court at Nowra.  
7On 25 August 2008, the District Court at Nowra (Garling DCJ) determined after an inquiry conducted in accordance with the MHFP Act, that on the evidence before the Court, Mr McGuire was not fit to be tried, and he was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"").  Mr McGuire, who was then in custody, was remanded in custody.
8It is clear that the basis upon which Mr McGuire was found unfit to be tried, was that he suffered from an intellectual disability which meant that, together with poor language skills, he was unable to understand the charges with which he was confronted, and was unable to instruct lawyers rationally with respect to his version of the facts, and what defences can or should be raised.  It was also clear that he would not understand adequately the nature of the proceedings to which he was subject.  
9In August and September 2009, the District Court held a special hearing pursuant to the provisions of the MHFP Act.  On 4 September 2009, for the reasons which she then expressed, Murrell DCJ, held that in respect of the three counts of sexual intercourse without consent, on the limited evidence available to her, Mr McGuire committed each of the offences charged.  Her Honour permanently stayed the fourth charge of aggravated break and enter as an abuse of process.  Her Honour's reasons are to be found at R v McGuire [2009] NSWDC 245.
10On 4 September 2009, pursuant to s 23(1)(b) of the MHFP Act, in respect of each of the three offences her Honour nominated a limiting term of four years.  In respect of the first of the three offences, her Honour nominated the limiting term to commence on 1 January 2009.  In respect of the other two offences, her Honour nominated the limiting term to commence on 1 January 2010.  The effect of this was Mr McGuire was subject to an overall effective limiting term of five years, which would expire on 31 December 2013.  
11Having nominated a limiting term, Murrell DCJ was obliged by s 24 of the MHFP Act to refer Mr McGuire to the Tribunal and also to make an order with respect to his custody.  She did so.  
12Thereafter, Mr McGuire was detained in custody, in a correctional facility and, by reason of the provisions of s 42 of the MHFP Act, he became a forensic patient subject to regular review by the Tribunal.  
13On 26 August 2013, the Tribunal, pursuant to the provisions of s 47(1)(b) of the MHFP Act, released Mr McGuire into the community subject to a comprehensive set of conditions.
14By reason of the expiration of the limiting term on 31 December 2013, Mr McGuire's status as a forensic patient would have ceased.  However, on 12 December 2013, Davies J made an interim extension order under cl 10 of Sch 1 to the MHFP Act, which extended Mr McGuire's status as a forensic patient from 31 December 2013 for a period of 28 days.  Other Judges of the Court have subsequently renewed this interim order, so that it will now expire on 25 March 2014.  
15On 4 and 5 March 2014, the Court held a final hearing dealing with the Summons filed by the Attorney-General.  It is necessary that judgment be delivered prior to 25 March 2014 because interim extension orders cannot be further renewed after that date: cl 11 Sch 1 MHFP Act.
Mr McGuire's Background
16Mr McGuire was born on 11 November 1972 in Ballarat in Victoria.  He was the youngest of nine children.  
17In the late 1970's the family moved to NSW, ultimately to Department of Housing accommodation at Mt Druitt.  Mr McGuire began school whilst living in NSW.  He attended Shalvey High School and was expelled for truancy in Year 8.  During his period of time at school he had been involved in physical confrontation with other students.
18After leaving school, he remained living at home helping his father with the collection of scrap metal.  When he was 17, he left home and moved in with his sister, and worked as a painter's labourer.  He was sacked from this job for absenteeism.  
19He then moved to Young where his parents were living and there worked as a casual fruit picker.  In the early 1990s, he met his former partner in Young and they lived together for about two years.  Some time during 1993 or 1994, the precise date is unclear and of no particular moment, he and his former partner had a daughter.
20He apparently met his former partner at the TAFE College at Young where he was enrolled in a literacy course.  After the termination of the relationship in Young, he moved to Richmond and resided with his brother.
21His criminal record commenced when he was about 24 years old.  He was first convicted in the Local Court for breach of an apprehended violence order and malicious damage  
22Thereafter his criminal record consists of quite serious driving offences, including driving in a manner dangerous and offences of violence including assault and petty larceny.  
23In December 2003, he was charged with driving whilst under the influence of alcohol and driving his vehicle in a reckless or furious way at a speed or manner dangerous to the public.  For these offences he was imprisoned for 12 months, with a 9 month non-parole period.
24In February 2005, he was again charged with driving his vehicle in a reckless or furious way at a speed or manner dangerous to the public, and driving whilst disqualified together with a number of other driving offences.  For these offences, he was sentenced to a total of 12 months imprisonment commencing in February 2005, with a non-parole period of 9 months.  He first became eligible for release on 4 November 2005.  
25Just over four months after his release from imprisonment, he committed the Index Offences.  
The Index Offences
26According to the Court Attendance Notice, each of the three offences against s 61 I of the Crimes Act, were committed between 4.30pm and 5.20pm on 4 April 2006 at Nowra.  The charges are in identical form, and, save for the victim's name which I have anonymised, read this way:
""Crimes Act 1900, Section 61 I - IS 
Sexual intercourse without consent between 4.30pm and 5.20pm on 04/04/2006 at Nowra.  That Herbert Robert McGuire on 4th April 2006, at Nowra, in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with [XX], without her consent and knowing that [XX] had not consented to sexual intercourse.""
27Since these three offences were the ones in respect of which limiting terms were fixed, I will refer to them as the index offences.
28Mr McGuire was first apprehended in respect of the index offences shortly after lunchtime on 17 August 2006.  However, it seems that he remained on bail until October 2007, when he was taken into custody with respect to the other matters.  He was in custody when the index offences were dealt with by the District Court at Nowra.  
29In her Reasons, delivered at the conclusion of the special hearing, Murrell DCJ recorded the circumstances of the offences which she was satisfied had been committed by Mr McGuire.  She said that but for Mr McGuire's intellectual disability, there was little doubt that each of the offences would be categorised as falling in the upper mid or high range of objective seriousness because they occurred in the victim's home, they involved the use of violence and they occurred in the presence of the victim's child.
30She described the circumstances in the following way: 
""21. At about midday on 4 April 2006 the accused went to premises adjacent to the complainant's residence.  In the period until about 4.30 or 5p.m. he drank with two acquaintances, consuming least eight stubbies [of] beer and probably more.  In the course of the afternoon, the accused observed the complainant in the next-door premises and said words to the effect of 'she would be all right for a girlfriend'.  He became somewhat intoxicated and at one stage was 'nodding off'.  When he left the premises he was 'a little bit intoxicated' but was 'not overly drunk' and was capable of walking.  He saw a cat and was told that it belonged to the complainant.  He picked up the cat and walked in the direction of the complainant's residence.
22. It was the complainant's evidence that a man (who must have been the accused) appeared on her front porch and asked to come in for a drink.  According to the complainant's police statement 'he spoke of wanting to be with (the complainant) and wanting to be (her) friend'.  The complainant refused the request to come into her house.  The man was drinking a stubbie of beer.  Later, the police seized an empty stubbie from the complainant's front porch.  It was found to contain the accused's DNA.
23. The accused went to the side of the house and then to the backyard, where he played with the complainant's young daughter.  The complainant removed washing from the line and took it into the house.  The complainant's daughter came into the house, followed by the accused.  The complainant asked the accused to leave the house but he refused to do so.  The complainant walked to the front of the house, successfully enticing the accused out of the house.  The complainant went back inside, securing the latch on the front screen door.  She went to the kitchen to locate a key so that she could lock the front screen door.
24. When the complainant was standing in her living room, the accused grabbed her by the arms and told her to be quiet.  He put a hand over her mouth.  The complainant bit the accused on the hand.  The complainant found herself lying on her back on the floor.  The accused pulled his pants down to his knees and pulled her pants down, possibly to her knees, and proceeded to have penile/vaginal intercourse, causing the complainant to feel some pain.  The complainant estimate that the intercourse continued for between five and fifteen minutes.  The complainant was struggling.  She managed to get onto her hands and knees and reached for the telephone, intending to dial for assistance.  However, she discovered that the lead had become disconnected.  She hit the accused over the head with the telephone.  He was undeterred.  She began to search for her mobile telephone.  As she was doing so, the accused commenced penile/anal intercourse, which continued for five to ten minutes.  The complainant believes that the accused did not ejaculate.
25. The complainant found herself with her back to the floor.  The accused 'tried it again'.  It was the complainant's evidence that the accused put his penis back into her vagina 'quite a few times'.  'Almost immediately' that the accused 'tried it again' the complainant succeeded in yanking his penis.  It was soft  After words were exchanged, the accused left, saying that he would 'come back next week to finish the job'.
26. The complainant dressed, comforted her daughter and called the police.""
31Because the fourth offence of breaking and entering involved the same circumstances as those included in the first offence of sexual intercourse without consent, her Honour was satisfied that as all of the elements of Count 4 were wholly included in Count 1, and because she had returned a verdict on the first offence before considering the fourth offence, that it was an abuse of process to proceed to make any finding with respect to the fourth offence.  In the exercise of her Honour's inherent discretion, she permanently stayed the proceedings on the fourth offence of aggravated break and enter:
""... because the entry of a verdict on Count 4 would entail two adverse findings in relations to the same conduct.""
The Relevant Legislation
32Because Mr McGuire is a forensic patient, the basis for the making of the order sought by the Attorney-General is to be found in the MHFP Act.  
33A forensic patient is defined for the purposes of the MHFP Act in s 42.  That definition is in the following form:
""42 Forensic patients
For the purposes of this Act, the following persons are ""forensic patients"" :
(a) a person who is detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place, or released from custody subject to conditions, pursuant to an order under:(i) section 14, 17 (3), 24, 25, 27 or 39, or(ii) section 7 (4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (including that subsection as applied by section 5AA (5) of that Act),(a1) a person in respect of whom an extension order or interim extension order is in force,(b) a person who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section. ""
34Because Mr McGuire was the subject of a limiting term, and was detained in custody pursuant to an order made under s 24 of the MHFP Act, Mr McGuire was a forensic patient.  Because, since 1 January 2014, he is a person in respect of whom an interim extension order is in force, he continues as a forensic patient, until at least 24 March 2013.
35It is relevant to note the provisions of s 43 of the MHFP Act.  It is in the following form:
""43 Criteria for release and matters to be considered by Tribunal
The Tribunal must not make an order for the release of a forensic patient unless it is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that:
(a) the safety of the patient or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the patient's release, and(b) other care of a less restrictive kind, that is consistent with safe and effective care, is appropriate and reasonably available to the patient or that the patient does not require care.""
36Section 54A of the MHFP Act provides for the extension of the status as a forensic patient for a person providing that it is done in accordance with Sch 1.  
37Schedule 1 of the MHFP Act is in the following form:
""SCHEDULE 1 - Extension of status as forensic patient
Part 1 - Extension of status as forensic patient
1 Extension orders for forensic patients
(1) The Supreme Court may, on application under Part 2 of this Schedule, make an order for the extension of a person's status as a forensic patient.(2) An order made under this clause is an ""extension order"".
2 Forensic patients in respect of whom extension orders may be made
(1) forensic patient can be made the subject of an extension order as provided for by this Schedule if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that:(a) the forensic patient poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he or she ceases being a forensic patient, and(b) the risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means (including classification as an involuntary patient under section 53).(2) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person causing serious harm to others is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.
Part 2 - Extension orders
Division 1 - Application for extension order
....
5 Requirements with respect to application
An application for an extension order must be supported by documentation:
(a) that addresses each of the matters referred to in clause 7 (2) (to the extent relevant to the application), and(b) that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner):(i) that assesses the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others, and(ii) that addresses the need for ongoing management of the patient as a forensic patient and the reasons why the risk of the forensic patient causing serious harm to others cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means.
...
Division 2 - Determination of application
7 Determination of application for extension order
(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application under this Part for an extension order:(a) by making the order, or(b) by dismissing the application.(2) In determining whether or not to make an extension order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:(a) the safety of the community,(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under clause 6 (5) to conduct examinations of the forensic patient,(c) the report of the qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided under clause 5 (b),(d) any other report of a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner provided in support of the application or by the forensic patient,(e) any order or decision made by the Tribunal with respect to the forensic patient that is relevant to the application,(f) any report of the Director-General of the Ministry of Health, the Commissioner of Corrective Services, the Director-General of the Department of Family and Community Services or any other government Department or agency responsible for the detention, care or treatment of the forensic patient,(g) the level of the forensic patient's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while a forensic patient (including while released from custody subject to conditions and while on a leave of absence in accordance with section 49 or 50),(h) the views of the court that imposed the limiting term or existing extension order on the forensic patient at the time the limiting term or extension order was imposed,(i) any other information that is available as to the risk that the forensic patient will in future cause serious harm to others.(3) If the Supreme Court makes an extension order in respect of a forensic patient, the Court is to notify the Tribunal of the making of the order.
8 Term of extension order
(1) An extension order:(a) commences when it is made, or when the limiting term or existing extension order to which the forensic patient is subject expires, whichever is the later, and(b) expires at the end of the period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) that is specified in the order.(2) Nothing in this clause prevents the Supreme Court from making a second or subsequent extension order against the same forensic patient.
...
Division 4 - General
12 Extension order or interim extension order may be varied or revoked
(1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke an extension order or interim extension order:(a) on the application of a Minister administering this Act or the forensic patient, or(b) on the recommendation of the Tribunal under section 47 (2A).(2) The period of an order must not be varied so that the total period as varied is greater than that otherwise permitted under this Part.(3) Without limiting the grounds for revoking an extension order or interim extension order, the Supreme Court may revoke an extension order or interim extension order if satisfied that circumstances have changed sufficiently to render the order unnecessary.""


38Part 5 of the MHFP Act deals with how forensic patients are to be overseen by the Tribunal, and how they are to be cared for, including by the making of community treatment orders.  The objects of Part 5 are set out in s 40 in the following terms:
""40 Objects
The objects of this Part are as follows:
(a) to protect the safety of members of the public,(b) to provide for the care, treatment and control of persons subject to criminal proceedings who are suffering from a mental illness or mental condition,(c) to facilitate the care, treatment and control of any of those persons in correctional centres through community treatment orders,(d) to facilitate the provision of hospital care or care in the community through community treatment orders for any of those persons who require involuntary treatment,(e) to give an opportunity for those persons to have access to appropriate care."" 
39In determining any application for an extension order, the Court is obliged to give attention to the provisions of Division 2 of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act, the relevant clauses of which have been set out above.

40Once an extension order has been made, the order may at any time be varied or revoked by the Supreme Court: cl 12 Sch 1 of MHFP Act.  Although the grounds are limited for revoking an extension order, one ground is that if the Supreme Court is satisfied that circumstances have changed ""sufficiently to render the order unnecessary"", it may be revoked: cl 12(3) of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act.
41As well, in the event that the Court does make an extension order, or if a court refuses to make such an order, then there is a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal: cl 14 of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act.
Applicable Legal Authorities
42The legislation is substantially similar to, and mirrors very closely, the regime in the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (""HRO Act"").  
43The HRO Act deals with two categories of offenders: high-risk sex offenders, and high-risk violent offenders.  The Supreme Court is given the power to make continuing detention orders, or extended supervision orders, with respect to both categories of offenders.
44The principal test to be applied to each of these categories of offenders is whether the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing either a serious sex offence (for high-risk sex offenders) or else a serious violence offence (for high-risk violent offenders) if the offender is not kept under supervision.
45In the relevant provisions of the MHFP Act, the Supreme Court also has to be satisfied to a high degree of probability when considering making an extension order.  As well, the concept of unacceptable risk is also used.  However, the risk is not expressed as one of committing an offence, but rather as an ""... unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others"", if the person ceases to be a forensic patient.
46Since these two concepts use identical phrases, an examination of previously decided cases relating to the HRO Act is a useful guide to the application of the same or substantially similar phrases in the MHFP Act.  
47The first phrase to be considered is ""high degree of probability"".  In Cornwall v Attorney-General for NSW [2007] NSWCA 374 at [21], the Court (Mason P, Giles and Hodgson JJA) said:
""The expression 'a high degree of probability' indicates something 'beyond more probably than not', so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt ...""
48In the circumstances here, the applicant for the order, namely the Attorney-General, carries this onus of proof and persuasion.  
49The second phrase to be considered is ""unacceptable risk"".  A similar expression was considered by the West Australian Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASCA 206; (2007) 35 WAR 297 where at [63], Wheeler JA said with respect to the same expression in legislation broadly corresponding to the HRO Act, this:
""In my view, an 'unacceptable risk' ... is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to the variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted), and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists.  That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.""
50The West Australian Court of Appeal considered the matter again in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; (2008) 38 WAR 307 at [27] where Steytler P and Buss JA said:
""The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the Court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). ...""
51In NSW the HRO Act was considered in State of NSW v Thomas [2011] NSWSC 118.  There R A Hulme J considered the application of the phrase ""unacceptable risk"" where he said, at [20]:
""Whilst bearing in mind the second of these two objects, I would regard the test in s 9(2) as being satisfied if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made.""
52R A Hulme J called attention to the objects of the Act there under consideration as the starting point for understanding the legislation.  The position is rather more complicated here, in this statutory regime.
53The reason for this greater complexity is to be found in the breadth of functions to which the MHFP Act is addressed.  Part 2 of the MHFP Act deals with the procedures in a part of the criminal justice system, namely proceedings in the Supreme Court and the District Court.  It applies to people who have a mental disorder, but who are not necessarily mentally ill.  Part 3 applies to criminal proceedings before a Magistrate, other than committal hearings, and also to bail applications.  Part 4 makes provision for the defence of mental illness which may apply to some but not all of the individuals to whom Parts 2 and 3 apply. 
54Part 5 of the MHFP Act, which relates directly to Sch 1, and contains the relevant provisions for extension orders deals with forensic patients, who may or may not be mentally ill, and correctional patients, namely prisoners who have become mentally ill, but are not in mental health facilities and who are not involuntary patients in such facilities.  
55Because of these complexities, it is the objects of Part 5 to which attention must be given.  As earlier indicated, they are set out in s 40.  For a forensic patient such as Mr McGuire, who suffers from an intellectual disability, the only object which appears to be of direct relevance is that set out in s 40(a), namely the protection of the safety of members of the public.
56Accordingly, it is this object to which attention must be given when addressing the balancing exercise discussed in the authorities to which I have earlier referred.  
57Taking into account these authorities and the object of the provisions, and the words of Clause 2 of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act, it seems to me that the balancing exercise required involves the following integers.  On one side of the ledger, the Court needs to consider and assess the nature and extent of the risk of Mr McGuire causing serious harm to others, the likelihood of that risk becoming an actuality, and the possible consequences of serious harm being caused to others upon the assumption that an extension order was not made and upon the assumption that, in the case of Mr McGuire, he is at liberty to live his life as he chooses.
58On the other side of the ledger, the Court needs to assess and consider, having regard to the fact that, but for the making of an interim order Mr McGuire has completed the limiting term fixed by the District Court, Mr McGuire is not presently under any constraint on his liberty, and ought as a matter of the norms of a democratic society, be allowed to live his life in a way which enables him to exercise such liberty like any other member of society.
59The exercise of balancing these two sides of the ledger, and considering the result, is to be done to further the relevant objects of the legislation namely, to protect the safety of the community generally.  The exercise results in an evaluation of whether the risk is an acceptable one or not.  In other words, notwithstanding that Mr McGuire has completed the punishment imposed on him by serving his limiting term, largely in custody, can the community be protected, not completely, but to an adequate or reasonable degree, if an order is not made?
60The remaining element to be considered is that described in Clause 2(1)(b) of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act.  This requires that the Court, even if satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm, to then be satisfied to a high degree of probability, that this unacceptable risk cannot be adequately managed by other less restrictive means.
61Curiously, although not applicable to Mr McGuire who is neither mentally ill nor mentally disordered, as those terms are defined in the Mental Health Act, Cl 2 suggests that classifying a person as an involuntary patient is regarded as a less restrictive means of adequately managing them, than the making of an extension order.  
62It is also hard to see that if a risk can be adequately managed by a less restrictive means than continuing a person's status as a forensic patient, a Court could ever be satisfied that the risk is an unacceptable one.  Nevertheless, the legislation requires the Court to approach the matter by considering, once it is satisfied that an unacceptable risk exists, whether adequate management by other less restrictive means, exists.  The question to be determined here is expressed in terms that require the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the risk cannot be adequately managed.
63I would take the use of the phrase ""adequately managed"" to mean that the unacceptable risk is mitigated by the proposed management regime so that the community's interest in being kept safe is outweighed by the community's interest in not having mentally ill or mentally disordered individuals or forensic patients being confined in some form of institutional care rather than taking their place in the community.  
64The notion that mentally ill individuals ought receive their treatment in the community is well recognised by the community and is entrenched in the Mental Health Act: s 12, s 38, s 53 and, in particular, s 68.  However, the position is novel with respect to a forensic patient who is not mentally ill, or mentally disordered, but as is the case here, a person with an intellectual disability.
65Despite the novelty of the position, it is appropriate to approach this matter by attempting to give effect to the rather curiously expressed provisions contained in Sch 1 of the MHFP Act.  
Mr McGuire's Time as a Forensic Patient
66Since being in custody as a forensic patient, Mr McGuire has been held either at the Goulburn Correctional Centre, or else at the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre.  As a forensic patient, Mr McGuire has been reviewed by the Tribunal from time to time.  
67In February 2010, Mr McGuire was referred to the Aging, Disability and Homecare Agency (""the ADHC""), which was establishing services for people with an intellectual disability who were leaving correctional facilities.  This was being done through its Community Justice Program (""CJP"").  
68According to the ADHC, through the CJP, an individual could receive accommodation and behaviour support services designed to assist their transition to community living and reduce their risk of re-offending.  
69About February 2010, the Tribunal was provided with a psychiatric report by Dr Matthew Hearps, a consultant psychiatrist, who expressed the following opinion:
""Mr McGuire's pre-eminent feature is cognitive impairment, consistent with his diagnosed intellectual disability.
There is not evidence that Mr Mr McGuire has a psychotic or mood disorder.  There was not sufficient evidence, on today's assessment, to make a diagnosis of paraphilia.
In terms of fitness, in my view, were the question of Mr McGuire's fitness to be redetermined, he would like again be found unfit to be tried.
The treatment recommendations are: 
(1) Assessment of Mr McGuire's risk of sexual re-offending, and assessment with a view to participation in a custodial sex offender program.  This assessment can be undertaken by DCS Sexual and Violent Offenders Program.  
(2) Assessment by the Community Justice Program (and agency of Aging Disability and Homecare, Department of Health Services) - with a view to risk assessment, placement and risk management for Mr McGuire, once he is released to the community. ...
(3) While Mr McGuire continues in custody, his present placement in 5-Wing appears to be appropriate, given his intellectual disability and his consequent vulnerability.""
70In August 2010, the ADHC indicated that it was engaged in assessing Mr McGuire and nominated three possible accommodation models which may be considered.  They were:
(a)an intensive residential support model which is a high level supported environment, which usually provides a single level property with a 24/7 staffing establishment and access to targeted interventions;
(b)an on-site supported living model which provides a range of support options but is generally suitable for individuals with a greater capacity for increased independence.  That model is able to provide the individual with up to 24/7 access to support staff and could be implemented in a variety property types;
(c)drop in support which provided a flexible drop-in service to individuals who require specific support and intervention.  It was described as covering a range in terms of hours and may be delivered to an individual in a private or Department of Housing property, family home or shared accommodation setting.
71On 3 December 2010, the Guardianship Tribunal made a financial management order pursuant to the Guardianship Act 1987 which placed the management of Mr McGuire's financial affairs under the control of his sister.  The Guardianship Tribunal expressed itself satisfied that Mr McGuire was incapable of managing his financial affairs.
72On 10 March 2011, Mr McGuire was reviewed by the Tribunal which determined that it was appropriate to continue Mr McGuire's detention at the Goulburn Correctional Centre.  The reasons for the Tribunal's decision indicate that Mr McGuire had been transferred to the Additional Support Unit of the Goulburn Correctional Centre because his classification had changed.  His behaviour had been assessed as entirely satisfactory.  He was working on a regular basis, assisting in the refurbishment of portable demountable school classrooms.  There were no structured programs available to him.  There was no suggestion that he had imbibed any alcohol or taken any illicit drugs.
73The Tribunal in its reasons expressed this conclusion:
""The Tribunal was satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that care, treatment and control of Mr McGuire is necessary for his own protection from serious harm and the protection of others from serious harm.  Mr McGuire has a diagnosis of intellectual disability, and does not have a diagnosed mental illness.  The CJP have now accepted Mr McGuire and have prepare a comprehensive plan which emphasises the kind of support that can be offered to Mr McGuire on release.  However, appropriate assessments in respect of risk of harm to himself or others if released, at present has not yet occurred. ...
Mr McGuire appeared at the hearing to be somewhat surprised that he was not going to be released by the Tribunal on the day of the hearing, and it was explained to him that the Tribunal was unable to make such a decision unless it formed the view, after proper assessment, that he would not pose a risk of serious danger to himself or others.  The Tribunal, at this stage has not been provided with a comprehensive Risk Assessment Report or any firm information as to what, if any, interventions could usefully take place before the expiry of Mr McGuire's limiting term, or indeed in the community if his release to the community by way of conditional release became appropriate.  Such evidence is vital to the Tribunal's consideration of conditional release.  Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr McGuire should remain detained at the correctional centre.""
74For reasons which do not appear in the evidence before the Court, although the hearing of the Tribunal was conducted on 10 March 2011, the reasons for its decision were not finalised and published until six months later, on 12 September 2011.  
75Meanwhile, on 23 August 2011, an extensive Risk Assessment and Management Report was prepared by the NSW Community Forensic Mental Health Service, which made particular recommendations as to Mr McGuire's treatment and supported his placement in the community in principle, but not if he were to be placed in independent accommodation.  It recommended that Mr McGuire's future community placement consider supported accommodation options, which had a capacity for high levels of supervision, routine and structure.
76The Tribunal undertook a further review of Mr McGuire on 6 September 2011.  Again for reasons which are unclear from the evidence before the Court, the Tribunal's reasons were not concluded and delivered until over four months later, on 30 January 2012.  
77The Tribunal determined that there should be no variation to Mr McGuire's care, treatment and detention.
78On 6 December 2011, the Guardianship Tribunal appointed the Public Guardian as the guardian for Mr McGuire to the limited extent of providing advocacy services.
79On 10 October 2012, the Tribunal conducted its eighth review of Mr McGuire.  The Tribunal noted in its reasons, which were published on 5 December 2012, that it was concerned with the question of whether Mr McGuire had spent ""sufficient time in custody"", and the Tribunal noted that by the time of the review, Mr McGuire would have effectively served what would otherwise have been a non-parole period for a sentenced prisoner.  
80At this review, an officer from the CJP indicated that a plan was in place for Mr McGuire, involving support services, appropriate accommodation and up to 70 hours per week support for attending appointments, managing finances, learning daily living skills and other appropriate management skills.
81The Tribunal made its determination in the following terms:
""The Tribunal notes that there may be an application for conditional release made in relation to Mr McGuire in the not too distant future.  In the meantime, the Tribunal notes that until there has been further exploration of any proposed community management plan, and until an independent risk assessment has been carried out, it is appropriate that Mr McGuire continue in his current detention.""
82In November 2012, Dr Christopher Lennings, an expert psychologist, undertook a risk assessment with respect to Mr McGuire.  For this purpose he interviewed him for about one and a half hours.  Dr Lennings assessed Mr McGuire in a number of different ways.  One instrument, the STATIC-99, was administered.  This instrument is regarded as having a high level of predictive accuracy.
83Of this assessment, Dr Lennings said this:
""Mr McGuire achieved a score of 5 on the STATIC-99, based on the sexual offence co-occurring with the violent offence, that the person was unrelated and a stranger to him (known for less than 24 hours), and that he had multiple prior convictions (non-sexual) and also at least one prior conviction that was for a violent matter.  A score of 5 places him in the moderately high risk group, and a person with his score belongs to a group such that over a 15 year period for every 100 people with his score, 40 might be expected to re-offend for a sexual offence, and 52 for a violent offence, post-release.  Mr McGuire's rating on this measure places his risk level above the base rate, indicating a substantial concern regarding his recidivism potential.""
84Dr Lennings also assessed Mr McGuire by reference to a specific approach developed for those with an intellectual disability.  That approach is known as the Assessment of Risk and Manageability of Intellectually Disabled Individuals Who Offend Sexually (ARMIDILO-S).  Dr Lennings was able to identify some principal risk factors by reference to ARMIDILO-S, including poor emotional coping skills, impulsivity, substance abuse, the presence of anti-social traits and a past history of some abuse and neglect.  
85He identified a number of factors protective against offending including the absence of any significant mental illness, the lack of any disciplinary issues in custody and support from his family.  There were other factors upon which Dr Lennings felt he had inadequate information to undertake a rating.  
86Of Mr McGuire, Dr Lennings concluded:
""It appears very little has changed for Mr McGuire in the years since being in jail.  He remains essentially a low functioning man who has little insight into his past behaviour and no concern about it.  Nonetheless, he has been compliant within the correctional system.  That is, within highly structured environments he appears settled.  The question which therefore arises is the likelihood that similar circumstances as to the offence might arise, and any capacity he might have for restraint if those circumstances were to arise.  I believe that should he decide to go drinking again, and is outside of a supervisory regime in the community, similar circumstances might arise.  In regards to the CJP plan, release without suitable consideration of the intensity of supervision and an alcohol management plan could result in further serious harm to members of the public.""
87On 5 December 2012, the Guardianship Tribunal renewed the guardianship order and varied it.  The Public Guardian continued as Mr McGuire's guardian.  The functions of the Guardian were extended so as to include the following:
(a)accommodation: to decide where Mr McGuire may live;
(b)services: to make decisions about services to be provided to Mr McGuire.
88On 27 February 2013, Dr Hearps concluded his report with respect to Mr McGuire.  He had interviewed Mr McGuire on 30 January 2013.  Dr Hearps had access to a good deal of information about Mr McGuire's previous history and psychological and psychiatric condition.  Dr Hearps expressed the view that at that time, Mr McGuire would not meet the criteria for conditional release because he represented a serious danger to the public.  He said this:
""His risk is informed by factors that include history of sexual offending, personality disorder, alcohol misuse, lack of remorse, impulsivity, non-compliance with remediation attempts and exposure to destabilisers in the community.  Independent accommodation with drop-in support would not be adequate to ensure his safe and effective care, given that his access to the community (and potential victims) would be unrestricted.""
89On 5 March 2013, the Tribunal resumed a hearing which it had commenced in December 2012.  This hearing was a particularly lengthy one, apparently occupying most of the morning.  Evidence was taken from Dr O'Dea, a specialist psychiatrist, who had been supervising and treating Mr McGuire during his time in custody, and also from Dr Lennings.  Mr Williams, the relevant program officer from CJP gave evidence and described the proposed program with respect to Mr McGuire should he be released.
90Counsel for the Attorney-General appeared and made submissions, and submissions were put by a solicitor from the Intellectual Disability Rights Service on behalf of Mr McGuire.
91As well, the CJP provided 23 conditions, which it proposed should be imposed in the event that Mr McGuire was released into the community.
92On 10 May 2013, the Tribunal delivered very extensive reasons, 66 pages, which supported its conclusion that Mr McGuire should be released into the community.  It expressed its conclusion in this way:
""The Tribunal notes that there are only seven months remaining on Mr McGuire's limiting term.  The Tribunal is not confident that Mr McGuire will engage in any meaningful way with the programs, limited though they are, that remain available to him whilst he is an inmate in a custodial setting.  He has never shown any inclination or aptitude to do so thus far during his limiting term.  The strong likelihood is that he will refuse to undertake any such programs, and will be released into the community at the end of his term on 31 December 2013.  Hopefully, there will be some assistance given to him by ADHC and the CJP when he is in the community.
There is currently available to Mr McGuire, a CJP SNRG case implementation plan that will offer him 70 hours of support and supervision in the community, in the event that he is granted conditional release.  The Tribunal has the authority to impose stringent conditions upon Mr McGuire in the event that he is conditionally released, although such conditions will only remain in force the balance of his limiting term.  Nevertheless, such a release could be highly structured and, in the event that Mr McGuire breaches any of his conditions, the President of the Tribunal under s 68 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, would be able to order his apprehension, and Mr McGuire could be returned to a correctional centre, if necessary, for the balance of the limiting term.  The conditions that the Tribunal could impose could include the components identified by Dr Lennings and Dr O'Dea that would appropriately address the risks that Mr McGuire presents.
The Tribunal does not consider that further time in custody would further advance any of the purposes of sentencing referred to in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999.  The Tribunal notes that Mr Kell, on behalf of the Attorney-General, does not seek to contend otherwise than that Mr McGuire has spent sufficient time in custody.  Indeed, the Tribunal's view, further incarceration may seriously inhibit an available rehabilitation pathway that is currently being offered to him by CJP.
It is one of the unfortunate features of the NSW Forensic Mental Health system that there are currently very limited transitional programs or 'step down' options available to persons serving limiting terms who suffer from intellectual disability but not from mental illness.  There are no medium secure facilities for such persons, from which they might be permitted to exercise closely monitored and gradually increasing amounts of community leave, in order to test their ability to manage their risks and their own well being in the community prior to release.  The criminal justice program is currently the only available transitional pathway for such persons, which would allow them to be in the community with close support appropriate to their assessment needs.  Having considered the evidence, and having regard to factors referred to in s 74 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, and to the provisions of s 43 of the Act, and having regard also to the principles and form care and treatment set out in s 68 of the Mental Health Act 2007, the Tribunal is satisfied, and finds, that Mr McGuire has served sufficient time in custody, and is also satisfied that, if Mr McGuire were to be released in accordance with the conditions set out below, the safety of Mr McGuire or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by Mr McGuire's release.  The Tribunal is also satisfied that Mr McGuire's release subject to those conditions, would provide him with care of a less restrictive kind that is appropriate and reasonably available to Mr McGuire.""
93The Tribunal indicated that, subject to it being satisfied of certain matters, it was presently minded to make an order granting Mr McGuire conditional release.  The Tribunal determined that on the evidence currently before it:
""... that the grant of conditional release would not seriously endanger Herbert McGuire or any other member of the public ...""
94The conditions to which the Tribunal referred, and which were the subject of its decision were lengthy.  In an attempt to summarise those conditions, it appears that they essentially required the following:
(a)accepting the nominated case manager from the CJP and carrying out all reasonable directions of that case manager;
(b)accepting ongoing treatment from Dr Jeremy O'Dea, specialist psychiatrist, including taking such medication as may be prescribed such as testosterone lowering medication, accepting such psychotherapeutic intervention as may be recommended, and also undertaking psychology sessions for the purpose of addressing Mr McGuire's sexual offending;
(c)living in such accommodation as the CJP provided, accepting supervisory visits to the accommodation and testing for drugs and alcohol as may be appropriately administered;
(d)essentially remaining of good behaviour, abstinent from alcohol, illicit drugs, substances, gambling and other inappropriate activities; and
(e)agreeing to be admitted to a mental health facility for assessment or treatment if so advised by a case manager or psychiatrist.
95On 20 June 2013, the Tribunal ordered the conditional release of Mr McGuire with effect from 26 August 2013.  It set out conditions which accorded with the conditions which it had considered earlier, and which I have summarised above.  In its reasons dated 31 July 2013, the Tribunal expressed itself satisfied that the conditional release of Mr McGuire would not seriously endanger his safety or the safety of any members of the public.  
96It also declared itself satisfied that the conditional release of Mr McGuire would provide him with care of a less restrictive kind than that which he was undergoing in custody, which was appropriate and reasonably available.  
97On 23 August 2013, the conditions for Mr McGuire's relief were varied to a minor extent, essentially to deal with what had been an unforseen interruption to his prescription for, and taking of, anti-libidinal medication.  However, on 23 August 2013, the Tribunal made an order confirming Mr McGuire's release. 
98On 26 August 2013, Mr McGuire was released into the community.  He remains on release.
99On 22 October 2013, the team leader of Clinical Services for the CJP and the clinical consultant jointly prepared a report with respect to Mr McGuire.  The report was sent to the Tribunal.  The report noted that Mr McGuire had been a resident in the identified property of CJP, and he had been the recipient of 70 hours per week of ""direct drop in support"" from New Horizons, the agency delivering the support on behalf of the CJP.  He was listed as a high priority client to receive services from the NSW Department of Housing for suitable and stable permanent accommodation.
100He had been the subject of random drug and alcohol testing.  That testing had indicated total abstinence.  He had commenced attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  He had attended at his treating psychiatrist appointments.  He had consumed the medication prescribed in accordance with the Tribunal's directions.  
101At the time of the review, Mr McGuire was taking anti-libidinal medication to manage his inappropriate sexual behaviour and medication which dealt with his alcoholic cravings.  The report also noted that he had received additional community-based mental health support from Ms Caroline Hare, a psychologist, on a fortnightly basis.
102The report concluded in this way:
""Overall, Mr McGuire has gravitated towards achieving his goals in the community.  That is, he has reconnected with family members (sister, aunt and uncle), demonstrated efforts to acquire permanent housing and maintained compliance conditions to ensure he remains offence free.  To further enhance his re-integration, his key worker will explore his interests and identify options and areas of education, employment, leisure and cultural activities.  Efforts will also be directed to improve his adaptive functioning skills, and decision making.  All community access has been supervised by [New Horizons].""
103On 5 November 2013, the Tribunal conducted a further review.  The case worker from CJP was in attendance and gave the Tribunal an update on Mr McGuire's progress.  One matter which was of concern to the Tribunal was what would happen with Mr McGuire after 31 December 2013, with respect to his accommodation.  Mr Wu, the CJP case worker, reassured the Tribunal that Mr McGuire would be able to stay at his accommodation provided by the CJP: 
""until we really find him an alternative, he is not going to live, like, homeless in the interim, so yeah, he will stay there"".  
Mr Wu also assured the Tribunal that 
""New Horizons service will be available, they'll always continue to be available up until he rejects them, if he - because it's a voluntary service, it's really up to him.  It's always going to be there if he needs it basically.""
104On 10 January 2014, because Mr McGuire continued as a forensic patient, by reason of the interim extension orders made by Judges of this Court, he was reviewed by the Tribunal.  The Tribunal made no further order in relation to the care, treatment and control of Mr McGuire and noted that the present order or orders continued in effect.  In short, the conditional release of Mr McGuire, together with his residence at the CJP and drop-in support, was to be continued.  By the time of this hearing, the number of hours of support per week had been reduced from 70 hours to 35 hours per week.  The Tribunal was satisfied that Mr McGuire remained compliant with the terms of his conditional release, and was dealing with stress very well.  
105It is necessary to record some parts of the Tribunal's determination, as this is the most recent determination prior to the hearing of this present application.  
106The Tribunal recorded this:
""6. Any plans for a change in relation to care, treatment or control of the person:
Mr McGuire's plans depend in part on the outcome of the Attorney-General's application for an extension of Mr McGuire's forensic order.  In his report to the Tribunal dated 5 November 2013, Dr Jeremy O'Dea had indicated that he hoped that Mr McGuire would continue with his psychiatric treatment beyond 31 December 2013.  In circumstances where an extension of Mr McGuire's forensic order has been made, at least on an interim basis, the Tribunal's conditions in relation to continuing to seek treatment from Dr O'Dea would continue.
Mr McGuire explained that his preference is to move out of Blacktown to Penrith or St Marys where he has family.  He has applied for Department of Housing assistance and hopes to find accommodation at a similar rate to the amount he is paying at the moment ($210 a fortnight).  New Horizons has indicated that he will be able to stay in his accommodation until Department of Housing accommodation is available.  Mr McGuire's New Horizons support worker said that he gets on well with all staff and is always grateful for any help.  He is now having only 35 hours a week drop-in assistance, but is still managing well.  Mr McGuire uses the assistance of the New Horizon workers to collect scrap metal for extra cash.""
107The Tribunal noted that the 35 hours per week of drop-in support meant that Mr McGuire was not monitored between 8pm and 8am, and generally had not left his housing unit during that period of time except to visit a local fast food outlet.  
108The Tribunal determined that it would hold its next review within six months, although it did not specify a particular date.
109The most recent report available with respect to Mr McGuire's progress in the community is that prepared by the CJP on 31 January 2014.  
110The report discloses that Mr McGuire informed staff of the CJP that he had consumed alcohol in the holiday season, but that was not detected by the breathalyser test.  It was noted that Mr McGuire was struggling to trust people in the community so as to form relationships, but had continued to socially interact with his family and those known to him.  The report also noted that Mr McGuire was apparently progressing satisfactorily, he was to undertake a random breath test every week, and a urine drug screen test every fortnight, and was to continue to receive 35 hours support per week.  
111The only other matter which requires to be noted in more recent developments is that on a drug test undertaken on 30 January 2014, Mr McGuire was found to have tested positive for cannabis, although on a urine test undertaken on 13 February 2014, the results were negative for cannabis.  
112Ms Martin, Mr McGuire's sister, disclosed in evidence to the Court that Mr McGuire has regularly visited her and her husband at their home since release into the community.  On Christmas Day she shared a glass of wine with Mr McGuire at lunch.  She was unaware that consumption of alcohol was a breach of Mr McGuire's conditions.  She has expressed the view that since Mr McGuire's return to the community, his behaviour has been entirely acceptable.
Expert Assessments
113On 12 December 2013, for the reasons which he then expressed, Davies J ordered that Mr McGuire be examined and assessed by a psychiatrist, Dr Andrew Ellis, and a psychologist, Professor Susan Hayes, and that their reports of that examination and assessment be provided to the Court.  His Honour's reasons are to be found at: Attorney-General of NSW v McGuire [2013] NSWSC 1862.  
114As well as providing reports, both Dr Ellis and Professor Hayes gave evidence before the Court at the final hearing.  
115Dr Ellis set out the results of his examination and his opinion in a report dated 13 January 2014, but filed in Court on 11 February 2014.  
116Dr Ellis concluded that Mr McGuire met the criteria contained within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition (""DSM-5"") for intellectual disability.  Of this diagnosis, he said of Mr McGuire that his level of function showed consistent requirements for assistance in literacy, life skills, problem solving and emotional regulation.  He also identified an alcohol use disorder, but noted that in Mr McGuire's partially controlled environment that the disorder was in remission.  
117He said that Mr McGuire had been assessed at various times as suffering from a personality disorder and that there was sufficient information to conclude that he had adult anti-social personality traits.  
118Importantly, he expressed this conclusion:
""There is insufficient evidence to conclude a paraphilia or psycho-sexual disorder.  There have been no observations in custody, or on release, of pre-occupation with sexual coercion.  It does not report this.  His sex offences occurred on one occasion and of a type associated with intoxication and impulsive opportunity.""
119Dr Ellis concurred with the scoring on the STATIC 99-R instrument which placed Mr McGuire into the moderate-high risk category for sexual re-offence.  Dr Ellis noted the number of ongoing risk facts for future offending by Mr McGuire.  He said this:
""Identified risk factors are poor coping skills arising from his intellectual disability, lack of stable relationships, impulsivity, historical substance abuse, anti-social personality traits, his history of offending, including whilst on conditional liberty, negative attitudes towards his offences and authority, childhood maladjustment, employment problems, poor prior engagement with rehabilitation.  Risk factors specific to sexual offending include targeting a stranger, using physical force during the assault and a history of general offending.  All of these factors may change over time, although some have a more dynamic quality to them.  Most dynamic change in risk relates to effective treatment of underlying conditions and support structures able to be put in place.""
120Interestingly, Dr Ellis noted that the most prominent risk factor for sexual re-offending was deviant sexual arousal which had not been identified in any clinical evaluation or review of Mr McGuire.  He also noted that increasing age, Mr McGuire is now over 40, is associated with less general criminal behaviour and specifically less sexual offending.  
121Dr Ellis noted that Mr McGuire did not have a diagnosis of paraphilia, and raised a question as to the appropriateness of anti-libidinal medication.  
122Dr Ellis noted that Mr McGuire's rehabilitation plan was extensive and individualised, which provided for robust levels of support in decision making, planning, routine activities, accommodation and the moderation of negative effects.  He also noted that the monitoring for alcohol and illicit drug consumption provided effective motivation for abstinence.  
123Of interest is that Dr Ellis noted some difficulties in dealing with intellectually disabled individuals who are forensic patients.  He said this:
""In practical terms, this case highlights structural deficits in service provision for forensic patients.  Although the recall power could be used to direct to a therapeutic environment like a hospital, as Mr McGuire is not a patient of a health service, the only real alternative in case of a breach of conditions is a return to prison.  This would not serve any rehabilitative endeavour, and may in turn increase longer term risk (while containing immediate risks).  Being sent to prison for less than a criminal act would jeopardise his current progress by severing ties with his treatment providers, family and accommodation.  His attitudes to rehabilitative services would likely worsen, feeling unfairly treated.  He would not likely appreciate the nuances of consequence in breaching an order, and concretely assume he was being punished.  It would be exposed to pro-criminal associates.  He would initially be housed in mainstream prison units with no access to programs.  He would likely take some length of time to re-coordinate his care.  There would be limited utility in risk management, and no purpose for rehabilitation with this approach.  
Rehabilitation and community safety are not mutually incompatible goals.  If he were a patient of a health service, the recall power may be used more efficiently in containing an immediate risk in a hospital environment, and better coordination back to service provision in the community.  Being a patient of a health service may give better access to needed health interventions around substance use, and should the need arise, other psycho-tropic medication.  This would give rise to a rehabilitative aspect to the recall power.""
124Dr Ellis concluded in this way:
""Overall, continued forensic status would provide limited improvements in clinical risk management over guardianship with significant potential restriction in terms of recall to prison.  Recall to prison is unlikely to be of benefit, other than in prompting participation in programs.  This type of participation is not of benefit long-term.  This level of restriction would be mitigated somewhat by a collaborative health/disability approach to his management, which would have greater rehabilitative and safety provisions than simply extending the length of his current order.""
125Dr Ellis suggested that any extension order be limited to a period of two years ""... as this is the period after release from prison where re-offending is most likely to occur"".  Dr Ellis also thought that a better assessment of Mr McGuire's participation in programs and re-integration into the community would be able to be judged at that time.
126Professor Hayes gave evidence both by a lengthy and detailed report filed on 14 February 2014, and orally in Court.
127Professor Hayes is a professor of behavioural sciences in medicine at the University of Sydney.  She is an eminently well-qualified and experienced psychologist.  She was also able to engage in a very lengthy assessment with Mr McGuire.  Her consultation with him lasted about one and a half hours.
128Professor Hayes assessed Mr McGuire's intelligence.  She also had regard to the assessment which had been conducted by Dr Susan Pullman in 2008.  At that time, Mr McGuire's full scale IQ was 67, which placed him in the mildly intellectually disabled category.  
129On the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test 2nd Edition, Mr McGuire was assessed as having a functional age equivalent on verbal skills of a 10 year old, and on non-verbal skills of a person who is 10 years and 4 months old.  These scores are similar to an individual in Year 4 of primary school.  
130On the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale 2nd Edition, on communication skills, Mr McGuire had a result indicative of an age equivalent of about 8 years to 8 years and 10 months old; on daily living skills, his age equivalent ranged from 11 years and 6 months to 19 years with a mid-point at about 15 years and 3 months; and on socialisation skills, his equivalent age range was from 8 years and 5 months to 12 years and 9 months, with a mid-point at about 10 years.  
131Professor Hayes summarised this result in this way:
""The results for adaptive behaviour place Mr McGuire in the range of mild intellectual disability at a level lower than 99% of his age peers.  The area of greatest deficit is communication skills where his results are in the range of moderate intellectual disability, consistent with his inability to understand court processes and unfitness to be tried.  
His functional age equivalent scores are all at levels well below his chronological age, especially all areas of communication and interpersonal relationships.""
132Professors Hayes then undertook a risk assessment which included assessing Mr McGuire on static and dynamic factors which have been found to correlate significantly with re-offending by sex offenders with intellectual disabilities.  After reviewing an extensive number of risk factors, Professor Hayes concluded that Mr McGuire presented with dynamic risk factors of low self-esteem, lack of skills of appropriate assertiveness, anti-social attitude, allowances made by staff and possibly some level of staff complacency.
133She also noted the following:
""On the other hand, risk management strategies involving the current conditions under which Mr McGuire is living, indicate some improvements in treatment motivation, establishment of a daily routine, attendance at treatment, response to treatment, acceptance of responsibility for the offences, and motivation to adhere to the conditions.""
134Professor Hayes agreed that on the STATIC-99 risk assessment tool, Mr McGuire was in the category of moderate high risk.  She however noted that the STATIC-99 instrument did not include populations of individuals with intellectual disabilities.  The STATIC-2002 R instrument had a small sample of sex offenders with intellectual disabilities.  On that instrument Mr McGuire was rated as being in the high-risk category.  
135Professor Hayes also assessed Mr McGuire on the ARMADILO-S instrument.  She concluded that Mr McGuire presented an overall convergent risk at the moderate level.  She identified some stable client factors and protective environmental factors which contributed to a decrease in the risk with which Mr McGuire presented.  She also noted risk factors in the future which included future treatment compliance, impulsivity and limited emotional coping skills, previous relationship difficulties, previous substance abuse especially alcohol, and a history of being the victim of physical and child sexual abuse.  
136Professor Hayes concluded with respect to the DSM-5, that Mr McGuire's condition fitted three sets of diagnostic criteria, namely:
(a)intellectual disability;
(b)antisocial personality disorder; and
(c)alcohol use disorder. 
137Professor Hayes was then asked to address the question of whether Mr McGuire posed a risk of causing serious harm to others, which is the test identified in the MHFP Act.  
138She expressed her conclusion in this way:
""Mr McGuire poses a moderate to high risk of causing serious harm to others, according to risk assessment instruments which mainly take into account historic or static factors.  The risk of causing harm to others can be significantly reduced, however, by risk management strategies, some of which have been implemented above, and others which would be recommended.  Some protective factors are present, as described above.""
139Professor Hayes noted that whilst Mr McGuire posed a risk of causing serious harm to others, she was not satisfied that there was any certainty that he would do so, particularly if risk management strategies were implemented.  
140Professor Hayes summarised the risk factors which contributed to Mr McGuire's moderate to high risk of causing serious harm to others and/or re-offending as including, in addition to the matters described above, impulsivity, limited emotional coping skills, previous relationship difficulties and significantly, the lack of offence specific treatment appropriate for a person of intellectual disability and communication deficits (other than medication), apparent lack of appropriate alcohol and other drugs programs and an apparent lack of an appropriate anger treatment program.
141Professor Hayes considered that the likelihood of re-offending would be reduced by Mr McGuire continuing to receive support and supervision, participating in offence specific interventions, including a sex offender program for offenders with intellectual disability; participating in interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy designed to address some of the features of his anti-social personality disorder, particularly aggression and impulsivity, and as well participation in alcohol and other drug programs.  
142She also noted that if Mr McGuire remained abstinent from alcohol and other illicit substances, and continued with his prescribed medication, this would have a significant effect in reducing his risk factors.  
143Professor Hayes expressed the view that there may be less restrictive alternative treatment for Mr McGuire in due course, once he had been able to be assisted by the establishment and maintenance of the various treatment interventions which she had described, and to which I have made reference.  
144Ultimately, Professor Hayes was asked to consider an appropriate period for an extension order.  Of that, she said this:
""If an extension order were to be made, there are two scenarios which need to be considered.  The first would be an extension order for the period of time needed to address the uncertainties in Mr McGuire's current conditions, and to ensure that substance abuse and sex offending programs were available to the client.
The second scenario to be considered would be an extension order for the period of time that Mr McGuire would engage in this programs: as indicated by the research, a period of at least 12 months and preferably 24 months, in a treatment program yields the best outcomes for sex offenders with intellectual disabilities.  If Mr McGuire consented to participation and complied with the program requirements, an extension order may not be required for that duration, but it would be important to ascertain that he was willing to continue to engage in treatment.""
145In a supplementary report, filed on 3 March 2014, Professor Hayes identified a possible program which could be provided to Mr McGuire which was offence specific and took account of his intellectual disabilities.  That would be a sex offender program modelled on a program developed by Professor William Lindsay from the University of Abertay in Scotland.  
146In their evidence before the Court, both experts largely adhered to their written opinions and gave some explanations of them.
147Dr Ellis was asked about the likely period of time it would take for Mr McGuire to have a significant reduction in the level of risk which he presently poses.  He gave this answer:
""I think if you had detailed information about what rehabilitative endeavours were going to be undertaken, you could have a better estimate than you do currently.  I have made an estimate based on the, I mean, I think one thing is, in terms of rehabilitation with people with intellectual disabilities, it generally takes longer.  That any kind of counselling intervention that is delivered needs to be of a longer duration with more repetition and perhaps shorter, shorter sessions themselves but extend it over time.  Generally, the programs that have been done are of the order of two years.  The ones, ... that are shorter than that, tend to be less effective.""
148Professor Hayes also gave evidence on the subject of the length of time for which it would be appropriate for an extension order.  She said this:
""A: Let's not beat around the bush here, this man has committed a sex offence and therefore he needs a targeted program.  You can't just expect him to give up sex offending because he gives up alcohol.  So you need a specific and targeted program, and also his other offences in the past, and to some extent the sex offence, appear to involve aggressive behaviour and so therefore you need anger management.  So the uncertainty that he hasn't got those programs in place and how are they going to be put in place. ... 
Q: How long does an anger management program typically last.  
A: Well, typically it lasts for a brief period of time, two or three months.  Professor Lindsay's work in Abertay has demonstrated that quite clearly people with intellectual disabilities require at least 12 months, and for maximum benefit 24 months, in a program, and those are people that he has been seeing who have been on parole in the local area and their parole has often been set at that period of time so that they can benefit from the program.""
149Professor Hayes also said that with the programs to which she was referring, it would be likely that an assessment could be made of progress in a period between three and six months after the commencement of the program.
Discernment150In keeping with the authorities and principles to which I have earlier referred, it is necessary to consider the issues which arise.  
151The first issue which needs to be considered, is whether I am satisfied to the requisite degree, as required by cl 2 of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act, that Mr McGuire poses ""... [a] risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient"".
152The second issue is whether Mr McGuire poses an ""unacceptable risk"".  As I have earlier explained, what is involved is a balancing exercise between Mr McGuire conducting himself in a way which may cause serious harm to others, and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for Mr McGuire of being subject to the supervision, including the imposition of significant conditions, by the Tribunal on the other hand.  
153It is necessary to bear in mind that in considering this question, before coming to a conclusion that Mr McGuire does pose such an unacceptable risk, I have to be satisfied to a high degree of probability.  The phrase ""high degree of probability"" is, on the authorities, a higher standard of proof than the civil standard, but less than the criminal standard.  
154As well, I need to bear in mind that cl 2(2) of Sch 1 of the MHFP Act notes that in considering whether there is an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm, the Court is not required to determine that it is more likely than not that Mr McGuire will cause serious harm before concluding that there is an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others.
155The third issue, assuming the first two are established, is whether on the evidence, there is another less restrictive means available for dealing with the risk posed, than making an extension order, and continuing Mr McGuire's status as a forensic patient.  
156The fourth issue which arises only if I am satisfied that there is no other less restrictive means for managing the risk of Mr McGuire, is the appropriate period for which an extension order ought be made?
157The evidence discloses that the principal underlying issue with respect to the existence of a risk of causing serious harm to others is that Mr McGuire is a mildly intellectually disabled individual who presents with a significant number of risk factors which require lengthy one-on-one treatment to minimise the risk of such harming behaviour in the future.  The need for this treatment is combined with the need for him to stay abstinent from alcohol and to avoid illicit drug usage, because the effects of alcohol and illicit drugs is to reduce any inhibition, and thereby increase, his tendency towards impulsive conduct, including sexual offending and violence.  
158The prominent feature of Mr McGuire's behaviour whilst in custody, and whilst in the community subject to the supervision of the Tribunal, is that with one or two exceptions, which I regard as not significant and merely idiosyncratically aberrant, Mr McGuire has survived without causing any serious harm to others in an environment which is structured, and in which he has been given significant assistance and support.  The other feature which is apparent from his history whilst in custody is that, with the exception of nine sessions of psychotherapy with Ms Caroline Hare, Mr McGuire has not had any suitable treatment provided to him which addressed the specific features of his conduct, other than the prescription of specific medication and the requirement, supported by random testing, that he refrain from alcohol and illicit drugs.
159Accordingly, the evidence reveals that although Mr McGuire has not whilst being in custody or in the community under the supervision of the Tribunal, caused anyone serious harm, or indeed any harm, his behaviour is rationally explained by the structured environment, and extensive supervision and support which he has received.
160The inadequacy of the availability of suitable treatment programs whilst he has been in custody, particularly coupled with his intellectual disability, has meant that the risk factors and in particular Mr McGuire's impulsivity, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and what can appear at times to be oppositional behaviour, remain unmitigated because of the absence of effective, targeted treatment programs.  Some progress has been made since release into the community, but there is little confidence amongst the experts that sufficient progress has been made such as would justify a conclusion that there is little, or no, risk of Mr McGuire causing serious harm to others if he is not a forensic patient.  
161I accept the evidence of both Dr Ellis and Professor Hayes that, assessed against various statistical instruments, Mr McGuire is at moderate to high risk of causing serious harm to others.  There was no evidence to the contrary.  I accept further that such risks, whilst untreated and unmitigated, will continue.  Accordingly, I am satisfied to a high degree of probability about the first issue, namely, Mr McGuire presents a risk of causing serious harm to others.  That risk is a moderate to high one.  
162I turn then to consider the second and more difficult issue of whether that risk is an unacceptable one.  
163In opposing the extension order being made, senior counsel for Mr McGuire submits that any remaining risk is not an unacceptable one, when balanced with the consequences to a forensic patient such as Mr McGuire, who has an intellectual disability rather than a mental illness, which are particularly onerous, principally because a breach of a condition may result in a revocation of the conditional release order by the Tribunal, which would lead to Mr McGuire's detention in a prison rather than a mental health facility.  Senior counsel for Mr McGuire points to the clear, and unequivocal, opinion of Dr Ellis that detention in a correctional centre is contrary to Mr McGuire's best interests, antithetical to his rehabilitation and would be a harsh punishment in circumstances where Mr McGuire had not committed any offence.  
164Senior counsel for Mr McGuire points to the fact that having regard to what Mr Wu told the Tribunal, and to the contents of the exhibit which outlines the detail of the CJP, Mr McGuire continues to qualify for assistance under the CJP and there is no reason to believe that he would not continue to accept such support and assistance from the program as is presently in existence. 
165The Attorney-General in submissions in response identifies these features as pointing to a finding that the risk is an unacceptable one: the fact that Mr McGuire has not had any of his risk factors mitigated; the seriousness of his past offending; if an extension order is not made, the absence of any compulsion with respect to prescription medication, abstinence from alcohol and abstinence from illicit drugs, and his acknowledged lack of independent living skills.  The Attorney-General submits that these factors suggest that there is a very real prospect that Mr McGuire would offend again in a way which caused serious harm to others.  The Attorney-General accepts that whilst supervision by the Tribunal does have an adverse effect on the liberty of an individual, having regard to what has occurred in the past with the Tribunal's supervision, the Court ought accept that such restriction on Mr McGuire's liberty as is involved in an extension order, is not an undue restriction for him and when compared with the protection of the community, does not mean that there is other than an unacceptable risk.  
166I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that on all of the evidence, that Mr McGuire poses an unacceptable risk of causing serious harm to others if he ceases being a forensic patient.  
167As I have said, I accept the categorisation of Mr McGuire referred to by Professor Hayes and Dr Ellis, that he is in a moderate to high-risk category when assessed by reference to the various statistical instruments.  They concluded that Mr McGuire posed a moderate to high risk of causing serious to harm to others.  I accept this assessment, which was not actually challenged by senior counsel for Mr McGuire.  I also accept their evidence that Mr McGuire's risk factors for engaging in conduct of a kind which would cause serious harm, have, in large part, not been mitigated by any appropriate treatment.  I also accept that abstinence from alcohol and illicit drug usage, together with the consumption of anti-libidinal and other prescription medication is necessary in order to reduce the moderate to high risk of causing serious harm to others, in particular by engaging in impulsive conduct including sexual re-offending.  
168Untreated, and un-medicated, the risk which Mr McGuire poses to the community of causing serious harm is entirely unacceptable.
169Of course, before reaching a conclusion in accordance with the legislation, I have to have regard to, in a balancing exercise, what will happen to Mr McGuire if an extension order is made, and the extent of any negative impact on Mr McGuire of being subject to the supervision of the Tribunal.  
170Unlike other cases under similar legislation, the Court in this case is not confronted with a proffered set of conditions to which an offender may be required to be subject.  The only balancing consideration is that insofar as Mr McGuire continues to be a forensic patient, he will be subject to reviews at approximately six month intervals by the Tribunal, and the imposition of such conditions as the Tribunal thinks appropriate.  If Mr McGuire does not comply with those conditions, the President of the Tribunal may revoke his conditional liberty and confine him to custody.  The Tribunal may also alter or amend any of the conditions which it has imposed, including by increasing the supervision to which Mr McGuire may be subject, or by placing significant restrictions on his freedom to engage in the community, including where he can live and work, with whom he can associate and by whom, and to what extent he is to be supervised.  .  
171However, the Tribunal has not yet determined what conditions may be appropriate for Mr McGuire for the entirety of any period that he would continue as a forensic patient.  All that the Court presently knows is the nature of the conditions to which Mr McGuire is presently subject, which continue whilst he is the subject of an interim order.  The Court is entitled to expect that a Tribunal will conduct a review of the conditions in light of any extension order which may be made.
172The Court also knows that the Tribunal is a specialist body constituted under s 140 of the Mental Health Act and having the functions conferred on it by statute.  The Tribunal consists of lawyers, psychiatrists and a group of lay members nominated by various interest groups.  In the hearings involving Mr McGuire, the Tribunal has been presided over by a senior and very experienced lawyer.  More recently, the current President of the Tribunal, Mr Dan Howard SC has presided and there has been a senior psychiatrist as a member of the panel, as well as the community member.
173My observation based on the evidence in this case, of the Tribunal's interactions with Mr McGuire, which I have carefully read, is that the Tribunal has gone about its work in a highly professional, thorough and sensitive manner.  It has paid careful attention to Mr McGuire's progress whilst in custody and has been particularly conscious of the need to maintain the least restrictive environment in which he can be treated and maintained.  Although there has been one apparent breach of conditions brought to the Tribunal's attention, that was not dealt with by way of confining Mr McGuire to custody, rather it was dealt with by of an adjustment of conditions so as to enable him to proceed to live in the community.
174Of course, if there is a serious breach of any of Mr McGuire's conditions it is open to the Tribunal to have him confined in custody.  However, the point to be noted is that confinement to custody does not appear to be the automatic response by the Tribunal in the event of any breach of any condition.
175The Court has no reason to think that the Tribunal would engage, when conducting any of the reviews required if Mr McGuire was to remain a forensic patient, in conduct which was in any way inappropriate or not designed to reflect the principle that the community needs to be protected and, as well, that Mr McGuire needs to be rehabilitated; and that such treatment as Mr McGuire is required to undertake is done in a way which involves the least restrictive means available, and that any restrictions on his liberty are not inappropriately imposed or continued.
176Although I accept that making an extension order involves a continuing detriment to Mr McGuire and his right to be at liberty, having regard to the risk which exists of his causing serious harm to others, I am not satisfied that such supervision and conditions as may be imposed by the Tribunal are unduly onerous.  This means that in the conduct of the balancing exercise, I am persuaded to a high degree of probability that I should find that there is an unacceptable risk of Mr McGuire causing serious harm to others if he does not remain as a forensic patient.
177The next issue is whether I am satisfied to the requisite degree that the unacceptable risk cannot be adequately managed by less restrictive means.  
178Senior counsel for Mr McGuire submits that Mr McGuire's risk of causing serious harm to others can be adequately managed by the existing guardianship order together with Mr McGuire's continued participation in the CJP, including accepting the support provided by the New Horizons service, and undertaking and completing such treatment interventions as are provided.
179Necessarily, if Mr McGuire was not a forensic patient, there would be no enforceable obligation on him to take the presently prescribed medication, or to agree to be abstinent from alcohol or illicit drugs, or subject himself to testing to ascertain the state of his abstinence from alcohol or illicit drugs.  As well, whilst he may be provided with treatment, there would be no compulsion upon him to undertake that treatment. 
180I am not satisfied that such less restrictive means would be an adequate way of managing the risk which Mr McGuire poses.  In short, to mitigate the unacceptable risk, it is essential that Mr McGuire be the subject of ongoing treatment programs and that he be completely abstinent from alcohol and illicit drugs.  
181That simply cannot be secured by the alternative proposed, namely, of having a guardian appointed and his voluntary participation in the CJP, whilst Mr McGuire's character traits remain as they are.  
182Importantly, neither of the experts expressed any confidence that Mr McGuire would, in the absence of compulsion, undertake his treatments or continue to regularly take his medication.
183On this issue, I did not have the benefit of any evidence at all from Mr McGuire.  I do not draw any inference adverse to Mr McGuire because he did not give evidence.  However, the absence of such evidence means that I do not have any direct statement of his intention to voluntarily comply with the suggested treatment and other features of the CJP.
184On the whole of the evidence and, in particular, having regard to Mr McGuire's intellectual disability, I cannot be satisfied that Mr McGuire would voluntarily attend at, and participate in, any treatment provided.  Nor am I satisfied that without the supervision provided by the CJP, and overseen by the Tribunal, and without the possibility of changed conditions which would reward him for compliance and improvement or conversely by punishing him, help him to understand the importance of engaging with the CJP, Mr McGuire's risk of causing serious harm to others would be an acceptable one.
185It follows that I am appropriately satisfied that there is no less restrictive means to address the risk of Mr McGuire causing serious harm to others, other than for the Court to make an extension order.  
186The fourth issue is to identify and fix the appropriate period for the extension order.  Senior counsel for Mr McGuire submits that as a matter of principle, the order should not be made for any longer than the minimum time necessary to enable the risk to be mitigated.  I accept this as the appropriate principled approach in this case.
187The Attorney-General submits that a period of two and a half years is the appropriate period for an extension order.  That figure is arrived at by relying upon the outer period of two years nominated by Professor Hayes as being a period within which any treatment programs may be completed, and then adding to it a period of six months which the Attorney-General argues is not an unreasonable period to enable the Tribunal to identify the relevant treatment programs, identify a person who can provide the relevant treatment programs, and to commence those programs.  
188On the other hand, senior counsel for Mr McGuire submits a period of six months would be all that is necessary, because by that stage it is likely that an appropriate treatment program would be identified and then the Court would be in a position to know with some greater certainty, what the length of an extension order ought be.
189Because this is a case in which there is no identified program for treatment which Mr McGuire is presently undertaking, there is necessarily some uncertainty about the appropriate length of the order.  Much also depends upon how Mr McGuire manages any intervention, and manages his life in the community.  Clearly, he is doing so quite well at the moment because the intensity of supervision has been reduced by one half. 
190It seems to me that the length of time must be sufficient to enable firstly, the identification of a suitable program and a suitable provider, and for that program (or programs) to have been commenced and to have been in existence for a sufficient period of time to enable a reasonable assessment to be made.
191I accept the opinion of Professor Hayes that progress ought be able to be assessed in such programs between three to six months.  
192The next scheduled review by the Tribunal of Mr McGuire is in July.  However, if an extension order is made, I would expect the Tribunal to schedule a review promptly, upon the making of the order, so that the nature of treatment and a possible provider could be attempted to be identified and the program commenced as soon as possible.
193Hopefully, a program may be able to be started by August or September and Mr McGuire's progress assessed six months after that.
194As well, a period to about then would provide a reasonable time to observe whether Mr McGuire has the capacity to abstain from alcohol and to be compliant with prescription medication.  Such a period would also cover the bulk of the period identified by Dr Ellis as being the time within which people released from custody are likely to re-offend.  
195Accordingly, I have concluded that the appropriate time for an extension order is 12 months.
196It should be understood that I regard this as the minimum time necessary to enable Mr McGuire to commence and progress along the path of reducing his unacceptable risk.  I do not, by concluding that this is the appropriate time for a supervision order, express any view as to whether by the end of the period Mr McGuire or will not require a further extension order.  That will be a matter that needs to be assessed at that point in time.
Order
197I make the following order:
(1)Order pursuant to cl 1 of Schedule 1 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 that the status of Mr Herbert McGuire as a forensic patient be extended up to and including 21 March 2015.

2763529,Miller v R [2014] NSWCCA 34,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: This judgment relates to appeals against conviction and sentence following the conviction of the Appellant, Damon Charles Miller, at separate District Court trials in 2007 and 2009 for offences of dishonesty. 

The Trials and Sentences

2Following a trial before GHT Armitage ADCJ and a jury between 4 and 28 June 2007 ('the 2007 trial""), the Appellant was convicted of obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s.178BA Crimes Act 1900, and of four counts of using a false instrument contrary to s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900. 
 
3On 14 September 2007, Armitage ADCJ imposed the following sentences:

(a) for the s.178BA offence, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 19 June 2008 and expiring on 18 June 2010, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 19 June 2010 and expiring on 18 June 2012;

(b) on each of the s.300(2) counts, imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of two years commencing on 20 June 2007 and expiring on 19 June 2009 with a balance of term of two years commencing on 20 June 2009 and expiring on 19 June 2011.

4Between 27 July 2009 and 21 August 2009, the Appellant stood trial before Knox DCJ, by way of a Judge alone trial (""the 2009 trial""), upon an indictment containing two counts of obtain benefit by deception contrary to s.178BA Crimes Act 1900, three counts of obtain benefit by false statement contrary to s.178BB Crimes Act 1900 and one count of use false instrument contrary to s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900.

5On 21 August 2009, Knox DCJ found the Appellant not guilty of one count under s.178BA and guilty of the remaining counts: R v Miller [2009] NSWDC 331. 

6On 11 December 2009, Knox DCJ imposed the following sentences:

(a) On each of Counts 2, 4, 5 and 6 (the offences under s.178BB and s.300(2)) - a fixed term of imprisonment (described in the sentencing order as a term of non-parole imprisonment) for three years commencing on 11 December 2009 and expiring on 10 December 2012. 

(b) On Count 3 (a s.178BA offence) - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of three years commencing on 11 June 2010 and expiring on 10 June 2013, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 11 June 2013 and expiring on 10 December 2014.

Procedural History of the Appeals

7The present appeals have had a protracted history in this Court. The appeal arising from the 2007 trial was listed for hearing in 2009, and was vacated on the application of the Appellant.

8Following the lodging of an appeal from the 2009 trial, the Appellant's appeals were mentioned before the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal on many occasions. Both appeals were listed for hearing before this Court on 6 March 2012, but the hearing was vacated on the application of the Appellant.

9On 2 August 2012, the appeals were called over before the Registrar who was informed that Mr McGovern SC, instructed by Mr Klees, solicitor, would be representing the Appellant in both appeals. 

10On 30 August 2012, the appeals were again called over before the Registrar, and a joint application was made that the appeals be fixed for hearing on 1 March 2013 with a one-day estimate, with liberty being granted to the parties to relist the matters for mention. That grant of liberty was not activated.

11When the appeals were called on for hearing on 1 March 2013, Mr McGovern SC announced his appearance for the Appellant, and informed the Court that the appeal with respect to the 2009 trial was ready to proceed, but that an adjournment application would be made concerning the appeal from the 2007 trial. The Court had not been placed on notice that any adjournment application was to be made. The Crown opposed the further adjournment of the appeal.

12The adjournment application was said to relate to difficulties in the provision of instructions from the Appellant to his legal representatives. In light of the history of the proceedings, the Crown's opposition and the fact that the Court had read the documentary material for the purpose of the appeal, the adjournment application was refused. 

13The hearing of the appeals proceeded. The appeal from the 2009 trial was heard first. Thereafter, the Court having confirmed the refusal of the adjournment application, the hearing of the appeal from the 2007 trial proceeded with the Appellant appearing for himself. At the request of the Court, Mr McGovern SC and Mr Klees remained in Court whilst that appeal was heard.

14The delay in the appeals being heard, attributable to the Appellant, meant that the hearing in this Court took place within three months of the expiry of the Appellant's non-parole period. As will be seen, the variety of grounds advanced by the Appellant, arising from two trials, each with evidence and issues of some complexity, meant that an early determination of the appeals was not a realistic prospect.

Appeal from the 2009 Trial

15It is appropriate to consider first the appeal from the 2009 trial.

16The Appellant stood trial before Knox DCJ upon six counts, which were in the following terms:

(a)Count 1 (s.178BA Crimes Act 1900) - Between 16 February 2003 and 29 February 2004 at Bardwell Park, he did dishonestly obtain for himself a valuable thing, namely a cheque in the amount of $39,633.17 by a deception, namely that he was at the time acting on behalf of Giovanni Capparelli pursuant to a Power of Attorney.

(b)Count 2 (s.178BB Crimes Act 1900) - Between 16 February 2003 and 19 February 2003 at Bardwell Park, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing namely a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, he did publish a statement, namely that Miller and Associates are solicitors, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular.

(c)Count 3 (s.178BA Crimes Act 1900) - Between 9 June 2003 and 22 July 2003 at Sydney, he did dishonestly obtain for himself a financial advantage, namely deposits made by Tolhurst Noall Limited into a bank account in the name of Damon Charles Miller by a deception, namely that he was authorised to realise the value of shares belonging to Giovanni Capparelli. 

(d)Count 4 (s.178BB Crimes Act 1900) - Between 31 July 2003 and 5 August 2003 at Bardwell Park, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing namely a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, he did publish a statement, namely that Miller and Associates are solicitors, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular.

(e)Count 5 (s.178BB Crimes Act 1900) - Between 4 December 2003 and 9 December 2003 at Bardwell Park, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing namely a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, he did publish a statement, namely that David Miller is a solicitor, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular.

(f) Count 6 (s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900) - Between 31 March 2004 and 30 April 2004 at Sydney, he did use a false instrument, namely a cheque in the amount of $39,633.17 knowing it to be a false instrument, with intention of inducing another person, namely Raymond Gall, to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to do an act to the prejudice of another, namely Giovanni Capparelli.

17The Appellant was acquitted on Count 1 and convicted on each of Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. 

An Overview of the 2009 Trial

18This Court has the benefit of the trial Judge's reasons for returning the verdicts arrived at following the 2009 trial, which assist the appellate process in this Court: R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 at 9 [26]. It is appropriate to set out parts of the trial Judge's judgment on conviction before turning to the Appellant's grounds of appeal.

19Knox DCJ commenced the judgment in the following way: R v Miller at [1]-[7]:

""1 The Crown case is based on the following matters, many of which are disputed by the accused:

2 In August 2002, Giovanni Capparelli, then aged 62 years, was introduced to the accused, Damon Charles Miller. Mr Capparelli's wife had died in February of that year. Mr Capparelli said he was then in need of the services of a solicitor. He had issues involving the Department of Community Services (DOCS) with the residence and custody of his two children then aged 15 and 14 years. They were, at that time, living with their maternal aunt and uncle. There were also immigration issues relating to those relatives. Mr Capparelli was distressed about all of those matters. He was still mourning the loss of his wife.

3 Mr Capparelli was aware that he had a superannuation entitlement arising out of his late wife's employment. He also had some shares in various public companies (Woodside, Caltex, Normandy and Newmont Mining).

4 Mr Capparelli and Mr Miller met on a number of occasions. Mr Miller had Mr Capparelli sign a widely drafted Power of Attorney. Mr Capparelli said he did not know what the document was and said that Mr Miller did not advise him what it was.

5 Thereafter, Mr Capparelli gave Mr Miller some documents and Mr Miller, on behalf of Mr Capparelli, contacted DOCS and various institutions including the HIP Superannuation Fund and the share registries. Letters were sent to the institutions on the letterhead entitled 'Miller and Associates, Solicitors, Conveyancers and Agents'. Mr Miller was not, and never had been, a solicitor. Attached to those letters were the Power of Attorney and other completion documents signed by Mr Capparelli. Those letters and documents requested, and purported to authorise, the encashment and distribution of the superannuation entitlement and the sale of the shares.

6 The Crown alleges that a cheque for $39,633.17 (for the late Mrs Capparelli's superannuation entitlements) was sent to Mr Miller. Mr Capparelli said he did not receive any of those monies. Mr Miller said he gave him that money in cash over a period. 

7 Mr Capparelli's shares were sold following documents being sent to the various share registries and broking firms. Mr Capparelli said he did not receive any of those proceeds totalling $13,358.20.""

20The trial Judge expanded upon the Crown and defence cases as follows (at [17]-[23]):

""Crown case: particular counts

17 The Crown case was that in August 2002 and subsequently, the accused held himself out to be a solicitor (count 2: February 2003) and that he was the proprietor of, or associated with a firm of solicitors, namely Miller and Associates (count 4: July/August 2003).

18 The accused gave Mr Capparrelli some documents to sign and Mr Capparelli did so, he said, without reading them or knowing what the documents were. One of these documents was a Power of Attorney (count 1: February 2003 - February 2004). 

19 On 10 June 2003, the accused used the Power of Attorney to arrange the sale of shares owned by Mr Capparelli and for the proceeds of these sales to be paid into a Bank of Cyprus account. That account had been opened by the accused. The account was subsequently closed down. Mr Capparelli did not authorise these sales and did not receive the proceeds of the sales of the shares.

20 Shortly afterwards, Mr Capparelli gave the accused documents pertaining to his late wife's superannuation fund. There is no issue but that Mr Capparelli was entitled to receive that benefit. The accused suggested that Mr Capparelli keep some of the money ($10,000) to make himself comfortable. Mr Miller rang the relevant officer at the Public Trustee's office in Mr Capparelli's presence stating that he was Mr Capparelli's solicitor. Another document was an application for payment of the superannuation benefit (exhibit T6). Accompanying that document was a letter from the accused attaching the Power of Attorney (exhibit T4). The superannuation fund sent Miller and Associates a cheque for $39,633.17. That cheque was cashed by the accused and had been endorsed on its back with a false signature (count 3: June/July 2003). Mr Capparelli said he never received that money from the superannuation fund, nor did he authorise the payment of it to the accused. 

21 Police inquiries revealed that in correspondence from the accused to the superannuation company on 17 February 2003, the accused requested that all monies be paid directly to himself on behalf of Mr Capparrelli and not into the late Mrs Capparelli's estate. The letter was on letterhead entitled 'Miller & Associates Solicitors', which was a false statement (count 5: December 2003). This letterhead was also used for correspondence with the superannuation company on 1 August, 4 August, and 8 December 2003. 
Specific Crown allegations

22 The Crown case was that the statements by the accused that he was a solicitor were false and misleading, known by him to be false and misleading, and done for the purposes of obtaining a benefit for himself, namely, obtaining for himself, Mr Capparelli's entitlements from the superannuation fund, as well as the distribution to Mr Miller of the proceeds of the sale of Mr Capparelli's shares. Further, that the use by Mr Miller of the Power of Attorney was invalid, that the deed was not a proper Power of Attorney, that it was not witnessed and that it was utilised for purposes which were not authorised. The deed containing the Power of Attorney was never explained to Mr Capparelli by Mr Miller.

Defence case 

23 The defence case is that the accused never represented that he was a solicitor. Mr Miller had prepared a carefully drafted Power of Attorney for Mr Capparelli to sign (which he did) and advised him as to the scope and extent of the power. Mr Miller said that Mr Capparelli wanted to sell his shares and for the proceeds to be put in an account in Mr Miller's name to avoid Mr Capparelli losing his Centrelink benefits and subsidised housing entitlements. Mr Miller denied receiving the proceeds of the sale of the shares for, or on behalf of, Mr Capparelli and said that, although he had received the superannuation refund for Mr Capparelli, that he had paid that money in cash to Mr Capparelli. The defence case is also that at all times the accused was acting under a Power of Attorney in relation to the totality of the counts and each count. Further that the Power of Attorney was signed by Mr Capparelli and witnessed.""


21Knox DCJ made findings with respect to the principal Crown witness, Mr Capparelli, and the Appellant, who gave evidence at trial. His Honour said (at [57]-[62]):

""Observations: Mr Capparelli

57 Mr Giovanni Capparelli gave evidence confirming the relevant matters relating to him as set out in the Crown case. Mr Capparelli needed to obtain the assistance of the interpreter/translator to read documents. On many occasions he had difficulty following the wording of documents. I did not regard the majority of his evidence or presentation as either exaggerated nor feigned. What was also clear was that Mr Capparelli has a detestation of the accused. He used a number of opportunities to make critical comments towards Mr Miller - often regardless of the question asked. I have therefore viewed his evidence with caution particularly where it was not corroborated or supported.

58 I do regard Mr Capparelli as being a witness of the truth. The exceptions to this finding relates to his evidence as to what he thought Mr Miller was to do for him and in what capacity in relation to obtaining his entitlements to his late wife's superannuation refund and whether his signature to the deed was witnessed. While I do not think that he was aware of precisely what he signed, I find that he did intend that Mr Miller was to act for him and represent him to the HIP Superannuation Fund and the document was an authorisation for that purpose and for him to ultimately receive his late wife's superannuation contributions. I was also not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his evidence that the document was not witnessed.

59 Mr Capparelli's memory - though at times hazy - did not appear to be defective in any material respect although, for example, he could not remember when he stopped work and went onto a sickness benefit. There were some inconsistencies between his evidence at the trial and what he had told the police in 2004. I do not regard those as being of material importance in the circumstances of this case.

60 The events and the deprivation of his shares and entitlements had clearly continued to distress and anger Mr Capparelli. That distress and anger was obviously there at the time he made his statements to the police in 2004. There was some conflict between his recollection and details set out in his statement (in 2004) to the police.

Observations: Mr Miller

61 I have already indicated in the reasons given in dismissing the stay application my observations of Mr Miller that he is an intelligent, articulate and quick-thinking individual. However, in the main areas of dispute, his accounts were not supported by independent evidence and was totally contrary in many areas to that of independent, and unconnected, witnesses whose evidence I accepted. 

Findings: Mr Miller

62 I also found Mr Miller to be unreliable and most unimpressive in many aspects of his evidence, in particular, his account of what he and Mr Capparelli said to each other about the sale of the shares, his denials about the existence, preparation and use of the statutory declarations, his denials about not giving the proceeds of sale of the shares to Mr Capparelli, his negotiation of the superannuation refund cheque to Mr Gall and what had prompted him to take that action for the cashing of the cheque in that way.""

22The trial Judge made some significant findings concerning Mr Capparelli at [63]-[64]:

""63 It must have been perfectly obvious to Mr Miller that Mr Capparelli was a person under a series of disabilities, both innate and arising out of the then emotional situation he was in. Mr Capparelli was born in 1940 and is now almost 69 years old. He came to Australia in 1971 unable to speak or write English. He is a slightly built and softly spoken man - though ultimately voluble when pressed on matters concerning his children and the loss of his monies. He gave evidence slowly in a mix of broken English and Italian through an interpreter. He had worked as a labourer with the NSW Railways Workshop and had little formal high school education - at least in English. He said he had never had anything to do with lawyers before. He did not manifest any of the sophistication which would have been required to stage what would have been a relatively elaborate scheme to receive monies and then allege he had not as seems to be implicit in Mr Miller's case.

64 He married his wife in 1986 and had two children born in 1987 and 1988. His wife died of cancer in February 2002. He was facing an investigation and the possible loss of his children to relatives of his late wife who were causing him major difficulties. Mr Miller was aware that that was precisely why he turned to Mr Miller.""

23His Honour proceeded to make detailed findings observing that, where there was a conflict, he preferred the evidence of Mr Capparelli to that of the Appellant. In particular, the trial Judge found that Mr Capparelli believed, on the basis of the Appellant's representations, that the Appellant was a solicitor: R v Miller at [65].

24The trial Judge (at [93]) found that the Appellant represented himself as a solicitor orally, and had utilised documents and letterhead which reinforced this impression:

""Both Mr Capparelli and Mr Bourke said that Mr Miller described himself to Mr Capparelli, and to others on the phone in Mr Capparelli's presence, as a solicitor. The letters on a letterhead containing the accused's surname as well as addresses and telephone numbers connected with him, and the firm's use of his surname and that the firm name included the words 'Solicitors, Conveyancers and Agents'. I accept and find that there was no such firm of solicitors nor a solicitor called Damon or David Miller. Virtually all the details on the letterhead had a geographical, personal or friendship connection with Mr Miller and aspects of his life in Campsie and Bardwell Park. Further, Mr Miller's self-description as a solicitor (on the accounts of at least Mr Capparelli and Mr Bourke which I accept) is in conflict with the letterheads of the letters tendered. The typing and content of those letters have also been careful not to include the names of any person - either under the final signature or other than as referred to as 'the writer'.""

25The trial Judge made further findings adverse to the Appellant at [101]-[102]:

""101 Mr Miller was not, and never had been, a solicitor. He knew he was not a solicitor. It was a dishonest and deceitful statement. He knew that was an important representation, not only to Mr Capparelli but also the other institutions involved. Mr Miller not only knew it was false, he knew that both Mr Capparelli and Mr Bourke were misled and that the institutions to which he made the representations would be mislead. Completing the statutory declaration and the associated share sale forms in the way that he did was the only way Mr Miller was able to get the monies paid to himself.

102 The totality of the circumstances relied on by the Crown establish the finding that the representations were made by the accused both orally and in terms of the letters and statutory declarations made. Further, that the only available inference is that those representations were made dishonestly and deceitfully and that he knew that they were dishonest and deceitful as well as being false and misleading. The context of the various aspects of dishonesty and falsity included the deceit of the HIP super fund and the institutions involved in getting the benefit of Mr Capparelli's entitlement as well as the sale of Mr Capparelli's shares.""

26His Honour found (at [103]) that the monies obtained were retained and used by the Appellant:

""I do not accept Mr Miller's evidence that he made cash payments to Mr Capparelli. I am satisfied that Mr Capparelli did not receive any money from, or in satisfaction of, his entitlement to his late wife's superannuation nor from the sale of the shares owned by him. Further, that all those monies were paid to, or ultimately received by, Mr Miller - in the case of the monies received from Mr Gall's company, by instalments. The proceeds of the sale of the shares went into Mr Miller's personal account. There was an estate account opened at that time. There was no reason why that cheque could not have been paid into that account - rather than Mr Gall's account - and an urgent clearance requested. I do not accept that there were the reasons for urgency advanced - particularly given the time periods which had elapsed. Mr Miller said that he waited for the cheques to clear and then paid them to Mr Capparelli in cash. There were no correlating cash withdrawals shown on the bank statements consistent with his evidence - other than for an amount of about $1000.""

27The trial Judge made the following express findings concerning Count 6 (at [104]-[106]):

""104 The Crown relies on the fact that the cheque paid to Mr Gall was fraudulently endorsed with the signature of Mr Capparelli. The Crown relies on the fact that Mr Miller must have known it was fraudulently endorsed. 

105 It is clear that the cheque contained a signature that was not Mr Capparelli's - although it is in a form (with the surname preceding the given name) that indicated a substantial familiarity with the person who signed that name with Mr Capparelli's actual signature. Mr Miller's evidence is that when he handed the cheque over, it did not contain that signature. Mr Gall's evidence is that it did - although not the words 'please pay' etc.

106 I accept and find that the signature was not Mr Capparelli's and that Mr Miller knew that it was not Mr Capparelli's signature. Further, that the accused knew that he needed to have a cheque containing such a signature on it to persuade Mr Gall to cash it and make the payments to him, Mr Miller, rather than to Mr Capparelli.""

28His Honour made the following findings concerning the elements of deception and dishonesty (at [81]-[87]):

""Deception

81 One of the main issues in this case is whether the act of the accused in obtaining and using a Power of Attorney was an act of deception. Clearly Mr Capparelli signed the document. His evidence was that he did not understand what the document was or the effect of it, nor was it explained to him, nor did he ask for any explanation of it. I accept that evidence.

82 Mr Miller's account was that it was a carefully drafted document containing the additional paragraphs as set out in the exhibit (exhibit T4).

83 Deception is defined under section 178BA(2) as including a 'deception as to the present intention of the person using the deception ...'. It is also clear that there must be what has been described as 'sufficient connection' and the obtaining of the material benefit. In my view, that is the case here.

84 I find that Mr Capparelli had no intention of providing Mr Miller with a document authorising Mr Miller to utilise the refunds of the superannuation and the share proceeds to his (Mr Miller's) own benefit, and not to the benefit of Mr Capparelli or his family members including his children. 

85 I find that Mr Miller was not entitled to either of those amounts other than as the donee of a Power of Attorney for Mr Capparelli. Further that Mr Capparelli never intended nor authorised those amounts to be paid to Mr Miller or for his benefit - R v Hamilton (1991) 92 Cr App R 54; R v Simmonds (VIC CCA, 29/10/92, unreported).


Dishonesty

86 The Crown needs to establish that the statements were dishonest and that the accused knew the statements were dishonest. 

87 An act of the accused is regarded as dishonest if it is such according to the ordinary notions of the tribunal of fact, according to the standards of ordinary, decent people - Peters v R (1991) 92 CLR 493. Included in that assessment is the issue of whether the accused believed he had a legal right to the property obtained - R v Love (1989) 18 NSWLR 608. Here there is no evidence that the accused had an entitlement to receive and retain the funds for his own use and purposes. The only basis that he was entitled to receive the money, if at all, was pursuant to the Power of Attorney, and then for Mr Capparelli's benefit or at his direction.""

29After a number of other findings, the trial Judge moved to conclusions and verdicts with respect to each of the six counts (at [107]-[121]):

""107 I accept and find that the offences occurred in the time periods and between the dates referred to in each of the counts on the indictment on the basis of the oral evidence and the documents tendered.

Count 1 (section 178 BA)

Between 16 February 2003 and 29 February 2004 at Bardwell Park in the State of New South Wales, did dishonestly obtain for himself a valuable thing, namely a cheque in the amount of $39,633.17 by a deception, namely that he, Damon Charles Miller, was at the time acting on behalf of Giovanni Capparelli pursuant to a power of attorney.

108 The issue is whether the accused dishonestly obtained for himself the superannuation cheque by a deception, namely, that he was acting pursuant to a Power of Attorney on behalf of Mr Capparelli. Clearly Mr Miller was acting pursuant to a Power of Attorney that bore the signature of Mr Capparelli.

109 Mr Capparelli wanted Mr Miller to act for him to obtain the superannuation entitlement. He signed a document knowing that it was a formal document, which Mr Miller needed to obtain that refund. Mr Capparelli may not have known precisely what that document was nor what its powers were but there is, in my view, no doubt that he was aware that he was signing a formal document authorising Mr Miller to act on his behalf.

110 I do not think that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Connerly did not witness the Power of Attorney. Clearly a signature of a Mr Colm Connerly was on that deed. Also it is clear that Mr Capparelli knew of the person called 'Colin' and that he had an Irish accent. If Mr Connerly remained outside in the car - as he did according to Mr Capparelli's evidence - it is difficult to see how Mr Capparelli would have known either his name (even as 'Colin') or the details of his accent. He clearly met him at stage, although it is not clear precisely when. I do not think the Crown has established that Mr Connerly did not witness the deed. Accordingly, I do not think that the Crown has established that the Power of Attorney was not a valid document or that there was a deception in that regard. 

111 The accused is acquitted of this count. 

Count 2 (s 178BB)

Between 16 February 2003 and 19 February 2003 at Bardwell Park in the State of New South Wales, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing, namely, a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, did publish a statement, namely that Miller and Associates are solicitors, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular. 

112 I find that the accused during those dates, with the intent to obtain the superannuation entitlement cheque for himself, made or published a statement, namely, letters on the letterhead containing the words 'Miller and Associates, Solicitors, Conveyancers and Agents' knowing the statements that Miller and Associates were solicitors was false or misleading in a way which he knew was going to be material and important to those to whom the letters and contents were forwarded, namely, the HIP Superannuation Fund administrators. 

113 In my view, all the elements of this offence have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is found guilty of this count.

Count 3 (s 178BA)

Between 9 June 2003 and 19 July 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did dishonestly obtain for himself a financial advantage, namely deposits made by Tolhurst Noall Limited into a bank account in the name of Damon Charles Miller by a deception, namely that Damon Charles Miller was authorised to realise the value of shares belonging to Giovanni Capparelli. 

114 I find that the accused dishonestly obtained for himself the deposits made into his account by a deception, namely, that he was entitled to realise the value of the shares of Giovanni Capparelli.

115 In my view, all the elements of this offence have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is found guilty of this count.

Count 4 (s 178BB)

Between 31 July 2003 and 5 August 2003 at Bardwell Park in the State of New South Wales, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing namely a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, did publish a statement, namely that Miller and Associates are solicitors, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular.

116 I find that the accused during the dates specified with the intent to obtain the superannuation entitlement cheque for himself made or published a statement, namely letters on the letterhead of Miller and Associates knowing the statements that Miller and Associates were solicitors was false or misleading in a way which was going to be material and important to those to whom the letters and contents were forwarded, namely the HIP Superannuation Fund administrators.

117 In my view, all the elements of this offence have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is found guilty of this count.

Count 5 (s 178BB)

Between 4 December 2003 and 9 December 2003 at Bardwell Park in the State of New South Wales, with intent to obtain for himself a valuable thing namely a cheque from HIP Superannuation Fund, did publish a statement, namely that David Miller is a solicitor, which statement he then knew to be false and misleading in a material particular.

118 I find that the accused during the dates specified with the intent to obtain the superannuation refund cheque for himself made or published a statement, namely, the statutory declaration, knowing the statements that David Miller was a solicitor was false or misleading in a way which was going to be material and important to those to whom the letters and contents were forwarded, namely, the HIP Superannuation Fund administrators.

119 In my view, all the elements of this offence have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is found guilty of this count.

Count 6 (s 300(2))

Between 31 March 2004 and 30 April 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, namely a cheque in the amount of $39,633.17 knowing it to be a false instrument, with intention of inducing another person, namely Raymond Gall, to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to do an act to the prejudice of another, namely Giovanni Capparelli. 

120 I find that on the dates specified that the accused used the cheque for $39,633.17 endorsed with the false signature of Giovanni Capparelli which Mr Miller knew was a false signature to induce Raymond Gall to accept the cheque as genuine, to enable the cheque to be cashed into Mr Gall's company account of Hencot Pty Ltd. and thereby to enable the proceeds of payment of that cheque to be paid to the accused's account and not to Giovanni Capparelli.

121 In my view, all the elements of this offence have been established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is found guilty of this count.""

Grounds of Appeal Against Conviction at 2009 Trial

30In Amended Grounds filed on 28 February 2013, the Appellant relied upon six grounds of appeal with respect to conviction, some with multiple components. The pleaded grounds state:

(a) Ground 1 - On the finding of Knox DCJ that the Appellant was authorised pursuant to a Power of Attorney to act on behalf of Mr Capparelli, his Honour should have concluded that Count 3 of the indictment had not been established beyond reasonable doubt, in that it had not been established beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was not authorised to realise the value of the shares belonging to Mr Capparelli.

(b)Ground 2 - In relation to Counts 2, 4 and 5 in the indictment, Knox DCJ should have held that there was no offence created of ""makes or publishes ... any statement which he knows to be false and misleading in any material particular"". Alternatively, Counts 2, 4 and 5 offended the rule against duplicity and the Appellant's convictions on each count should be quashed.

(c) Ground 3 - Further or alternatively to Ground 2, Knox DCJ erred in convicting the Appellant on Counts 2, 4 and 5 because he omitted to identify and make findings about the relevant elements of the charges alleged in the indictment and, in particular, because s.178BB(1) Crimes Act 1900 did not make it an offence for a person to make or publish a statement which is false and misleading in a material particular, so that the verdicts of Knox DCJ on Counts 2, 4 and 5 were unsafe and unsatisfactory.

(d) Ground 4 - Knox DCJ erred in convicting the Appellant on Count 6 in the indictment, because the charge did not disclose an offence punishable by law, or alternatively failed to identify essential factual ingredients of the alleged offence.

(e)Ground 5 - Knox DCJ erred in convicting the Appellant on Count 6 in the indictment, because an essential element of the charge as alleged was not established in that the cheque was endorsed ""please pay Galloping Press"" by a person or persons unknown.

(f)Ground 6 - Further, or in the alternative, to Grounds 1-5 above, the Appellant's convictions on Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the indictment should be quashed and a new trial ordered, on the basis of new evidence which has become available since the trial, and where there is a significant possibility that Knox DCJ would have arrived at a different result had that evidence been available for use at the trial.
 
Some General Comments Concerning Appeals Under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912

31It is useful at this point to make some observations concerning the functions of this Court considering an appeal against conviction following a trial on indictment. These comments apply generally to appeals from conviction by a jury (such as the 2007 trial) or conviction by a Judge sitting alone (such as the 2009 trial). 

32This Court is a court of error operating within the confines of ss.5-6 Criminal Appeal Act 1912: R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174; 112 A Crim R 201 at 202 [3]-[5]. Put shortly, s.6(1) provides for an appeal against conviction upon the ground:

(a) that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence;

(b) that there was a wrong decision on any question of law;

(c) on the basis of any other ground, there was a miscarriage of justice.

33Even where error is otherwise demonstrated, it is open to the Court to apply the proviso in s.6(1) and to dismiss an appeal against conviction if the Court concludes there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.

34In Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250, the High Court observed at 256 [12], in the context of a conviction appeal from a trial on indictment by Judge alone, that use of the potentially confusing phrase ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" to cover the several elements in s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is liable to mislead, and that there was no substitute for giving attention to the precise terms of s.6(1) itself. This statement will be kept in mind in addressing grounds of the Appellant which use the ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" formula.

35The Appellant's grounds of appeal concerning the 2009 trial contend that the trial Judge erred, in varying respects, so that one or more of the verdicts of guilty should be set aside by this Court. 

36No ground of appeal arising from the 2009 trial contends that any verdict was unreasonable. Rather, Grounds 1-5 assert specific errors which are largely claims of legal error. Ground 6 is a fresh or new evidence ground.

37To the extent that consideration of any ground involves an examination of the facts, it is appropriate to keep in mind the strong credibility findings made by the trial Judge which were adverse to the Appellant: Fleming v The Queen at 266-267 [44]-[46]; Keir v R [2007] NSWCCA 149 at [20].

38In addition, several grounds (particularly arising from the 2007 trial) require leave under Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules. With respect to those grounds, it is for the Appellant to demonstrate that the ground is arguable and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted so that leave should be granted to rely upon the ground: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 319 [72]; R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 at 352-353 [20]-[24].

Ground 1 - Claim of Inconsistent Verdicts in Acquitting the Appellant on Count 1 and Convicting Him on Count 3

39The terms of Ground 1 appear at [30](a) above. 

The Appellant's Submissions

40Mr McGovern SC contended that the verdicts of acquittal on Count 1 and conviction on Count 3 were inconsistent so that the conviction on Count 3 should be quashed, applying the principles in Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348. 

41It was submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove, in Count 3, a causal connection between the deception used and the financial advantage obtained for the purpose of s.178BA Crimes Act 1900. The question here, it was submitted, was whether the deception relied upon, that the Appellant was authorised to realise the value of shares belonging to Mr Capparelli, was an operative cause of the obtaining of a financial advantage, namely deposits made by Tolhurst Noall Limited into a bank account in the name of the Appellant. Mr McGovern SC submitted that the focus is upon the question whether or not the Appellant was authorised.

42Senior counsel noted, with respect to Count 1, his Honour's finding that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the Power of Attorney was not a valid document or that there was a deception in that regard: R v Miller at [110] (at [29] above).

43The case against the Appellant in relation to Count 3 concerned the Appellant making a request of Mr Peter Morgan, of Tolhurst Noall Stockbrokers, to sell Mr Capparelli's shares in Woodside Petroleum, Caltex Australia Limited and Newmont. 

44The Appellant submitted that there was no evidence that Mr Capparelli had signed the Power of Attorney whilst reasonably mistaken about the nature or extent of the obligations created by it: Petelin v Cullen [1975] HCA 24; 132 CLR 355. It was noted that, during the course of the trial, the trial Judge had commented that this was not a non est factum case (AB828).

45Mr McGovern SC submitted that the Power of Attorney constituted a general authority to take steps on behalf of Mr Capparelli, which extended to the sale of Mr Capparelli's shares.

46Reliance was placed upon ss.159, 161 and 163B Conveyancing Act 1919, which applied to these events, with the Powers of Attorney Act 2003 having no application.

47It was submitted that s.163B Conveyancing Act 1919 supported the Appellant's submission that the Power of Attorney extended to the sale of Mr Capparelli's shares. Section 163B Conveyancing Act 1919, in 2003, provided as follows:

""163B Power conferred by prescribed form of instrument

(1) Subject to this section, an instrument (whether or not under seal) in or to the effect of the form in Schedule 7 confers on the attorney thereby appointed authority to do on behalf of the person executing the instrument anything the person executing the instrument may lawfully authorise an attorney to do.

(2) The authority conferred by an instrument referred to in subsection (1) does not include:

(a) authority to exercise or perform any power, authority, duty or function as a trustee conferred or imposed on the person executing the instrument, or

(b) unless it is expressly conferred by the instrument - authority to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, as a result of which a benefit would be conferred on the attorney appointed by the instrument.

(3) Where an instrument referred to in subsection (1) specifies any conditions or limitations to which the authority conferred by the instrument is to be subject, the authority is so conferred subject to compliance with those conditions or limitations.""

48Mr McGovern SC submitted that the Appellant was entitled to rely upon the Power of Attorney as against Mr Capparelli and any other person. He was authorised to deal with the shares. The Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the Power of Attorney did not authorise the Appellant to realise the value of the shares.

49Viewed in this way, the Appellant submitted that the trial Judge's findings with respect to Count 1 rendered it inevitable that the Appellant be acquitted on Count 3, so that the conviction on Count 3 was inconsistent and should not stand.

Crown Submissions

50The Crown pointed to the textual differences between Counts 1 and 3. Further, it was submitted that the trial Judge's findings with respect to Counts 1 and 3, by reference to the contents of each charge, serve to explain the different verdicts reached by the trial Judge. 

51The Crown noted the trial Judge's finding that despite Mr Capparelli's desire to have the Appellant act for him in relation to the claim for his wife's superannuation, that desire ""did not extend to wanting his shares sold by Mr Miller. His denial of that was both colourful and emphatic"": R v Miller at [92].

52The Crown submitted that the trial Judge had directed himself specifically as to the requirement that there be a causal connection between the deception and the obtaining of the financial advantage. Count 1 was directed to the Appellant dishonestly obtaining for himself a valuable thing, a cheque in the amount of $39,633.17. Count 3, on the other hand, was directed to the Appellant dishonestly obtaining for himself a financial advantage, namely deposits made by Tolhurst Noall Limited into a bank account of the Appellant.

53The Crown submitted that there was no inconsistency in the trial Judge's findings in respect of the Power of Attorney for several reasons. Firstly, the trial Judge had accepted the evidence of Mr Capparelli that he did not fully understand what he was signing and that it was not explained to him, with the Appellant's evidence on this issue being rejected. Secondly, an examination of the Power of Attorney in question (Exhibit T22) did not support the Appellant's contention. The Crown submitted that, properly construed, the Power of Attorney did not authorise the Appellant to sell shares held in the name of Mr Capparelli. 

54Thirdly, it was submitted that Count 3 did not rely on the presentation of the Power of Attorney alone. The deception was stated specifically to be that the Appellant ""was authorised to realise the value of shares belonging to Giovanni Capparelli"". The Crown submitted that, on no view of the evidence, was the Appellant so authorised, and that is what his Honour found.

55The Crown submitted there was no inconsistency in the verdicts with respect to Counts 1 and 3.

Decision

56The Appellant bears the burden of establishing inconsistency of verdicts, and it is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside: Mackenzie v The Queen at 368; Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [58]. 

57A ground of appeal asserting inconsistent verdicts is encountered more frequently with respect to verdicts of a jury. Of course, where this ground is relied upon arising from a Judge-alone trial, this Court has the benefit of the reasons of the trial Judge, to be considered in conjunction with the evidence adduced at the trial. It is necessary to read fairly the entirety of the trial Judge's reasons which may bear upon the question of suggested inconsistency between verdicts.

58In Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167 at [36]-[38], the following was said concerning s.178BA Crimes Act 1900:

""36 On a prosecution for an alleged offence under s.178BA Crimes Act 1900, it is not necessary for the Crown to establish that it was the person deceived who suffered the relevant loss: R v Ho; R v Szeto at 147. 

37 What must be established, however, is a causal connection between the deception used and the financial advantage obtained. The deception must have been the means whereby the financial advantage was obtained, or the effective cause of the financial advantage being obtained. It is an essential ingredient of an offence under s.178BA that the cause of the giving of the financial advantage was the deception used by the accused person: R v Stanhope (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 September 1987, pages 6-8); R v Clarkson [1987] VR 962 at 980; R v Ho; R v Szeto at 147. 

38 The question whether the deception was an operative cause of the obtaining of financial advantage, falls to be answered as a question of fact by the members of the jury applying their commonsense: R v King [1987] 1 QB 547 at 553."" 

59To address this ground of appeal, it is appropriate to refer to the Power of Attorney dated 20 January 2003 (Exhibit T22). Clauses 1 and 2 of the Power of Attorney (parts of the standard form) provided that Mr Capparelli appointed the Appellant:

""1. ... to be my attorney(s) (where more than one jointly and/or severally) to exercise, subject to any conditions and limitations specified in Part 2 of this Instrument, the authority conferred on him/her/them by Section 163B of the Conveyancing Act, 1919, to do on my behalf anything I may lawfully authorise an attorney to do. 

2. In the exercise of the authority conferred on him/her/them by Section 163B of the Conveyancing Act, 1919, my attorney(s) is/are authorised to execute an assurance or other document, or do any other act, whereby a benefit is conferred on him/her/them.""

60The conditions and limitations contained in Part 2 of the Power of Attorney were as follows:

""1. This power of attorney authorises the Donee to carry out all matters relating to the estate of my late wife, Merma Capparelli and arising out of that estate including the opening of bank accounts related to the estate and the depositing and withdrawl [sic] of funds and their distribution.

2. This power of attorney also authorises the Donee to carry out all matters relating to funds due to myself and to collect and deposit those funds and to make withdrawls [sic] from accounts conducted in his name or in the name of the estate the opening of which I authorise.""

61A further important piece of evidence with respect to Count 3 was the Appellant's letter to Mr Morgan at Tolhurst Noall Sharebrokers dated 11 June 2003 (Exhibit T3; AB 287). In that handwritten letter, the Appellant confirmed that he acted for Mr Capparelli pursuant to the relevant Power of Attorney, listed a series of Mr Capparelli's share holdings and requested Mr Morgan to ""realise funds associated with the sale of Mr Capparelli's shares and deposit those funds into my account"", being a nominated account in the Appellant's name with the Bank of Cyprus.

62It is necessary to read paragraphs 1 and 2 of the conditions and limitations together. Those conditions and limitations qualify and restrict the earlier general power contained in paragraphs 1 and 2, which refer expressly to s.163B Conveyancing Act 1919. Paragraph 1 of the conditions and limitations referred expressly to the estate of Mr Capparelli's wife. There was no mention of a power to sell Mr Capparelli's shares anywhere in the document.

63At this point, an important finding of the trial Judge must be noted. It was the evidence of Mr Capparelli, accepted by the trial Judge, that the authority granted to the Appellant extended to aspects concerning the estate of his late wife. As the Appellant well knew, it was never intended by Mr Capparelli that the Appellant be authorised to sell Mr Capparelli's own shares, let alone deposit the proceeds of sale of those shares into the Appellant's own bank account. 

64The second paragraph of the conditions and limitations should be construed as relating back to the subject matter of the first paragraph, namely matters relating to the estate of Mr Capparelli's late wife. Upon this approach, the Power of Attorney did not constitute authority for the Appellant to sell Mr Capparelli's shares. 

65Further, it was the Appellant's handwritten letter to Mr Morgan (Exhibit T3) which included express false statements that he was authorised to realise the specified shares and deposit the resulting funds into his own account. On the trial Judge's findings, the Appellant well knew that he was not so authorised. This document played an important role in the determination of Count 3. Unlike Count 1, which referred to the Power of Attorney only, Count 3 alleged a dishonest obtaining by the Appellant by a deception which went beyond the Power of Attorney.

66It was open to the trial Judge to be satisfied that the Appellant dishonestly obtained for himself a financial advantage, being deposits made by Tolhurst Noall Limited into the Appellant's own bank account, by a deception, namely that he was authorised to realise the value of shares belonging to Mr Capparelli.

67I do not consider that the Appellant's submissions under this ground are assisted by anything said in Petelin v Cullen. Indeed, the finding of the trial Judge was that Mr Capparelli signed the Power of Attorney understanding that the Appellant may use it to obtain the superannuation payment, but with no knowledge that the Power of Attorney may be used by the Appellant to do anything at all with respect to Mr Capparelli's shares. As the trial Judge observed (see [51] above), Mr Capparelli denied that he wished the Appellant to do anything at all with his shares, a denial that was ""both colourful and emphatic"".

68Nor is the Appellant assisted by statements concerning the scope of authority in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52; 219 CLR 165, to which reference was made in the course of oral submissions. It is necessary to keep in mind the trial Judge's findings concerning the significant vulnerabilities of Mr Capparelli (at [22] above), as well as the finding that the Appellant acted dishonestly to exploit Mr Capparelli by acting (in the manner alleged in Count 3) in a way that was entirely contrary to the wishes of Mr Capparelli.

69To the extent that submissions on behalf of the Appellant under this ground seek to rely upon aspects of the Appellant's own evidence, it is necessary to keep in mind that the trial Judge comprehensively rejected the Appellant as a credible and reliable witness. This Court, as a court of error, should take into account the advantage of the trial Judge in seeing and hearing the Appellant give evidence in considering what use can be made of his evidence on appeal to this Court. 

70In my view, there is no inconsistency between the verdicts on Count 1 and Count 3, let alone an inconsistency rising to the point that intervention of this Court is necessary to prevent a possible injustice. Having regard to the offences alleged in Counts 1 and 3, and the evidence which related to them, it was open to the trial Judge to reach the verdict returned on Count 3.

71I would reject the first ground of appeal.

Grounds 2 and 3 - Claimed Defects in the s.178BB Counts and Errors in the Determination of Counts 2, 4 and 5

72Grounds 2 and 3 were argued together and it is appropriate that the grounds be considered together in this judgment.

73Ground 2 focuses upon the offences under s.178BB charged in Counts 2, 4 and 5, which appear at [16](b), (d) and (e) above. The first leg of Ground 2 asserts that these counts allege an offence not known to the law. The second limb of Ground 2 contends, in the alternative, that Counts 2, 4 and 5 were bad for duplicity. 

74Section 178BB(1) (now repealed) was in the following terms:

""178BB Obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements

(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

...""

The Appellant's Submissions

75It was submitted for the Appellant that each of the s.178BB counts contained four elements, namely:

(a) the publishing of the statement by the Appellant;

(b) which was false in a material particular;

(c) which the Appellant knew to be false in a material particular; and

(d) which was made by the Appellant with intent to obtain, for himself, a financial advantage.

76By Ground 2, the Appellant contends that each of Counts 2, 4 and 5 did not charge an offence known to the law as the formula ""false and misleading in a material particular"" was used, instead of the words of s.178BB(1), being ""false or misleading"".

77In support of the second limb of Ground 2, the Appellant submitted that, by use of the term ""false and misleading"", Counts 2, 4 and 5 described two separate offences rolled into the one count, contrary to the rule against duplicity. Reliance was placed upon Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77; 59 CLR 467 at 497-498; S v The Queen [1989] HCA 66; 168 CLR 266 at 280-281 and Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; 188 CLR 77 at 104-112.

78In support of Ground 3, the Appellant points to the trial Judge's finding concerning Counts 2, 4 and 5 that the Appellant ""made or published a statement"": R v Miller at [112], [116], [118] (at [29] above). It was noted that each of Counts 2, 4 and 5 alleged that the Appellant did publish a statement, with no reference to the statutory alternative of making a statement.

79It was submitted for the Appellant that the trial Judge, in this way, had not used the words contained in the indictment and, in so doing, had omitted to identify precisely the elements of the charges and to identify precisely the requirements that needed to be established to convict the Appellant, and the factual matters upon which he relied to prove that each charge was made out. Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in R v Rinaldi; R v Kessey (1993) 30 NSWLR 605.

80It was submitted that there is a lack of necessary findings in the reasons and that the ultimate findings did not establish the offences as charged. 

81It was submitted further, with respect to Count 2, that the Appellant could not have been convicted on this charge unless the trial Judge had taken into account the Power of Attorney as a relevant factor in assessing the Appellant's intention. 

82With respect to Count 4, it was submitted that there was nothing in the text of the relevant ""Miller and Associates"" letter that supported any claim by the Appellant to the cheque that was subsequently paid over, with the letter relating solely to the claim or entitlement of Mr Capparelli.

83With respect to Count 5, it was submitted that there must be established to the criminal standard, a nexus between the statement and the obtaining of the cheque. It was submitted that the trial Judge could not have reached ""a safe and satisfactory conclusion"" on the issue without construing the statement in its textual context, and without weighing up and taking into account the Power of Attorney.

Crown Submissions

84In answer to the Appellant's submission based upon the inclusion in Counts 2, 4 and 5 of the words ""false and misleading"" rather than the statutory alternatives, the Crown submitted that the element may be proved by either feature or by both. By using both terms, it was submitted that the Crown had taken on a heavier burden than was necessary in establishing one or the other only. It was submitted that no miscarriage of justice had been demonstrated by the Appellant nor any unfairness in the conduct of the trial.

85With respect to the Appellant's duplicity argument in the second limb of Ground 2, the Crown submitted that the cases relied upon by the Appellant all concerned circumstances where there was more than one act relied upon in support of the charge. The Crown submitted that that was not so in the present case. In each of Counts 2, 4 and 5, there was only one statement, or act of publication, relied upon for each count. There were three separate representations, charged separately. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that no issue of duplicity arises.

86With respect to the complaint in Ground 3 that the trial Judge had used the words ""made or published"" in his findings, the Crown submitted that this was simply a slip in circumstances where the indictment alleged in each case that the Appellant did ""publish a statement"".

87The Crown pointed to documentary evidence which supported a publication by the Appellant in the manner alleged in each of Counts 2, 4 and 5. 

88The Crown submitted that any defect in the indictment had been cured by the verdicts, relying upon Doja v R [2009] NSWCCA 303; 198 A Crim R 349.

89If the Court found error under Grounds 2 or 3, the Crown submitted that the proviso ought be applied and that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred.

Decision

90At the outset, it is appropriate to observe that no point was taken during the trial concerning the presence of the words ""false and misleading"" in Counts 2, 4 and 5, in the manner now complained of in Ground 2. It may be taken that the Appellant and his counsel understood the case which he was called upon to meet with respect to each of the s.178BB counts. 

91The deficiencies in these counts do not, in my view, give rise to a finding that the offences charged are not known to the law. These were imperfect formulations of known offences. Applying the reasoning in Doja v R and Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232 at [66]ff, the charges alleged offences known to the law. The defects were, in any event, cured by the verdicts: Doja v R at 366-372 [107]-[130], 382 [181]. As the Crown has observed, the formulation in the counts involved the Crown having to establish additional components, of which the trial Judge was satisfied, findings which were open to his Honour in the circumstances of the case.

92I accept the Crown submission that duplicity is not demonstrated in the circumstances of this case. A single set of events was alleged in each count, not giving rise to any uncertainty as to the charges brought against the Appellant. The Appellant's argument concerns what are, in effect, drafting errors in the formulation of the charges contained in Counts 2, 4 and 5.

93The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the charges did not allege offences known to the law. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred or that any other basis exists for this Court to intervene.

94With respect to Ground 3, to the extent that his Honour utilised words in parts of his finding which did not correspond with the terms of the charges (""made or published"" instead of ""published""), I accept the Crown submission that these may be appropriately characterised as slips. A fair reading of the entirety of his Honour's judgment supports this conclusion.

95Further, Counts 2 and 4 each alleged that the Appellant published a statement ""that Miller and Associates are solicitors"". Count 5 alleged that the Appellant published a statement ""that David Miller is a solicitor"". There was very substantial evidence that the Appellant had acted in these ways. 

96With respect to Count 2, the Crown relied upon a letter dated 17 February 2003 on the letterhead ""Miller and Associates, Solicitors, Conveyancers and Agents"" (Exhibit T14, AB270). Other evidence in the trial established that the address on the letterhead was connected to the Appellant, being premises of his wife's clothing or dry cleaning business, and that the landline number on the letterhead was also connected to that business. The claim form which accompanied that letter was also in evidence (Exhibit T6, AB246-249). Other evidence in the trial established that there was no firm of solicitors by that name practising at that time at Bardwell Park. As previously mentioned, the trial Judge made a finding adverse to the Appellant that he had represented himself as a solicitor. The combination of documentary and oral evidence constituted a very strong Crown case on this issue. 

97With respect to Count 4, a letter dated 1 August 2003 (on the same letterhead as in Count 2) was in evidence (Exhibit T15, AB273-274). As well as the features of the letterhead that linked the document to the Appellant referred to above, the contents of this letter operated adversely to the Appellant, serving to identify him as ""the writer"" by reference to, amongst other things, evidence in the trial of the Appellant's knowledge of the personal family matters referred to in the letter. Once again, there was a very strong Crown case with respect to this count. 

98With respect to Count 5, the Crown relied upon a further letter on the same letterhead dated 8 December 2003 (Exhibit T16, AB276). That letter referred to enclosures, being two statutory declarations of Mr Capparelli and a further statutory declaration of the writer of the letter. A statutory declaration said to have been made by ""David Miller, solicitor"" on 5 December 2003 was in evidence (Exhibit T8, AB253-254). There was other evidence in the trial that the Appellant used the name David Miller. In his evidence, the Appellant admitted to using that name on other occasions, but he denied that he had used it on Exhibit T8. He claimed to have no knowledge of the creation of the statutory declarations, including Exhibit T8. The trial Judge rejected the evidence of the Appellant in this regard, a finding that was clearly open to his Honour.

99At all times, the Appellant knew the nature of the allegation and the case he had to meet with respect to Counts 2, 4 and 5. Each of these counts alleges that the Appellant published the statement with intent to obtain ""for himself"" a valuable thing, namely the superannuation cheque. The trial Judge had to be satisfied that the Appellant intended to obtain the cheque for himself, and not for Mr Capparelli. There was abundant evidence to support this conclusion.

100I accept that the published statement alleged in each of the charges did not involve the Power of Attorney. Each count identified specifically the representation as being that ""Miller and Associates"" (Counts 2 and 4) and ""David Miller"" (Count 5) were solicitors. There was abundant evidence that these statements were false and misleading, and that the Appellant well knew them to be so.

101The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that Counts 2, 4 and 5 do not disclose offences known to the law. Further, no unfairness or other miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated with respect to these counts. 

102To the extent that Grounds 3 and 5 contends that the verdicts of guilty on Counts 2, 4 and 5 were ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"", I am satisfied that it was open to the trial Judge, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant on these counts and I would reach the same conclusion.

103I reject Grounds 2 and 3. 

Grounds 4 and 5 - Challenges to Conviction on Count 6 - Using a False Instrument Contrary to s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900

104These grounds were addressed together in submissions and will be considered together in this judgment.

The Appellant's Submissions

105Mr McGovern SC submitted that the essence of the charge in Count 6 under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900 involved the making of a false document. It was submitted initially that the allegation relates to the cheque itself, not to any endorsement on the back of the cheque or any signature. The Appellant submitted that the cheque was drawn by HIP Superannuation on a particular account in the amount of $39,633.17. It was submitted that it was not a false instrument in that it was in the form in which it was made. 

106Mr McGovern submitted that Count 6 also involved establishing an intention to induce Raymond Gall to accept the cheque in the amount of $39,633.17 as genuine and, because of that acceptance, to do an act to that person's prejudice. It was submitted that the required elements included Raymond Gall accepting the instrument as genuine and doing an act to his own prejudice. 

107The Appellant submitted, however, that the trial Judge departed from the terms of the charge and focused upon acceptance by Mr Gall that the instrument was genuine and, because of that acceptance ""to do an act to the prejudice of another, namely Giovanni Capparelli"": R v Miller at [8]. Reference was made to the ultimate finding on Count 6: R v Miller at [120] (at [29] above). 

108Mr McGovern SC submitted that there was no satisfactory evidence from Mr Gall as to who wrote on the cheque ""Please pay Galloping Press"".

109The Appellant placed particular emphasis upon the evidence of Mr Gall, submitting that he had conceded that the words ""Please pay"" were not on the back of the cheque when the Appellant brought it in. Mr Gall stated that the words ""Please pay"" had been placed there by someone else in his organisation or by the Appellant (AB992). 

110In these circumstances, Mr McGovern SC submitted that the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the endorsement was written by the Appellant and that the trial Judge should have so found.

Crown Submissions

111The Crown submitted that Count 6 involved a charge of using a false instrument under s.300(2), and not making a false instrument under s.300(1). It was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the Appellant had made the false instrument or endorsed it. It was only necessary for the Crown to prove that the Appellant knew that the endorsement was false. 

112The Crown submitted that the complaints of the Appellant concerning Count 6 were misconceived.

113With respect to the prejudice issue, the Crown submitted that the submission for the Appellant was misconceived. The indictment averred that the intention of the Appellant (which is what had to be proved) was to induce Mr Gall to accept the instrument as genuine and, because of that acceptance, to do an act to the prejudice of another, namely Mr Capparelli. 

114The Crown submitted that the trial Judge considered the terms of Count 6 as charged and found the offence proved as his Honour was entitled to do.

Decision

115Count 6 is set out at [16](f).

116It has not been demonstrated that there is any defect in the terms of Count 6, which pleads an offence under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900 using the language of the section. 

117The offence was one of using a false instrument under s.300(2). The Appellant's submissions by reference to the making of a false instrument under s.300(1) do not address the relevant charge. 

118In s.300(2), ""use"" involves the actual deployment of the instrument said to be false: Sultan v R [2008] NSWCCA 175, 191 A Crim R 8 at 14 [36]. Here, the Crown alleged (and proved) that the Appellant deployed the cheque which bore a false endorsement. The findings of the trial Judge set out at [27] above make this clear. His Honour found expressly that the signature of Mr Capparelli on the endorsement was forged and that the Appellant knew this to be so.

119It was the Crown case, based on the evidence of Mr Capparelli, Mr Gall and the cheque endorsement (Exhibit T19) that the Appellant presented the cheque to Mr Gall with the endorsement on the reverse, being the purported signature of Mr Capparelli, which he knew to be false. Mr Gall gave evidence that the endorsement, being the purported signature, was present on the cheque at the time the Appellant gave it to him (AB961-963). He was not sure when the words ""Please pay Galloping Press"" were placed on it (AB962).

120It was not the Crown case that only the cheque was false. It was the Crown case that the endorsement, being the purported signature of Mr Capparelli, was the false instrument alleged in Count 6. The trial was conducted on this basis and the Appellant understood what was alleged against him in Count 6.

121In my view, Ground 5 sets up a false premise in that it asserts that the relevant cheque was endorsed ""Please pay Galloping Press"" by a person or persons unknown. It was open to the trial Judge to find beyond reasonable doubt that Count 6 was established upon the basis that the Appellant knew that the endorsement was false. The trial Judge so found. 

122To the extent that Ground 5 may be taken as a contention that the verdict on Count 6 was not supported by the evidence, I record my satisfaction that it was open to the trial Judge, on the whole of the evidence, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant on this count, and state that I would reach the same conclusion. 

123In my view, both Grounds 4 and 5 ought be rejected. 

Ground 6 - The Fresh or New Evidence Ground

124The Appellant asserts that fresh or new evidence is available which bears upon his convictions on Counts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. An affidavit of the Appellant sworn 3 August 2010 was relied upon in support of this ground. The Crown relied upon affidavits of Virginia Maria Boulous sworn 3 August 2012 and 28 February 2013. 

125It was agreed between counsel that there was no need to cross-examine the deponents or for oral evidence to be given with respect to this ground (T27-29, 1 March 2013). The Court was invited to determine the ground by reference to affidavits and other written materials.

The Appellant's Submissions

126This ground focused upon certain documents which were said to be copies of receipts from Mr Capparelli to the Appellant and copies of documents relating to a Mr Williams, solicitor.

127Mr McGovern SC submitted that these documents were provided by the Crown after the 2009 trial, and that they bore upon issues to be determined by the trial Judge at that trial. It was submitted that the documents in question ought to have been produced at an earlier time. 

128It was submitted that the absence of these documents at the time of the trial involved a miscarriage of justice, in that there was a significant possibility that the trial Judge, acting reasonably, would have arrived at a different result had they been available for use at the trial.

Crown Submissions

129The Crown submitted that the documents in question did not constitute fresh or new evidence. The Appellant's own case was that he knew of the existence of the material prior to the trial and sought a permanent stay on that basis, which was refused. Furthermore, in what the Crown described as the rather unusual circumstances of the case, the authenticity of the documents relied upon as new evidence was open to question. 

130The Crown pointed to the affidavit of Ms Boulous, which indicated that the documents in question under this ground of appeal were in fact documents which were already available to the Appellant. It was submitted that the Court would find that the documents had not come into the possession of the Appellant as the result of the delivery of documents by Ms Boulous.

131The Crown submitted that the Appellant had failed to demonstrate that the evidence was fresh or new, let alone that a miscarriage of justice had resulted. 


Decision

132The principles to be applied with respect to a fresh or new evidence ground were summarised by Kirby J (Mason P and Levine J agreeing) in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 at [63]:

""The authorities in respect of fresh evidence have recently been collected and analysed by Giles JA in R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227, and Heydon JA in R v M [2002] NSWCCA 66 at paras 61-64; see also R v Sleiman [2003] NSWCCA 231 paras 101-105. The test was stated by Barwick CJ in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518-520 (McTiernan, Stephen and Jacobs JJ agreeing). It was reaffirmed in Lawless v The Queen (1979) 142 CLR 659 by Mason J at 674-5 (Barwick CJ and Aiken J agreeing). The principles may be summarised as follows: 

* First, a distinction is made between 'new evidence' and 'fresh evidence'. Fresh evidence is evidence not available to the accused at the time of the trial, actually or constructively. Evidence is constructively available if it could have been discovered, or available at the trial by the exercise of due diligence. 

* Second, great latitude must be extended to an accused in determining what evidence, by reasonable diligence, could have been available at his trial (Ratten v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 512). 

* Third, the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial (Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301). 

* Fourth, the issue of whether there has been a miscarriage is to be approached on a number of levels, depending upon the order sought (whether a verdict of acquittal or a new trial), and the capacity of the new or fresh evidence to sustain the order sought. 

* Fifth, where a verdict of acquittal is sought and the new evidence is of such cogency that innocence is shown to the Court's satisfaction, or the Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to guilt, the guilty verdict will be quashed and the appellant discharged. In such circumstances, it does not matter whether the evidence is fresh or simply new (Ratten v The Queen (supra) Barwick CJ at 518/519; cf Gibbs CJ in Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 398/399). 

* Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively:

* Is the evidence fresh?

* If it is, is it 'credible' or at least capable of belief (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Gibbs CJ at 395), or 'plausible' (Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301)?

* If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Brennan J at 410) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused (Gallagher v The Queen (supra) per Mason and Deane JJ at 402)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (supra) per Toohey & Gaudron JJ at 301-302.

* Seventh, the concept of a miscarriage of justice is not an abstract investigation of truth (cf an Inquiry under s474D Crimes Act 1900). It is an investigation in the context of the adversarial nature of a criminal trial. Where deliberate tactical decisions are made on the part of the accused as to the evidence that should or should not be called, and the issues that should or should not be pursued, there is nothing unfair, and there will be no miscarriage, in holding an accused to such decisions, even though it is conceivable that other decisions or something else may have worked rather better (Ratten v The Queen (supra) at 517).""

133The Appellant bears the onus of demonstrating factual matters in support of this ground of appeal.

134In his affidavit, the Appellant asserts that certain documents were included in a cardboard box containing about 4,000 pages delivered to the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre on 22 August 2009, the day following his conviction by the trial Judge. The Appellant asserts that, in that box, were copies of receipts dated 21 June 2003 and 21 July 2003 from Mr Capparelli for receipt of monies from the sale of shares and a copy of a letter from Mr Tom Williams dated 30 October 2003 addressed to Mr Capparelli (affidavit of Appellant sworn 3 August 2010, Annexures J and K).

135The trial Judge had refused a permanent stay application made by the Appellant, during which the Appellant had maintained that documents (including Annexures J and K) had been furnished to Detective Senior Constable Hetherington in January 2005. Detective Senior Constable Hetherington denied that these documents had been taken from the Appellant in January 2005. A list of documents obtained by the police officer from the Appellant on that occasion was tendered on the stay application (Exhibit 7). That list was signed by the Appellant and did not include the documents in question, specifically the documents which are Exhibits J and K to the Appellant's affidavit of 3 August 2010. 

136In the course of refusing the stay application, the trial Judge noted that Mr Williams, solicitor, had been murdered in April 2004. The trial Judge held that the Appellant had not discharged the onus to obtain a permanent stay of the criminal proceedings, even on the assumption that the documents existed. In the course of refusing the stay application, the trial Judge described the Appellant as ""an intelligent, quick-thinking and articulate individual"". 

137The foundation for Ground 6 is the claim that these documents, which had been the subject of the stay application determined in July 2009, suddenly came to light in a large box of documents provided by the Crown to the Appellant in September 2009.

138Ms Boulous was the solicitor in the Office of the Solicitor of Public Prosecutions responsible for the production of these documents in August 2009. 

139The effect of the affidavits of Ms Boulous is that the documents sent to the Appellant was a complete copy of documents received from the Legal Aid Commission by the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the course of preparation of the Appellant's appeal from his conviction at the 2007 trial. Ms Boulous states that she searched the documents from the Legal Aid Commission and that they did not contain the documents upon which the Appellant now seeks to rely on this application. 

140Accordingly, there is no evidence apart from the Appellant's assertion, that the documents in question were produced in August 2009 in the manner asserted by the Plaintiff. In fact, the affidavit of Ms Boulous is contrary to this assertion.

141Further, the trial Judge dealt with the issues raised under this ground on the hearing of the permanent stay application determined prior to the trial. His Honour held that the Appellant had not discharged the onus of demonstrating that the alleged documents, if they existed, were such as to mean that the absence of them from the Court's consideration would mean that a fair trial would not be possible. 

142There are some curious features surrounding this ground. It is necessary to keep in mind the evidence at the trial evidencing a capacity on the part of the Appellant to use documents with a false and misleading letterhead when it suited him to do so. I have in mind, in particular, the use of a letterhead in the name of ""Miller and Associates"" (Counts 2 and 4) which he caused to be created. 

143It is necessary, as well, to keep in mind the absence of any reference to these documents on the list signed by the Appellant in January 2005, on the occasion when Detective Senior Constable Hetherington took a number of documents from him. 

144The evidence of Ms Boulous is that the box of documents furnished by her to the Appellant in August 2009 for the purpose of his appeal from the 2007 trial did not contain Annexures J and K to the Appellant's affidavit sworn 3 August 2010. To the extent that Ground 6 depends upon a finding in the Appellant's favour that the box of documents delivered by Ms Boulous in August 2009 did contain those documents, accompanied by a claim that the Appellant did not already have them (if they then existed), then the Appellant has failed to demonstrate that he received the documents which are Annexures J and K in the box delivered from Ms Boulous in August 2009.

145It is not necessary to explore further the relevant principles with respect to fresh and new evidence, as summarised in R v Abou-Chabake. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the documents which are Annexures J and K were in existence at the time of the 2009 trial, or, if they were, that they were not available to him at that time. 

146To the extent that a critical aspect of this ground of appeal requires a finding in the Appellant's favour that these documents only came to his attention following the 2009 trial when the box of documents was delivered to him in custody, he had failed to establish that these documents were in that box.

147The Appellant has not demonstrated that the suggested fresh or new evidence was credible, nor that it satisfied the test for admission of ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence.

148A result of these findings is that Ground 6 should be rejected. 

Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentences Imposed Following the 2009 Trial

149The Appellant sought to rely upon nine grounds of appeal in support of his application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Knox DCJ following the 2009 trial. Those grounds are as follows:

(a) Ground 7 - The sentencing Judge erred by admitting a victim impact statement into evidence over objection, and thereafter taking that victim impact statement into account as a relevant consideration on sentence, notwithstanding that the offences did not fall within the description of offences contained in s.27(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

(b) Ground 8 - The sentencing Judge erred in law by equating the Appellant's fraud as punishable on the same strict basis as a solicitor would be punished who had defrauded his clients, notwithstanding that the Appellant was neither a solicitor nor a person in a position of trust in respect of any of the offences.

(c) Ground 9 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to take into account the fact that the offending conduct of the Appellant could have been dealt with in the Local Court had the prosecution not elected otherwise, and his Honour ought to have considered this to be a relevant consideration in the exercise of discretion.

(d) Ground 10 - The sentencing Judge erred on sentence by failing to give weight, or any sufficient weight, to substantial delay.

(e) Ground 11 - The sentencing Judge should have taken into account as a mitigating factor, and as necessitating a reduction in the Appellant's sentence, the foreseeability of the Appellant serving his sentence in conditions significantly harsher than those applicable to the general prison population, or alternatively, this Court should take into account the fact that the Appellant is serving his sentence in such conditions such as to necessitate a reduction in the Appellant's sentence.

(f) Ground 12 - The sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was manifestly excessive in regard to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the Appellant's conduct, given the amount involved and the period of offending.

(g) Ground 13 - The sentencing Judge erred in failing to reduce the Appellant's sentence on the ground of assistance to authorities, by not correctly applying s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and by deciding that any information supplied was not of sufficient utility to attract any amelioration or discount by way of mitigation.

(h) Ground 14 - The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account on sentence irrelevant considerations, and made findings on the basis of no evidence, namely that the Appellant's complaint about the non-production of documents at trial was not genuine. His Honour also took into account an irrelevant consideration, that the Appellant had professed and maintained his innocence throughout the trial and on sentence.

(i) Ground 15 - In sentencing the Appellant, his Honour failed to comply with the requirements of Division 5 Pt 4 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

150These grounds will be addressed in turn.

Ground 7 - Claim of Error in Admission of Victim Impact Statement of Mr Capparelli

151Over the objection of the Appellant, the sentencing Judge admitted into evidence on sentence, a victim impact statement of Mr Capparelli dated 29 October 2009. In that statement, Mr Capparelli described the emotional and financial impact upon him and his family as a result of the offences committed by the Appellant.

Submissions

152Mr McGovern SC submits that his Honour erred in admitting the report. He submitted that the victim impact statement was not admissible in sentencing proceedings of this type given the limits contained in s.27(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. To the extent that the sentencing Judge relied upon the decision of this Court in Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145, the Appellant sought to distinguish that case.

153The Crown submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to receive the victim impact statement in this case, relying upon Porter v R. The Crown also submitted that, in any event, the sentencing Judge noted that the statement did not add anything to the view that he had already formed from the evidence given by Mr Capparelli at the trial. The sentencing Judge stated that he would not be relying upon the contents of the statement any further. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated. 

Decision

154As stated in Porter v R at [52]-[53], to succeed on this ground, the Appellant needs to demonstrate that the evidence concerning the emotional and financial consequences of the offences upon Mr Capparelli and his family ought not to have been admitted at all on sentence. The fact that the statement was entitled ""Victim Impact Statement"" does not mean that the content of the statement itself was inadmissible. 

155The Court observed in Porter v R at [54]-[55], that it is well established at common law that loss or damage suffered by a victim is a factor to be taken into account in the sentencing process, citing a number of authorities including Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 565 at 664-666. The purposes of sentencing include recognition of the harm done to the victim of crime and the community: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In Porter v R, the evidence concerned the emotional and financial stress suffered by the proprietors of several small businesses as a result of an arson offence which destroyed their shop premises.

156Sections 26-30A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 do not codify and confine the circumstances in which evidence may be received by a sentencing court of the impact of crimes upon a victim. It was open to the sentencing Judge in this case to receive material which bore upon the question of the emotional and financial impact of the Appellant's crimes upon Mr Capparelli.

157In any event, the sentencing Judge observed that the contents of the statement did not add a great deal more to his own observations of Mr Capparelli, who had given evidence at the trial. Clearly, it was open to the sentencing Judge to have regard to the evidence of Mr Capparelli at trial in his assessment of sentence of the Appellant. That evidence allowed his Honour to take into account the substantial (and understandable) emotional and financial impact of these offences upon Mr Capparelli and his family.

158I would reject Ground 7.

Ground 8 - Claim of Error in Treating the Appellant as a Solicitor on Sentence

Submissions

159Mr McGovern SC submitted that, although the sentencing Judge correctly identified the fraud as involving the Appellant representing himself as a solicitor, he erred in having regard to the ""strict sanctions against solicitors who defraud their clients"" and in observing that that approach ""should apply at least no less to those who fraudulently represent themselves to be solicitors who carry out the same activities"" (AB27). 

160It was submitted that his Honour approached sentence upon the basis that a harsher penalty was warranted for the Appellant than would otherwise have been warranted for a person in his position: Nikolaidis v R [2008] NSWCCA 323; 191 A Crim R 556 at 574-575 [94]-[96]. The Appellant submitted that it was wrong for the sentencing Judge to impose a harsher sentence on the Appellant by treating him as if he were a solicitor. 

161The Crown submitted that it was necessary to view the totality of the sentencing Judge's remarks on this topic. When so viewed, it was submitted that his Honour was not approaching the question of sentence as if the Appellant was a solicitor, with an accompanying breach of trust.

Decision

162In addressing this ground, it is necessary to fairly read the entirety of what the sentencing Judge said on this topic. His Honour said (AB25):

""In my view the offender held himself out to be a solicitor and Mr Capparelli relied on him as being a person who he could trust in that capacity. However I do not think there is, as the term is defined and as counsel both agree, a breach of trust in the circumstances of this particular matter.""

163His Honour found that the Appellant's scheme was ""a complex and relatively sophisticated fraud"", with the level of planning and premeditation being demonstrated by a number of factors enumerated by the sentencing Judge (AB26). 

164His Honour returned to the topic (AB27-28):

""The criminality involved was serious, planned and premeditated and involved a range of institutions and individuals; all of who relied on the offender or the documents provided. He had armed himself with documentation and created an impression carefully designed to ensure that he was regarded as a solicitor and a professional person who could be trusted. While it may be technically correct to say that as he was not a solicitor, he was not a person who was in a position of trust, nevertheless that is precisely the impression he intended to give and the ostensible relationship on which his fraudulent activities were based.

The legislature has provided strict sanctions against solicitors who defraud their clients. It does seem to me that approach should apply at least no less to those who fraudulently represent themselves to be solicitors and carry out the same activities.

There are difference in principle and policy as Mr Pickin of counsel has submitted. Namely, that people who are solicitors have effectively a licence by virtue of their admission and an expectation of trust that did not apply to the offender. Nevertheless here this was precisely what the offender was trying to do.""

165It is the second paragraph in the last-mentioned quotation upon which the Appellant relies in support of this ground. 

166Finally, the sentencing Judge stated (AB29-30):

""I say that against the background of the finding that I made during the trial and which I subsequently reiterate; that the offender is a highly intelligent individual. On his own evidence corroborated by the presentence report, he is someone who has had the benefit of a substantial part of a legal education and some legal experience. He used that experience to lend colour, if not veracity, to the impression he wanted to create on Mr Capparelli. He set up an elaborate subterfuge involving documents representing the existence of a separate legal entity and making representations to agencies such as HIP that were entitled to rely on the representations and documents advanced.""

167I am not satisfied that the sentencing Judge approached the present sentencing exercise as if the Appellant was a solicitor, with the full panoply of factors to be taken into account on sentence in that scenario having application to the Appellant. 

168Rather, his Honour had regard to the serious aspects of the Appellant's offences whereby he deceived Mr Capparelli into believing that he was a solicitor, and thereby entrusted his affairs to him. As his Honour observed, both specific and general deterrence were significant factors on sentence for conduct of this type. This reflected the importance of deterring others in the community from falsely representing themselves to be solicitors, thereby deceiving members of the public for criminal purposes, including (as in this case) a vulnerable and elderly citizen.

169The present case is different from Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70, where it was said (at [22]-[27]) that the aggravating factor of breach of trust is not made out simply because the victim trusted the offender for some reason, or because of the offender's standing in the community or his appearance of being a successful businessman. The position of trust recognised by the common law does not arise simply from the subjective state of mind of one of the members of the relationship. 

170However, that is not the present case. Here, Mr Capparelli trusted the Appellant because he believed, as a result of the Appellant's false statements, that he was a solicitor who would act on behalf of Mr Capparelli. The approach of the sentencing Judge in the present case does not involve any breach of the approach taken by this Court in Suleman v R. 

171The approach adopted by the sentencing Judge, as his Honour made clear, did not involve equating the Appellant's conduct with a breach of trust by a member of the legal profession. Rather, the aggravating aspects of the offences, and the emphasis upon specific and general deterrence, flowed from the grave consequences where a criminal deceives a member of the public into entrusting his or her affairs to that person under the guise of being a solicitor. 

172I reject Ground 8.

Ground 9 - Claim of Error in Failing to Take Into Account Possibility of Summary Disposal

Submissions

173Mr McGovern SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had erred in not taking into account on sentence the fact that the charges against the Appellant could have been disposed of summarily in the Local Court. It was submitted that his Honour should have taken this factor into account, together with the jurisdictional limit of sentence in the Local Court if the matters had been disposed of summarily. Reliance was sought to be based upon sentencing statistics with respect to offences under the relevant sections dealt with summarily in the Local Court. 

174The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge did take into account the submission concerning possible summary disposal, but rejected it in the circumstances of this case upon the basis that the matters were properly brought in the District Court.

Decision

175The sentencing Judge concluded that these were proper matters to be brought in the District Court by way of an election by the Director of Public Prosecutions ""for good reason"" (AB38). 

176In the present case, the Director of Public Prosecutions elected for these matters to be tried on indictment. A decision of that type lies within the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 

177This Court has held that it would require a very clear case of inappropriate prosecution of an offence on indictment, before the availability of summary disposal could provide an argument in mitigation resulting from what was said to be the lost opportunity for summary disposal of an offence: R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at 47 [86]; Khanwaiz v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 at [132]-[134]; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at 480-482 [100]-[102].

178Unless this Court is able to clearly determine that the offence in question ought to have remained in the Local Court, then the argument is theoretical at best. The bare theoretical possibility of a matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice: Zreika v R at 483 [109].

179The present offences were serious examples of breaches of ss.178BA, 178BB and 300(2) Crimes Act 1900. The Appellant has fallen far short of demonstrating that the prosecution of these offences should appropriately have taken place in the Local Court, so as to give rise to a viable argument that the theoretical possibility of summary disposal was a factor which ought to have been taken into account in his favour on sentence.

180I reject Ground 9.

Ground 10 - Claim That No Weight or No Sufficient Weight Was Given to Substantial Delay

Submissions

181The Appellant submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to give weight, or appropriate weight, to the delay between his arrest in January 2005 and his conviction by the trial Judge in August 2009. 

182The Crown noted that his Honour had dealt with the issue of delay at some length in his remarks on sentence, and that no error had been demonstrated in his Honour's approach on this issue. 

Decision

183The sentencing Judge considered the submissions made on sentence with respect to delay (AB33-37). It is not necessary to recite the chronology of events set out by his Honour. There is no doubt that his Honour considered them on sentence. 

184His Honour had regard to the relevant principles in R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519 and Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 59. His Honour had regard to the reasons for delay, noting that the delays did not seem to have been caused by any undue police or prosecutorial delay, with much of the delay being attributable to the Appellant. His Honour concluded that the delay was not such that it should be taken into account to mitigate penalty.

185This Court is a court of error. The sentencing Judge considered the submissions made on sentence with respect to delay and reached a conclusion which was open to him. No error has been demonstrated in this respect. 

186I would reject Ground 10.

Ground 11 - Claim of Error in Approach to Appellant's Custodial Conditions

Submissions

187Mr McGovern SC submitted that the sentencing Judge erred in his approach to the Appellant's assistance to authorities, and what was said to be the consequential increased hardship of his custodial conditions as a result of that assistance. 

188The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated as asserted in this ground. No relevant evidence had been placed before the sentencing court, nor did there appear to have been any actual submission made to his Honour that he should reduce sentence on this basis. Rather, it was submitted that his Honour should take this aspect into account in finding special circumstances. 

Decision

189His Honour's remarks on sentence of 11 December 2009 indicate that the issue of assistance had been raised with respect to sentence. However, a perusal of the transcript of the sentencing proceedings, and his Honour's remarks on sentence, indicates that no satisfactory evidentiary basis had been demonstrated that assistance of any real utility had been provided, let alone what the impact of that may be upon the Appellant's custodial conditions. These are matters for evidence and not assumption by a sentencing court. 

190This ground may be disposed of briefly by stating that no error has been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge with respect to this issue.

191I would reject Ground 11.

Ground 13 - Claim of Error in Approach to Appellant's Suggested Assistance to Authorities

Submissions

192The Appellant contends that he had an entitlement to a reduction in sentence for the purpose of s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 because of his claim of assistance to authorities. The Appellant contends further that the sentencing Judge erred in deciding that the information supplied by him was not of sufficient utility to attract any assistance to the Appellant on sentence. 

193The Appellant contended that he was entitled to be rewarded for what was said to be his genuine co-operation with the authorities: LMN v R [2012] NSWCCA 52 at [27].

194The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge's finding as to the lack of utility of the Appellant's assistance was open and in accordance with evidence given by a senior police officer.

Decision

195The sentencing Judge provided an opportunity for assessment of the Appellant's claimed assistance to authorities by adjourning the sentencing proceedings from 27 November 2009 to 11 December 2009. On that occasion, evidence was given by a senior police officer, the effect of which was that the Appellant's assistance was of no practical value. 

196The sentencing Judge had regard to the material before the Court with respect to the claim of assistance to authorities as a factor bearing on sentence. As was stated in LMN v R at [28], the value of information provided remains an important consideration and can inform the Court's assessment of the degree of genuine co-operation being offered.

197It was open to the sentencing Judge to conclude that no discount ought be extended to the Appellant under s.23 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The Appellant has not demonstrated error in this respect.

198I would reject Ground 13.

Ground 14 - Claim that the Sentencing Judge Took Into Account Irrelevant Considerations and Made Findings on the Basis of No Evidence

Submissions

199This ground is based upon the contention that crucial documents of an exculpatory nature had not been produced to the Court, yet the sentencing Judge determined that the Appellant's complaints about non-production of documents had not been genuine. It was submitted that, in these circumstances, it was erroneous for the sentencing Judge to have drawn a conclusion adverse to the Appellant on this question when subsequent events demonstrated that the Appellant's claim was correct.

200It was submitted further that his Honour should not have taken into account in a manner unfavourable to the Appellant the fact that he had maintained his innocence during the trial: Siganto v The Queen. 

201The Crown submitted that the factual premise for the submission concerning non-production of documents was wrong. Further, evidence had been given during the trial on this issue and the sentencing Judge had made adverse findings concerning the credibility of the Appellant. This was said to be relevant to sentence, particularly in relation to the issue of delay and how delay should impact on the sentence imposed.

202The Crown submitted there was no basis for the complaint that the sentencing Judge had taken into account, adversely to the Appellant, the fact that he had maintained his innocence.

Decision

203In determining Ground 6 (the fresh or new evidence ground), I have concluded that the Appellant did not establish that the documentary material was credible, nor that it was fresh or new.

204The factual foundation for the first submission advanced by the Appellant under this ground is not established. 

205A fair reading of the remarks on sentence does not demonstrate that the sentencing Judge has breached the principle in Siganto v The Queen. The fact that the sentencing Judge referred to the Appellant maintaining his innocence throughout does not demonstrate that that feature was taken into account adversely to him on sentence. 

206Clearly, the Appellant was not entitled to any of the benefits which flow by way of discount for a plea of guilty and any additional assistance on sentence by way of contrition and remorse in the circumstances of this case. The statements of the sentencing Judge go no further than this. 

207I would reject Ground 13. 
 
Ground 14 - Failing to Fix a Non-Parole Period on Count 3

Submissions

208The Appellant complains that the sentencing Judge failed to set a non-parole period on Count 3 and thus failed to comply with provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

209It was further submitted that, although the sentencing Judge appears to have intended to make an adjustment for special circumstances, this did not happen when sentence was imposed. 

210The Crown acknowledged that the sentencing Judge did not use the words ""non-parole period"" in sentencing for Count 3, but that his Honour's intention was clear and that that was what was meant. Further, the Crown submitted that a finding of special circumstances had been made and was taken into account in passing sentence. 

Decision

211In passing sentence on Count 3, his Honour sentenced the Appellant to ""a term of three years' imprisonment commencing on 11 June 2010 and expiring on 10 June 2013 with an additional term of 18 months expiring on 10 December 2014"" (AB50). It is quite clear that this was a slip on the part of the sentencing Judge. His Honour intended to impose a non-parole period of three years on Count 3, as the complete form of order made clear. Further, neither the Crown Prosecutor or defence counsel, who had appeared throughout the proceedings, raised any issue with the sentencing Judge concerning this order.

212His Honour made a finding of special circumstances by reference to the Appellant's age and background and partial accumulation (AB41-42). 

213The sentences ultimately passed involved fixed terms of imprisonment on Counts 2, 4, 5 and 6, as to which no complaint is made on behalf of the Appellant. On the remaining count, Count 3, a total sentence of imprisonment for four years and six months with a non-parole period of three years was passed. Practical effect was given to the findings of special circumstances.

214I reject Ground 15.

Ground 12 - Claim of Manifest Excess

215It is appropriate to consider this ground last.

Submissions

216Mr McGovern SC contended that a total effective sentence of imprisonment for four years and six months was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case. No complaint was made concerning the entirely concurrent sentences upon Counts 2, 4, 5 and 6. The focus of the Appellant's submissions was Count 3, which attracted a head sentence of imprisonment for four years and six months, with a non-parole period of three years. 

217The Crown noted the indication of the sentencing Judge on 27 November 2009, which may have suggested that his Honour intended to impose concurrent sentences on Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5, with a longer sentence on Count 6, which involved different criminality and a greater maximum penalty. When the sentencing proceedings resumed on 11 December 2009, the matter proceeded ultimately by way of imposition of concurrent sentences on Counts 2, 4, 5 and 6, with an additional and lengthier sentence on Count 3. 

218The Crown submitted that the sentences were not manifestly excessive given the Appellant's offences.

Decision

219An examination of the record of the sentencing proceedings does suggest an apparent intention on the part of the sentencing Judge on 27 November 2009 to impose the longer sentence on Count 6. The sentencing proceedings were adjourned to 11 December 2009 to allow an assessment of the value of assistance said to have been provided to the authorities by the Appellant, an assessment which did not materially assist the Appellant on sentence. 

220On 11 December 2009, his Honour imposed the sentences outlined at [6]. It is noteworthy that both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel who had appeared at trial were present on this occasion, and that no point was raised by either counsel with respect to the course of action taken by the sentencing Judge in this respect. Neither counsel suggested to his Honour that the course adopted was inconsistent with that suggested on 27 November 2009.

221Ground 12, as drawn, invites consideration of all sentences imposed upon the Appellant. As argued, the ground has focused upon the sentence fixed on Count 3. I accept that a sentence of imprisonment of four years and six months with respect to Count 3, which carried a maximum of five years' imprisonment, was a very substantial sentence. Viewed in isolation, the conclusion may be open that the sentence for that offence is manifestly excessive. 

222However, Ground 12 is directed to totality (as the Appellant's written submissions indicate) so that regard should be had to the Appellant's total criminality for all offences in considering this ground. 

223I am not persuaded that a total effective head sentence of four years and six months is manifestly excessive for all the offences committed by the Appellant. To the extent that Ground 12 so contends, I reject the claim of manifest excess.

224The narrow argument advanced is that the sentence on Count 3 was really intended for Count 6, which carried a higher maximum penalty. 

225Unless the Appellant can make good a submission that any restructured sentences would be shorter than those imposed, there is no practical utility in resentencing: Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 at [90]. I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence (or sentences) would be appropriate in this case. Accordingly, the Appellant has not made good this ground.

226I reject Ground 12. 

Conclusion Concerning 2009 Appeal

227The Appellant has failed to make good any of his grounds of appeal against conviction at the 2009 trial.

228Further, the Appellant has failed to establish any of his grounds of appeal with respect to sentence following the 2009 trial. Even if error had been demonstrated with respect to sentence, I would not have been persuaded in any event that lesser sentences were warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

229I propose the following orders with respect to the appeal from the 2009 trial:

(a) appeal against conviction dismissed;

(b) leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed.

Appeal from the 2007 Trial

230Brief reference was made at [2]-[3] above to the charges of which the Appellant was convicted following a trial in 2007 before Armitage ADCJ and a jury, and the sentences imposed following those verdicts. 

231The Appellant stood trial with John Duncan Copeland upon the following charges:

(a) Count 1 - Between 1 July 2003 and 4 February 2004, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, by deception, namely by presenting material for the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited representing that they were acting on behalf of a person named Ivan Pagett, who desired a sum of money against the security of a property at 105 Links Avenue, Concord, and that the said Ivan Pagett was capable of meeting the repayments of that loan, dishonestly obtained for himself and each other a financial advantage, namely two bank cheques totalling the sum of $769,639.58 (s.178BA Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for five years).

(b) Count 2 - Between 12 September 2003 and 4 February 2004, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, namely a document purporting to be a photocopy of pages from Australian Passport [XXX], of Heavy Vehicle Drivers Licence [XXX], and of images of Ivan Pagett, a document that the Appellant knew to be false, with the intention of inducing another person, namely the proper officer of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, to accept the instrument as genuine, and because of that acceptance, to do an act, namely to place a sum of $800,000.00 to the credit of the said Ivan Pagett, to the prejudice of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (s.300(2) the Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years).

(c) Count 3 - Between 12 September 2003 and 4 February 2004, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, namely, a document purporting to bear the details of Personal Cheque account [XXX], for the month of July 2003, in respect of Ivan Pagett of 105 Links Avenue, Concord, a document that the Appellant knew to be false, with the intention of inducing another person, namely the proper officer of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, to accept the instrument as genuine, and because of that acceptance, to do an act, namely to place the sum of $800,000.00 to the credit of the said Ivan Pagett, to the prejudice of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years).

(d) Count 4 - Between 12 September 2003 and 4 February 2004, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, namely a document purporting to be the PAYG Payment Summary - Individual Non-Business, in respect of Ivan Pagett (payee [XXX]), for the period 01/07/2002 to 30 June 2003, purported to have been signed by Walter Cosgrove on 9 July 2003, a document that the Appellant knew to be false with the intention of inducing another person, namely the proper officer of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, to accept the instrument as genuine, and because of that acceptance, to do an act, namely to place a sum of $800,000.00 to the credit of Ivan Pagett, to the prejudice of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years).

(e) Count 5 - Between 12 September 2003 and 4 February 2004, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, namely a letter of employment in respect of Ivan K Pagett, bearing the date 12 December 2003, purporting to have been signed by Walter Cosgrove, Drain Savers (Homebush), a document that the Appellant knew to be false, with the intention of inducing another person, namely the proper officer of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, to accept the instrument as genuine, and because of that acceptance, to do an act, namely to place a sum of $800,000.00 to the credit of the said Ivan Pagett, to the prejudice of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years). 

232On 28 June 2007, the jury convicted the Appellant on all counts and acquitted Mr Copeland on all counts. 

The Crown Case Against the Appellant

233It was the Crown case that the Appellant was the author of a carefully planned fraud, to present false documentation, either totally fabricated, or modified to make false representations of its authenticity, to dishonestly deprive the ANZ Bank of about $770,000.00 and interest on that money. 

234Of this sum, the Appellant received the proceeds of a $759,739.58 cheque, by way of $650,000.00 in cash and an 80% share in the ownership of a racehorse. The fraud involved utilising as security the home of Ivan Pagett, then aged about 74 years and suffering physical impairment. 

235The scheme continued from its inception in about July 2003 to its fruition in obtaining $650,000.00 in cash on 4 February 2004. 

236The Appellant denied the charges and denied that he received the sum of $650,000.00.

237In his remarks on sentence of 14 September 2007, Armitage ADCJ stated (AB189-190):

""The crown case as presented at the trial was that the two accused between 1 July 2003 and 4 February 2004 acted together in a joint criminal enterprise of practising a deception of the Australia and New Zealand Bank both by way of verbal and documentary representations that they knew to be false in order to obtain a sum of $769,639.58 to be shared between them. There was no dispute at the trial that deceptive representations were made and false documents were presented by Mr Copeland and a person who pretended to be John Harris, solicitor and that the deception resulted in a loss to the bank and a financial advantage to Mr Copeland and to the person who pretended to be John Harris, solicitor.

The main issues at the trial were, was Mr Damon Miller the person who pretended to be John Harris and was Mr Copeland aware that the person who called himself John Harris was an impostor pretending to be a solicitor acting for a genuine client?

It is apparent from the jury's verdict that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Miller was the person who pretended to be John Harris but was not satisfied that Mr Copeland was aware that the person pretending to be John Harris was an impostor.""

238A more detailed recital of the evidence appears later in the judgment, in the context of determining Ground 1, a claim that the verdicts were unreasonable (at [353]ff). 

Grounds of Appeal Against Conviction of 2007 Trial

239The Appellant's grounds of appeal against conviction with respect to the 2007 trial were contained in a document filed on 24 November 2008 (AB1-8). Written submissions were filed on 25 February 2009 on behalf of the Appellant in support of these grounds. The Crown filed written submissions on 27 August 2009 responding to those submissions.

240Reference was made earlier in this judgment (at [7]-[13]) to the procedural history of the 2007 and 2009 appeals. At the hearing of the appeals on 1 March 2013, oral submissions were made by the Appellant in support of his appeal against conviction and sentence at the 2007 trial, to be taken in conjunction with the written submissions filed in 2009. 

241The grounds of appeal filed on 24 November 2008 concerning the 2007 trial are lengthy and, to some extent, repetitive. The grounds of appeal against conviction may be summarised as follows:

(a) Ground 1 - The convictions were unreasonable having regard to the evidence.

(b) Ground 2 - The Crown circumstantial case comprised fabricated evidence, suborned witness testimony and a manifestly deficient investigation by the police informant, Detective Senior Constable Raymond Hetherington.

(c) Ground 3 - There was no competent investigation by the police informant or discovery in the police brief of evidence of pertinent matters said to have been exculpatory of the Appellant, with 19 categories referred to in this respect.

(d) Ground 4 - The trial Judge erred in that he failed to direct a verdict of acquittal in the Crown circumstantial case concerning the charges of using false instruments (Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5) as:

(i) the entirety of the circumstantial case lacked probative force;

(ii) the totality of the evidence was incapable of carrying with it an inference that the Appellant made or used false instruments of such force that ""it could not reasonably be gain said"";

(iii) there was no evidence that could be taken into account by the jury that was amenable to assessment or capable of affording a guilty verdict.

(e) Ground 5 - The trial Judge erred in that he failed to direct a verdict of acquittal in the Crown case concerning the obtaining of money by deception as (Count 1):

(i) a reasonable jury, in considering its verdict, could not resolve the disparity and repugnancy between the oral evidence of Raymond Gall with written recitals made by him in exhibited documents (with elaboration upon this proposition being contained in the ground);

(ii) the oral evidence provided by Crown witnesses Raymond Gall, Brett Gall, Brian Purkiss and George Dasios was a manifest fabrication, having no rational or sensible content by reference to usual business and commercial practices of the kind that attended the charges.

(f) Ground 6 - The trial Judge failed to adequately direct the jury in respect of evidence concerning the charges of using false instruments, by reference a number of propositions which were advanced at trial on behalf of the Appellant.

(g) Ground 7 - The trial Judge erred in law by permitting the Crown to adduce identification and related evidence concerning the Appellant under s.114 Evidence Act 1995 or in the exercise of his discretion prejudicing the defence case (in certain ways described in the ground).

(h) Ground 8 - The Appellant was assailed and unfairly prejudiced in the preparation of his defence by the decision of the trial Judge to admit into evidence a third witness statement of George Dasios made after the trial commenced, and oral evidence therefrom, (in a manner further described in the ground).

(i) Ground 9 - Counsel for the Appellant failed to advance all pertinent and cogent evidence in his examination of Crown witnesses and the Appellant, and in his submissions to the jury that was provided to him on instructions prior to the jury that was exculpatory to the Appellant (with certain categories of material described in the ground).

(j) Ground 10 - The trial Judge erred in the exercise of his discretion prejudicing the defence case by admitting documentary evidence, not discovered in the Crown brief, that was capable through forensic documentary examination of providing evidence that was exculpatory of the Appellant to the effect that Brett Gall forged the signature of the Appellant on documents relating to the alleged purchase and registration with Racing NSW of the thoroughbred racehorse ""Manor Born"".

(k) Ground 11 - The Appellant asserts that a witness, Charles Miller, was not reasonably available and was able to give evidence which constitutes fresh evidence (described in the ground). 

(l) Ground 12 - The combined and cumulative effect of each of the grounds of appeal has caused a serious miscarriage of justice.

(m) Ground 13 - The convictions are unsafe and unsatisfactory and in all of the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice.

Some Observations Concerning the Function of this Court and the Grounds of Appeal

242Earlier in this judgment (at [31]ff), reference was made to principles governing an appeal to this Court against conviction. Those comments were made in the context of the appeal from the 2009 trial, a trial by Judge alone. The 2007 trial was a jury trial. 

243However, the framework for appeals to this Court is no different. This Court is not conducting a rehearing. It is a court of error operating within the confines of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

244The lengthy grounds of appeal relied upon by the Appellant will be approached within the confines of permissible appellate examination by this Court under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

245It is appropriate to note the requirement for leave to appeal on any ground except one which involves a question of law alone: s.5(1)(a) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; Still v R at [8]. The decision whether leave to appeal ought be granted upon a particular ground involves an assessment of the arguability of this ground. The question of leave will be addressed when considering each ground of appeal. 

246Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules will also arise for consideration with respect to several grounds (see [38] above).

247I turn now to consider the grounds of appeal. Grounds 1 and 13 (which are effectively identical) will be considered last.

Ground 2 - Claim that the Crown Case was Based Upon Fabricated Evidence, Suborned Witness Testimony and a Manifestly Deficient Investigation

Submissions

248Under this ground, and the written submissions in support of it, the Appellant advanced a number of claims concerning Detective Senior Constable Raymond Hetherington and his investigation of the matters of which the Appellant was convicted at trial. The written submission lists allegations by topic without any indication that these matters were ventilated at the trial. 

249The Crown submits that there is no evidence to support the allegations asserted in the Appellant's written submissions. Insofar as the written submissions refer to an investigation of Detective Senior Constable Hetherington by the Professional Standards Command of the NSW Police Force, the Crown submits that there is no evidence of any adverse finding made against the police officer in this respect. 

250The Crown submits that the balance of the allegations contained in the ground, that evidence was fabricated and false evidence was given, are not supported by evidence.

Decision

251The Appellant requires leave to advance this ground of appeal, which is not based upon a question of law alone. An assessment of the arguability of the ground may be undertaken briefly.

252The ground, and submissions made in support of it, make strong allegations without evidentiary support. It is clear that a significant contest arose at the trial concerning the credibility and reliability of a number of witnesses, with the jury determining these issues adversely to the Appellant. 

253No evidentiary foundation (based upon the trial) is advanced which supports a hypothesis that Crown witnesses had been suborned or influenced in any way to give false or misleading evidence against the Appellant. It is not apparent that any suggestion along these lines was made by experienced counsel who appeared on behalf of the Appellant at trial.

254The Appellant has not demonstrated that Ground 2 is sufficiently arguable to warrant a grant of leave to advance it. I would refuse leave to the Appellant to rely upon Ground 2. 

Ground 3 - Claim That No Competent Investigation Was Undertaken by the Police Concerning the Appellant 

Submissions

255Ground 3 involves a claim by the Appellant that there was no competent investigation by police of matters said to be exculpatory of the Appellant in 19 specified areas. It is not necessary to list the 19 areas in this judgment. The complaints appear to touch almost every aspect of the charges brought against the Appellant. 

256The Appellant's written submissions refer to a variety of aspects of the case, culminating in the submission that a competent investigation by the police would have revealed evidence exculpatory of the Appellant and that the failure of the officer-in-charge to do so arose ""from conspiratorial and duplicitous activities on his part"". 

257The Crown submitted that there was no evidence to support this ground. Detective Senior Constable Hetherington had been cross-examined by defence counsel at trial, and no allegation of misconduct involving alleged conspiracy and duplicity was suggested to him. 

Decision

258Once again, the Appellant requires leave to rely upon this ground of appeal. It is a variation on the theme raised in Ground 2. In my view, it suffers from the same defect as that ground.

259It was open to trial counsel for the Appellant to cross-examine Detective Senior Constable Hetherington upon matters properly arising and relevant to the trial. The police officer was cross-examined at trial, and allegations of the type raised in the grounds and the Appellant's submissions were not advanced. 

260The ground is advanced without evidence to support it. I note that some of the matters complained of in Ground 3 are picked up, in one form of another, in later grounds (such as Grounds 9 and 11). Those grounds will be addressed in turn.

261I would refuse the Appellant leave to rely upon Ground 3. 

Ground 4 - Failure to Direct a Verdict of Acquittal in Respect of Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 - The Charges Under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900

Submissions

262The Appellant complains with respect to the failure by the trial Judge to direct verdicts of acquittal upon the charges of using false instruments under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900. It is submitted that the entirety of the Crown circumstantial case lacked probative force. Submissions were made, by reference to the facts of the case, culminating in the contention that the Crown case was founded on a basis of fabrication and contrivance.

263The Crown notes that no application was made by counsel for the Appellant at the close of the Crown case for verdicts by direction on the s.300(2) counts. In any event, the Crown submits that there was a clear case to be left to the jury on these counts.

Decision

264This ground of appeal asserts that there ought to have been a verdict of acquittal on Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5. On its face, the ground raises a question of law alone, so that leave is not required under s.5(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

265The Crown case involved a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. As will be seen when the unreasonable verdicts ground is addressed, there was a strong body of circumstantial evidence linking the Appellant to the documents and events which were the subject of Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

266A ground of this type must be approached in accordance with principles stated by Dunford J (Greg James J agreeing) in R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377; 48 NSWLR 101 at 130 [127]:

""In determining whether there is a case to answer, the question to be decided is not whether on the evidence as it stands, the accused ought to be convicted, but whether on the evidence as it stands, he could lawfully be convicted: May v O'Sullivan (1995) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In considering such an application, the judge does not consider the probative value of the evidence as a whole, but only that evidence which, if believed and uncontradicted, could be accepted as proof of the Crown case: R v Towers (1984) 14 A Crim R 12 at 14, Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 214-215, R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; and in a case of circumstantial evidence, such as the present, a finding of no case to answer is not open if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused can be convicted, even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be postulated: R v JMR (1991) 39 A Crim R 39 at 44.""

267The Crown case against the Appellant on these counts was largely a circumstantial one. The Appellant is simply incapable of making good a submission that the trial Judge (although not asked to do so) ought to have directed verdicts of acquittal on the counts under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900. There was ample evidence adduced by the Crown for each count to be left to the jury.

268I reject Ground 4.
 
Ground 5 - Alleged Failure by Trial Judge to Direct a Verdict of Acquittal on Count 1 - The s.178BA Crimes Act 1900 Count

Submissions

269The Appellant makes submissions in support of this ground of appeal by reference to claimed deficiencies in the evidence. He contended that:

(a) the entirety of the circumstantial case lacked probative force;

(ii) the totality of the evidence was incapable of carrying with it an inference that the Appellant made or used false instruments of such force that ""it could not reasonably be gain said"".

270The Crown notes, once again, that trial counsel for the Appellant made no application for a verdict by direction on the s.178BA Crimes Act 1900 count. In any event, the Crown submits that there was a clear case to be left to the jury on this count.

Decision

271No application for a directed verdict was sought at trial. 

272The Crown case involved a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence. The submissions advanced by the Appellant involve factual issues which are not capable of satisfying the principles in R v Serratore. 

273I reject Ground 5. 
 
Ground 6 - Claimed Failure on the Part of the Trial Judge to Give Adequate Directions to Jury Concerning Evidence Bearing Upon Charges under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900

Submissions

274The ground of appeal, and submissions made in support of it, contain complaints by the Appellant that the trial Judge failed to adequately direct the jury in a number of respects with regard to these counts. The topics identified by the Appellant include alleged deficiencies in the investigation and other argumentative statements reflecting the Appellant's perspective of the issues in the trial. 

275The Crown notes that no complaint was made, or redirection sought, on behalf of the Appellant at trial in the areas raised in this ground. It was submitted that leave ought be refused under Rule 4. 

276The Crown submitted, in any event, that the directions raised by this ground would not have been given at trial. The adequacy of the police investigation was not a live issue at the trial. Further, findings of fact, including the credit of Raymond Gall, were entirely within the domain of the jury. 

277The Crown noted that the jury had been properly directed with respect to circumstantial evidence.

Decision

278The Appellant requires leave to appeal under Rule 4 to rely upon this ground (see [38] above). 

279I accept the submissions for the Crown that the matters complained of under this ground, to the extent they were ventilated at trial, were issues of fact for the jury. No further direction was sought by trial counsel for the Appellant on the matters raised. The summing up of the trial Judge reminded the jury of submissions made by defence counsel. The Appellant has not demonstrated a foundation for a grant of leave under Rule 4.

280I would refuse the Appellant leave to rely upon Ground 6.

Ground 7 - Claim of Error in Admission of Identification Evidence Under s.114 Evidence Act 1995

281This ground of appeal relates to the admission of identification evidence from Mr George Dasios, which was the subject of a ruling by the trial Judge after counsel for the Appellant had applied for its exclusion (T529-533, AB1076-1080; judgment of 22 June 2007 attached to Crown submissions). 

282Mr Dasios was the manager of the South Hurstville branch of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in February 2004. He gave evidence identifying the Appellant as one of the persons involved in the transaction at the Bank when the sum of $650,000.00 was withdrawn. The evidence of Mr Dasios on the voir dire included evidence that he had seen the Appellant on a number of occasions, including in about mid-2005 when a person with whom Mr Dasios was walking in the street at Burwood approached the Appellant and said to him, ""Damon Miller, where have you been""?

283The point which called for a ruling by the trial Judge was whether visual identification evidence could be given by Mr Dasios. The issue was whether the Appellant had refused to take part in an identification parade: s.114(2)(c) Evidence Act 1995.

284The trial Judge found that in the course of an electronically recorded interview with police on 20 January 2005, the Appellant had been asked to take part in an identification parade, but that he declined to do so. The submission made at first instance was that the Appellant's refusal to take part in an identification parade was confined to one event only, and did not extend to the events which were the subject of the trial of the Appellant. 

285The trial Judge found that the questioning of Detective Senior Constable Hetherington offered the Appellant an identification parade in relation to this alleged fraud, and that it was apparent that the Appellant rejected that offer. 

286The trial Judge found that the probative value of the challenged evidence was substantial, and that the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant was minimal. The evidence was admitted. 

Submissions

287In support of this ground, the Appellant points to some parts of the record of interview with police on 20 January 2005. He submits that the evidence should not have been admitted at trial and that it was substantially prejudicial to the Appellant in the preparation of his defence. 

288The Appellant submitted further that, had he known identification evidence was to be given by Mr Dasios, he would have arranged for his father, Charles Miller, to be present at Court to give evidence on this aspect. This matter gave rise to a separate ground of appeal (Ground 11). 

289The Crown submitted that the Appellant's written submissions had quoted selectively from his record of interview with police on 20 January 2005. It was submitted that it was clearly open to the trial Judge to find that the Appellant refused to participate in an identification parade, so that there was no error identified in the trial Judge's findings.

290With respect to the Appellant's claim of prejudice arising from the decision to admit the evidence of Mr Dasios, the Crown pointed out that at no time during the trial did the Appellant seek an adjournment, or a discharge of the jury, on the basis that he sought to call his father to give evidence. 

Decision

291This ground of appeal seeks to challenge a ruling of the trial Judge that the Appellant had refused to take part in an identification parade on 20 January 2005, so as to open the door to admissibility of visual identification evidence for the purpose of s.114(2)(c) Evidence Act 1995. The trial Judge found that the answers given by the Appellant, in response to the invitation to take part in an identification parade on 20 January 2005, constituted such a refusal. 

292I accept the Crown submission that the Appellant has quoted selectively from the answers given by him in that interview. Fairly read, the series of questions and answers disclose a level of prevarication on the part of the Appellant on the topic of an identification parade, in circumstances where it was well open to the trial Judge to conclude that the request was for the Appellant to take part in an identification parade in relation to an alleged fraud on the ANZ Bank, being the subject matter of this trial. The Appellant's proposed construction of the questions and answers during the interview on this topic is, in my view, tortured and unrealistic.

293Having found that the Appellant refused to take part in an identification parade, the requirement in s.114(2)(c) Evidence Act 1995 was met. Thereafter, the trial Judge considered the probative value of the evidence, and the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant, and proceeded to admit the evidence. No error has been demonstrated in this decision-making process.

294The Appellant's claim of prejudice arising from the absence of Charles Miller to give evidence at trial will be addressed more fully with respect to Ground 11. To the extent that this aspect is raised by the Appellant in support of Ground 7, it is noteworthy that no application for adjournment was sought nor any application made to discharge the jury. This is a practical measure of the claim of prejudice now advanced by the Appellant.

295It is sufficient to state with respect to Ground 7 that no error has been demonstrated in the admission of the evidence at trial.

296I reject Ground 7.

Ground 8 - Claim that the Appellant was Unfairly Prejudiced in the Preparation of his Defence by the Decision to Admit the Identification Evidence of Mr Dasios

Submissions

297In support of this ground, the Appellant picks up the theme in Ground 7, and contends that he was prejudiced in the conduct of his defence as a result of the contents of statements made by Mr Dasios. There is a claim of unfair prejudice. 

298The Crown submits that the resolution of this ground should follow the approach adopted with respect to Ground 7.

Decision

299The subject matter of Ground 8 appears to overlap with Ground 7, in that it relates to the evidence of Mr Dasios, including the evidence of the Appellant attending the bank on the day when the sum of $650,000.00 was handed over, and the topic of the availability of the Appellant's father, Charles Miller. 

300To the extent that submissions are made in support of Ground 8 which go beyond those contained in Ground 7, it is noteworthy that no application for adjournment of the trial was made by counsel for the Appellant nor any application to discharge the jury. Claims of unfair prejudice advanced before this Court may be measured, in a practical way, by the absence of steps of this type being taken by experienced counsel who appeared for the Appellant at trial.

301I am not persuaded that leave ought be granted to the Appellant to advance Ground 8 in this Court.

302Leave to rely upon Ground 8 should be refused.

Ground 9 - Claim That Trial Counsel for the Appellant Failed to Advance All Relevant Arguments and Adduce All Evidence Provided to Him that was Exculpatory of the Appellant

303With respect to this ground of appeal, the Appellant relied upon his own affidavit sworn 6 December 2008. In light of the contents of that affidavit, a waiver of client legal privilege was obtained from the Appellant, and the Crown obtained affidavits from the Appellant's trial counsel, Peter Mitchell Paish (sworn 8 June 2012), and his instructing solicitor at the trial, Anthony Goodridge (sworn 14 June 2012). 

304The hearing of the appeal proceeded upon the basis that the parties did not require the deponents of these affidavits to give evidence before this Court (T50, 1 March 2013) with the relevant ground of appeal to be determined by reference to the affidavits and other material before this Court on the appeal.

305In support of this ground, the Appellant asserted, amongst other things, that he had provided to his legal representatives at trial a business card of Mr Tom Williams, solicitor of the firm, Williams The Law Firm. The Appellant asserted that he gave instructions to his trial counsel and solicitor with respect to this business card and its suggested relevance to issues in the trial. 

306In his affidavit, Mr Paish denies the Appellant gave him the business card either prior to the trial or at any time. Other matters were contained in the affidavit of Mr Paish responsive to the matters raised in the Appellant's affidavit. 

307It is fair to say that there was a strong denial by Mr Paish of all of the assertions by the Appellant that instructions had been given to counsel on a range of matters which were not followed through.

308The affidavit of Mr Goodridge was prepared with the assistance of his conference notes from the trial. Once again, it is fair to say that there was a strong denial of the matters asserted by the Appellant under this ground.

Submissions

309The Appellant submitted that his trial legal representatives had not complied with his instructions at trial in a manner which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

310The Crown submitted that the affidavits of Mr Paish and Mr Goodridge rebutted the Appellant's claim in this respect and that the ground ought be rejected. 

Decision

311The applicable principles where a ground of appeal against conviction relies upon the conduct of trial counsel were summarised in Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329 at [42]-[47]. The question ultimately is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice: Outram v R at [43]. 

312Even if a factual foundation had been laid for a finding that counsel had not taken a step in the trial as desired by the client, it would still be necessary to consider the nature of the step in the context of the trial given counsel's wide discretion in the conduct of the trial, and the consequences said to flow from the course taken. It is ordinarily not for an appellate court to review the decisions made by counsel at trial: Outram v R at [47].

313The Appellant bears the onus of establishing the facts upon which he seeks to rely in support of this ground of appeal. A fundamental difficulty for the Appellant is that there is a conflict in the accounts provided on this aspect by him, on the one hand, and his trial counsel and solicitor on the other hand. The contemporaneous conference notes of his trial solicitor do not support the Appellant's account.

314There is no reason why the affidavits of the Appellant's trial counsel and solicitor should not be accepted.

315An examination of the record of the trial indicates that the Appellant's counsel and solicitor represented him with appropriate vigour and thoroughness. The Appellant's legal representatives were experienced criminal law practitioners. 

316It may be inferred that, if the Appellant had provided to them what was said to be a significant item or document, they would have sought to deploy it in the Appellant's interests at trial. I do not accept the Appellant's account of events at the trial. The Appellant has not demonstrated a factual foundation in support of Ground 9. 

317I would refuse the Appellant leave to rely upon Ground 9 which, in any event, has no merit.
 

Ground 10 - Claim of Discretionary Error in Admitting Documentary Evidence Not Contained in the Crown Brief

Submissions

318The Appellant submits that certain documents relating to the $650,000.00 withdrawal were not made available to the defence before trial, with a consequence that forensic documentary examination could not be undertaken with respect to them. Reference was made to the original withdrawal slip and the Thoroughbred Registration Form.

319The Appellant noted his own evidence under cross-examination that the writing on a document seemed to be ""pictorially similar"" to his handwriting, although he denied that it was his writing (T756, AB1304).

320The Appellant submitted that had the document been made available at an earlier time, there could have been further document testing capable of being undertaken.

321The Crown submitted that no unfair prejudice had been demonstrated nor any error by the trial Judge.

322The Crown submitted, in any event, that, given the denial of the Appellant of any connection with the fraud, and his ability to contest the evidence that the $650,000.00 was withdrawn, there could be no forensic advantage to the Appellant in obtaining forensic or handwriting expert evidence of these documents.

Decision

323The matters complained of under this ground do not appear to have been the subject of complaint at trial. 

324It is appropriate to bear in mind that the Crown case that the Appellant attended the South Hurstville branch of the Commonwealth Bank on 4 February 2004 was based upon the direct evidence of three witnesses (Messrs Brett Gall, Purkiss and Dasios), as well as the substantial body of circumstantial and documentary evidence. His Honour observed (on sentence) that the Crown case that the Appellant was present at the Commonwealth Bank on the occasion when the sum of $650,000.00 was handed over was ""overwhelming"" (ROS7; AB194). As will be seen in the context of Ground 1 (the unreasonable verdicts ground), this finding was both open and correct.

325No error or miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated.

326I would refuse leave for the Appellant to rely upon Ground 10. In any event, I would reject the ground as having no merit. 

327I reject Ground 10.

Ground 11 - The Fresh Evidence Ground

328The Appellant asserted that his father, Charles Miller, was not reasonably available to give oral evidence at the trial so that his father's evidence constitutes fresh evidence.

329In support of this ground, the Appellant relied upon part of his own affidavit sworn 6 December 2008 (paragraphs 90ff) and the affidavit of Charles Harold Miller sworn 17 August 2010. 

330The Crown relied upon the affidavits of Virginia Maria Boulous sworn 3 August 2012 and 28 February 2013. 

331Once again, it was agreed that it was not necessary for the parties to cross-examine the deponents of these affidavits for the purpose of determining this ground. 

Submissions

332The Appellant submitted that this ground, which is linked to Ground 7, identified a body of fresh evidence which this Court should take into account on appeal. The submissions of the Appellant referred again to the identification evidence of Mr Dasios (Ground 7) and the evidence which the Appellant's father could have given on that issue if he had been available. 

333The Crown submits that at no time during the trial did the Appellant seek an adjournment or discharge of the jury based upon any suggestion that he wished to call his father to give evidence.

334The Crown submits, as well, that the proffered fresh evidence is neither fresh nor credible. 

Decision

335The relevant principles to be applied concerning fresh evidence appear in the extract from R v Abou-Chabake (at [132] above).

336In the course of determining Ground 7, I expressed some conclusions which are relevant to this ground as well (see [294] above).

337The Appellant contends that he was unaware until the trial that it was to be alleged (by several witnesses) that his father was also said to be present at the South Hurstville branch of the Commonwealth Bank in February 2004, on the occasion when the sum of $650,000.00 was obtained. It is said that Mr Charles Miller was overseas at the time of the trial and thus could not be called as a witness at the trial. In this way, it is said that the evidence of Charles Miller is fresh evidence.

338As previously observed, it is noteworthy that no adjournment application was made, nor any application to discharge the jury because of any suggested difficulty in calling Charles Miller to give evidence. This is a practical measure of the claim of prejudice now advanced.

339The Appellant has not demonstrated that this evidence is fresh evidence in accordance with the principles summarised in R v Abou-Chabake. 

340To the extent that there is some reliance under this fresh evidence ground (concerning the 2007 trial) upon matters relied upon by the Appellant under Ground 6 in the appeal from the 2009 trial, I repeat the conclusions expressed with respect to that ground earlier in this judgment (at [132]-[148] above). The Appellant has not demonstrated that the documents upon which he seeks to rely only came to his attention, and were available to him, as a result of a delivery by Ms Boulous of a box of documents following the completion of the Appellant's 2009 trial. The Appellant has not demonstrated that that material is credible and fresh or new.

341I reject Ground 11.

Ground 12 - Claim That the Combined and Cumulative Effect of Each of the Stated Grounds of Appeal Has Caused a Serious Miscarriage of Justice

342In circumstances where each of the Appellant's grounds of appeal considered so far have been rejected, their cumulative effect does not give rise to any other conclusion. 

343Ground 12 ought be rejected.
 
Ground 1 - Claim That the Verdicts Were Unreasonable 
Ground 13 - Claim That the Convictions Were Unsafe and Unsatisfactory

344These grounds of appeal should be considered together. The real ground of appeal is that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 

345For reasons made clear earlier in this judgment (at [34]), the use of the formula ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" is no longer appropriate. In these circumstances, Ground 13 is surplusage and no more need be said about it. The ground to be addressed is Ground 1.

Submissions

346The Appellant submitted that there was no evidence adduced by the Crown capable of identifying or establishing, to the criminal standard of proof, that he used false documentary instruments as charged. In support of this proposition, the Appellant made a number of submissions critical of the evidence of a number of Crown witnesses.

347The Appellant submitted that the evidence of a number of Crown witnesses, who were said to have related business interests and not be independent, had been discredited completely by defence counsel at trial, thereby giving rise to a reasonable hypothesis that the Appellant did not make or use false instruments or obtain money by deception as charged. 

348The Appellant submitted that the totality of the evidence lacked probative force so that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.

349The Crown submitted that there was a combination of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence before the jury which was more than sufficient to support the verdicts on each count. It was submitted that the Crown case was an overwhelming one, and that the Appellant left a trail of reliable circumstantial evidence in his wake so that, when taken in combination with the direct evidence, the verdicts of guilty were inevitable.

Decision

350The task of the Court in determining a ground of appeal such as this was summarised in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at 332-333 [31]-[34]: 

""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29]. 

33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.'

34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

351To the extent that the Crown case against the Appellant was based upon circumstantial evidence, in addition to direct evidence, it is appropriate to bear in mind the approach of this Court to appeals from jury verdicts arising from circumstantial evidence. In Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202, the Court said at [30]:

""This Court has emphasised the fact that a jury brings to consideration of a circumstantial case the common experience of members of the community who apply their collective knowledge of human affairs and their common sense: R v Kaldor [2004] NSWCCA 425; 150 A Crim R 271 at 272-273 [2], 293-294 [86]; Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 at [88]; BJR v R [2008] NSWCCA 43; 185 A Crim R 360 at 380 [97]. After citing these authorities, Giles JA (Howie and Buddin JJ agreeing) said in Burrell v R at [65]:

'This Court must make its own assessment of the evidence. But the assessment is of the cumulative effect of the evidence, and with due regard to the common experience of human affairs and common sense brought by the jury to their determination of guilt or innocence'.""

352In the present case, the jury had an opportunity to observe the Crown witnesses and the Appellant give evidence. In circumstances where challenges were made to the credibility of witnesses, including the Appellant, the jury had a considerable advantage in seeing the witnesses give evidence and their demeanour whilst doing so.

353For the purposes of resolving this ground, it is helpful to refer to the trial Judge's factual findings on sentence (AB190-193), which summarise accurately the evidence adduced at the trial.

354His Honour found that the essence of the deception alleged by the Crown was that the Appellant, pretending to be John Harris, solicitor, with the assistance of Mr Copeland, a mortgage broker, approached Mr Suman Sharma, a personal mortgage manager employed by the ANZ Bank. His Honour noted that the verdicts of the jury indicated that it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Copeland was aware that the person pretending to be John Harris was an impostor.

355Contact was made with Mr Sharma indicating that it was desired that a client, Ivan Pagett (whose daughter was said to be ill), wished to mortgage his home at Concord so that he could buy a home for his daughter. Mr Sharma received a telephone call from a person calling himself John Harris, who said he was the solicitor for Mr Pagett. Mr Sharma said that he had never met Mr Harris face to face. The whole transaction took a couple of months. 

356In support of the loan application, the documents referred to in Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the indictment were presented to the ANZ Bank. Mr Sharma accepted the documents at face value, together with the assertion of Mr Harris that he was a solicitor, then acting for Mr Pagett. The documents presented to Mr Sharma included a falsified solicitor's letterhead, a falsified passport and driver's licence in the name of Ivan Pagett, falsified details of a personal cheque account in the name of Ivan Pagett, a falsified letter of employment and a false document purporting to be a PAYG summary. The purpose of these documents was to convince the ANZ Bank that Mr Pagett was a man aged in his 50s, receiving an annual salary in excess of $100,000.00 and well able to meet the required mortgage payments.
 
357Mr Sharma conceded that he acted contrary to accepted banking practice in not meeting Mr Pagett, but stated that he spoke on the telephone to a person who said he was Mr Pagett, who said his daughter was ill and that he wanted everything done through his solicitor.

358His Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Pagett, a 78-year old man who had been disabled since 1979. His Honour noted that his evidence was in no serious way contested. He said that he had never asked anyone for a mortgage over his home. He stated that neither of his two daughters were sick in 2003. He became aware of the alleged mortgage when he received in the mail a chequebook from the ANZ Bank. 

359Mr Pagett said that he had never held a passport and he had a driver's licence only until 1978. 

360His Honour referred to evidence given by Brett Gall, and his father, Raymond Gall. Brett Gall said he had known the Appellant for over 30 years. On Boxing Day 2003, Brett Gall had met the Appellant at the races. The Appellant told Mr Gall that he was coming into some money, and that he was thinking of buying a racehorse if the Galls had one for him. At a later date, the Appellant told Mr Gall he was going to get a cheque for $200,000.00 or $300,000.00. He asked if he could deposit that cheque into the bank account of the Galls. 

361Later, Mr Gall said he discovered that about $750,000.00 had been deposited as payment for the horse, which was to cost the Appellant about $100,000.00. It was at that time that the Appellant asked if it would be possible for him to get the $650,000.00 owing to him in cash. Mr Gall said he telephoned the bank to see if that could be done and was told that it could.

362A date was arranged and, on that date in February 2004, Brett Gall, Brian Purkiss and the Appellant's father, Charles Miller, went to the Commonwealth Bank at South Hurstville. When they arrived at the bank, the Appellant was already present. Before entering the bank, papers relating to the sale of the horse were signed by the Appellant on the roof of his car.

363The four men then entered the bank and were shown to the office of Mr Dasios, the manager. The money was brought in by a teller in bundles of $10,000.00, which was counted out by Mr Dasios on a counting machine. The total sum of $650,000.00 in cash was handed by Mr Dasios to the Appellant, who was identified by Mr Dasios.

364Mr Dasios stated that the reason he remembered the Appellant was that he was the person doing all the talking. 

365His Honour noted that it was the Appellant's evidence at the trial that he was not present on this occasion, that he did not receive any part of the money, that he did not pretend to be John Harris, that he did not sign any documents relating to the Ivan Pagett loan and that he was completely uninvolved in the transaction.

366It is useful, as well, to refer to the principal circumstances relied upon by the Crown, and a more detailed account of the evidence, in support of its case against the Appellant under the headings utilised at the trial.

First Circumstance - There Was No Solicitor Called John Harris

367Jennifer Platt, an officer with the Professional Standards Department of the Law Society of NSW gave evidence that there was no person by the name of ""John Harris"" practising as a solicitor at 48 Hunter Street, Sydney from July 2003 to February 2004.

368Detective Senior Constable Hetherington also gave evidence that there was no solicitor's office on the relevant levels at 48 Hunter Street, Sydney nor a firm entitled ""J Harris Solicitors"" at any part of that building.

Second Circumstance - The Appellant Received the Proceeds of the Cheque for $759,739.58 Drawn Against the $800,000.00 Loan Granted by the ANZ Bank By Way of $650,000.00 Cash and an 80% Share in a Racehorse

369In November 2003, Brett Gall was the General Manager for Galloping Press. He gave evidence that he had known the Appellant for about 30 years and saw him about twice a year. 

370On Boxing Day 2003, Brett Gall saw the Appellant at Randwick races. In the course of that meeting, the Appellant told him that he was coming into some money and was thinking of buying a horse. The Appellant later contacted Brett Gall by phone and they discussed a price, about $100,000.00 including ongoing training costs for two-to-three years.

371The Appellant told him that he expected to get a cheque for $200,000.00 or $300,000.00 from a property settlement.

372The Appellant obtained the bank account details so that he could deposit the cheque into that account. Some time after the cheque was deposited, the Appellant asked Brett Gall, by telephone, if it would be possible to get the money to him in cash. Brett Gall called the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at South Hurstville and asked if the sum of $650,000.00 cash could be withdrawn. When he was advised that it could, a date was fixed and Brett Gall told the Appellant of the nominated date.

373On that date, Brett Gall, Charles Miller and Brian Purkiss went to the bank. The Appellant was already there when they arrived at the bank. The papers relating to the horse, ""Manor Born"", were signed by the Appellant on the roof of the car before they all went into the bank. 

374The men were taken into a back room of the bank, where the money was brought by a bank officer and the bundles were counted. Brett Gall signed for the money, and the Appellant put the money into a brown suitcase he had with him. When they returned to the cars, the Appellant threw the suitcase on to the back seat of his car before moving it to the boot. Everyone, except the Appellant, drove back to work in Brian Purkiss' car. 

375Under cross-examination, Brett Gall denied that he and Brian Purkiss took the $650,000.00 cash.

376Brett Gall said that the Appellant was still registered as an owner of the horse at the time of the trial. 

377Raymond Gall (Brett Gall's father) gave evidence that in 2003-2004 he was a director of Galloping Press. Raymond Gall said that he had known the Appellant for about 40 years. 

378The Appellant contacted Raymond Gall, asking when he would be able to put him on to a good horse. Discussion ensued and the Appellant told Raymond Gall that he had a property settlement coming up and he was interested in buying a horse.

379Several further conversations ensued, and eventually the Appellant told Raymond Gall that the property matter had been settled and that the money would be put in one of Mr Gall's accounts. The Appellant told him that there would be more money than the price of the horse and that he wanted the balance in cash. 

380The Appellant later called Raymond Gall and said that the money had been transferred. The office manager confirmed that about $759,000.00 had been paid in. The horse sold to the Appellant was one that had been earmarked for the Melbourne sales. He stated that the agreement as to ownership was that the Appellant would have 80%, whilst he and his company would have 20%. Several reports were prepared in relation to the horse and the Appellant's father, Charles Miller, was given progress reports.

381Brian Purkiss gave evidence in the Crown case. Mr Purkiss was an employee of Galloping Press and had known the Appellant for about eight or nine years.

382Mr Purkiss stated that he was asked to drive Brett Gall and Charles Miller to the bank and he was present when the Appellant signed papers on the roof of his car outside the bank in South Hurstville on 4 February 2004. Also present were Brett Gall and Charles Miller. He said that the Appellant's daughter was inside the Appellant's car. 

383After the papers were signed, all persons went into the bank. Brett Gall spoke to someone at the counter and then the manager came out and they were taken to a private room where the money was brought in. It was in bundles of $10,000.00. The Appellant placed $600,000.00 or $650,000.00 in a bag and they left the bank. When the Appellant threw the bag onto the back seat of the car, Mr Purkiss told him that it would be safer to put it in the boot. The Appellant did so and drove off.

384In 2004, Phillip Markou was employed as a teller at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at South Hurstville. He gave evidence that he was aware that a customer had ordered a large cash withdrawal of $650,000.00 on 4 February 2004.

385About midday on 4 February 2004, Mr Markou was told that the persons making that withdrawal were at the bank in the manager's office. He was given a withdrawal slip by the manager, Mr Dasios. He processed the withdrawal, counted the money, placed it into a large green canvas bag and gave it to Mr Dasios. He observed the people making the withdrawal leaving the bank and gave some descriptions of them. He thought there were a combination of men and women in the group, but he could recall in particular, an older gentlemen, pretty tall build, whitish grey hair, walking out with the brief case. Subsequently, he attended the Downing Centre Court complex to see if he could recognise any of the people he had seen on 4 February 2004, but he could not recognise anyone.

386George Dasios gave evidence that, in February 2004, he was the bank manager of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at South Hurstville when the sum of $650,000.00 was withdrawn. He described four men who attended, three being in their early 40s and the other man being in his late 70s. He also gave evidence that he subsequently saw one of the men he had described as being in his 40s, in April or May 2005, but he did not speak to him on that occasion. Mr Dasios then saw the same person about two months later when he was with his manager, Greg Ahladiotis, who spoke to the man and said, ""Damon Miller, where have you been""? The person addressed as ""Damon Miller"" responded to Mr Ahladiotis, and the meeting between the three of them lasted about two minutes. Mr Dasios recognised that person coming out of the lifts in the court complex and entering the court room, the only difference being that the man had lost a lot of weight since then, but it was the same man (identified as the Appellant).

Third Circumstance - The Appellant provided the same mobile number that John Harris provided as his contact number, as a contact mobile number for himself

Fourth Circumstance - Callers traceable to the Appellant had been contacting the mobile phone number nominated by the person John Harris

387John Burraston was a postman with Australia Post from September 2000 to May 2004, and a member of the Earlwood Bardwell Park RSL from 2003 to 2004. He gave evidence that he knew the Appellant from about mid-2002 to 2004. He frequently saw the Appellant at the RSL. They exchanged telephone numbers. Mr Burraston gave evidence of the contact telephone numbers he had for the Appellant.

388The Appellant's daughter, Noelle, contacted Mr Burraston on the mobile phone using the number said to be that of John Harris on 31 December 2003, a day after the phone was activated, and again on 8 and 9 January 2004. 

Fifth Circumstance - Some Time in 2003 the Appellant Introduced Himself to Leonard Whitaker and Exhibited an Interest in Meeting with Mr Ivan Pagett About the Preparation of a Will

Sixth Circumstances - Mr Whitaker Provided the Appellant with Mr Pagett's Residential Address at Links Avenue, Concord

389Leonard Whitaker was a tourist bus driver in 2003. He gave evidence that he met Ivan Pagett about two or three years earlier, and would see Mr Pagett about three or four times a week and take him out according to Mr Pagett's itinerary. Mr Whitaker left his dog with Mr Pagett for eight months whilst Mr Whitaker went to Thailand. 

390Around the time that he knew Mr Pagett, Mr Whitaker was a member of the Earlwood Bardwell Park RSL, where he came to know David Miller. The Appellant had introduced himself as David Miller, not Damon Miller. Mr Whitaker used to drive the Appellant and his associates to the races. Mr Whitaker did not have the Appellant's telephone number, but the Appellant had Mr Whitaker's number and would ring him when he needed his services.

391Mr Whitaker said that he had told the Appellant about his other customers and that he admired Mr Pagett and his independence. The Appellant asked Mr Whitaker, ""Has he got a will""? Mr Whitaker replied, ""I don't know, why don't you approach him""? He then gave the Appellant Mr Pagett's address at Links Avenue, Concord.

392Ivan Karl Pagett (born in 1929) had lived at his home in Links Avenue, Concord for 45 years. He thought that the mortgage on the house had probably been paid off in 1969. The house was in his wife's name only and, when she died, he discovered a $20,000.00 mortgage which he paid off in 1992. Since that time, he had never sought to again mortgage the house. 

393Mr Pagett had been a plumber during his working life. When he received a cheque book from the ANZ Bank in 2003 or 2004, he threw it away. 

394Mr Pagett had never spoken to anyone at LJ Hooker Burwood about buying a house for his daughter, and he did not know anyone known as John Harris.

395Peter Hernfield gave evidence that he was a real estate agent employed by LJ Hooker Burwood. In October 2003, he received a telephone call at his office from a man calling himself Ivan Pagett. That person sounded as if he was in his 50s. He said that he was buying a home for his daughter and that his solicitor was John Harris of Hunter Street, Sydney with a telephone number being provided. 

396An arrangement was made for Mr Pagett to attend the property for an inspection on 7 October 2003, but no one turned up at the appointed time. When he returned to the office, he contacted the number given to him and a voice message stated that he had contacted ""Ivan Pagett"", but the voice sounded different to the person to whom he had previously spoken. Mr Hernfield left a message but the person did not contact him. 

397Mr Pagett's daughter, Narelle Brien, gave evidence that she knew a solicitor named John Carmody, both professionally and socially, though he had not acted as her solicitor since about 1995. Between 1992 and 1995, she had occasion to access her father's Certificate of Title for the property at Links Avenue, Concord. Her father had asked her to get that document from Mr Carmody's office because he wanted to help his other daughter out and act as a guarantor for her. She obtained the Certificate of Title for her father and, when it was not needed, she thought that it had been returned to Mr Carmody's office.

398In cross-examination, Ms Brien said that she and her brothers were a little concerned about the friendship that had been formed between her father and Mr Whitaker, and the fact that Mr Whitaker was at the house. She agreed that the reason her father required the Certificate of Title was so that he act as surety for her younger sister's bail. 

399John Carmody gave evidence that he was a solicitor in practice since 1980 at Burwood, with the Pagett family as a client. In 1993, he handled the estate of the late Joan Pagett and arranged for the property at Links Avenue, Concord to be transferred to her husband. At that time, he took possession of the original Certificate of Title showing Ivan Pagett as the sole proprietor. The Certificate of Title had been in his office since then, except for a period from 4 October 1995 to 8 November 1996 when Mr Pagett's daughter, Narelle, took it away.

400About November 2004, Mr Carmody became away of a fraudulent transaction concerning the property at Links Avenue, Concord. Mr Carmody did a title search and discovered that an application had been made for a replacement Certificate of Title. Mr Carmody then contacted the ANZ Bank on behalf of Mr Pagett, and informed the bank that his client had not entered into that transaction, and that he expected the bank to cause the mortgage registered by the bank over the title to be discharged and removed from the title. 

401Gregory Channell gave evidence that he was a solicitor employed as a Legal Officer by the Department of Lands (Office of the Registrar General of NSW). In October 2004, he was contacted by Detective Senior Constable Hetherington in relation to the alleged fraudulent transaction in connection with Mr Pagett's property at Links Avenue, Concord. A Land & Property Information search was conducted. It was found that the fraudulent Certificate of Title had the words ""Local Government Area of Concord"", whereas the real Certificate of Title bore the words ""Municipality of Concord"". 

402Mr Carmody wrote to Mr Channell on 9 November 2004 on behalf of Mr Pagett, enclosing a copy of a title search they had done, a Change of Name document which had been obtained and other documents. 

Seventh Circumstance - The Appellant Met the Valuer When he Visited Mr Pagett's Property at Links Avenue, Concord to Make his Assessment for the ANZ Bank

Eighth Circumstance - The Appellant Required Access to Mr Pagett's Home to Access Information Relevant to the Pretend Loan Application and to Meet the Valuer

403Mark Chung gave evidence that, in 2003, he was a property valuer. He conducted a valuation of the property at Links Avenue, Concord on 28 October 2003 for the ANZ Bank. He saw two persons at the premises. He met a person outside the house and said, ""So you are a solicitor. Can I have one of your business cards""? The man said, ""I don't have one on me"". He described the man as being in his late 40s or early 50s with other features also described.

404Mr Chung entered the house, the door was open and part of the time the man was inside the house and, at other times, he was outside. Towards the end of the valuation, another person arrived in a taxi. That person was not disabled and was also in his late 40s or early 50s. Mr Chung thanked the person he had first seen at the premises and left the property. He prepared a valuation report with the property being reasonably worth $1 million, and he sent the report to the ANZ Bank.

405In cross-examination, Mr Chung said that the first person he described had unlocked the house with a set of keys.

406The evidence of Mr Whitaker and Ms Brien (at [389]-[398] above) was also relevant to these circumstances.

Ninth Circumstance - The Accountant Nominated in the False Tax Returns Tendered in Support of Mr Pagett's Alleged Income was Peter Hill, the Same Name Stated as an Accountant for the Appellant in a Document Found in the Appellant's Briefcase Upon Arrest 

Tenth Circumstance - The Tax Agent Number Quoted in the False Tax Documents Was Used by a Tax Agent With Whom the Appellant Had Been Associated

407An Accountant, Robert Elliot, gave evidence that from 2000-2005 he ran a taxation services business at Bardwell Park. He met the Appellant at Christmas 2002, being introduced to him as David Miller. 

408Mr Elliot was shown the false tax returns used in support of Mr Pagett's alleged income. He said that Peter Hill was not a tax agent with whom he was familiar, but the tax agent number belonged to Mr Tony Taktak, a person to whom Mr Elliot was trying to sell his business and for whom he was preparing tax returns. 

409There was clear opportunity for the Appellant to obtain the tax agent number utilised on the false document through his association with Mr Elliot. 
 
Eleventh Circumstance - The Phone Number Provided as a Landline for Drain Savers (the Company Falsely Presented in the Loan Documentation as Mr Pagett's Employer)_Was a Telephone Number Allocated to a Billing Address at Bardwell Park Connected with the Appellant

410The Appellant conceded that whoever fabricated the Drain Savers documents, used in support of the false application, included a telephone number associated with an address at Bardwell Park. There was evidence associating the Appellant with this address in a manner that permitted a finding that the Appellant had knowledge of, and an ability to use, that telephone number in any false document. 

The Appellant's Case

411The Appellant gave evidence that he knew nothing of the matters alleged by the Crown. He denied having any knowledge of, or involvement in, an application to the ANZ Bank purportedly on behalf of Ivan Pagett, said to be a 54-year old plumber earning $122,000.00 a year, secured by a mortgage over the Links Avenue, Concord property.

412The Appellant denied using the name John Harris or pretending to be a solicitor named John Harris.

413The Appellant admitted that he knew Leonard Whitaker and John Burraston, but denied any association with those persons in the manner relied upon by the Crown.

414The Appellant was cross-examined to some effect upon the range of his associations and access to premises and phone numbers, which came to be mentioned (in one respect or another) in false documentation relied upon in support of the loan application. The Appellant denied that he was involved in the activities in question completely. 
 
Decision

415The Crown case against the Appellant comprised several powerful and overlapping elements:

(a) direct evidence from Brian Purkiss, Brett Gall and George Dasios of the Appellant's attendance at the Commonwealth Bank on 4 February 2004 to obtain the sum of $650,000.00 in cash as a result of the deception of the ANZ Bank;

(b) direct evidence from other persons who knew the Appellant, including John Burraston, Leonard Whitaker and Robert Elliot, which linked the Appellant to critical persons and events associated with the offences;

(c) a range of fabricated documents used to deceive the ANZ Bank in support of the loan application, with features of those documents bearing tell tale links to the Appellant.

416This was a powerful Crown case demonstrating that the Appellant was the person calling himself John Harris, solicitor, who had orchestrated the false loan application utilising Mr Pagett's property.

417Having considered the record of the trial, in accordance with the principles referred to at [350] above, I am well satisfied that it was open to the jury to find the Appellant guilty on each of the counts charged against him. 

418The jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the Appellant give evidence, together with other witnesses at the trial. That advantage would, in my view, have reinforced a conclusion that the Appellant was not a truthful witness, but rather a calculated fraudster who had devised the criminal scheme reflected in the charges of which he was convicted.

419I express my own satisfaction that the guilt of the Appellant of each offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt.

420I would reject Ground 1.

Conclusion concerning Conviction Appeal

421I have considered and rejected all grounds of appeal relating to conviction. 

422A perusal of the summing up indicates that all necessary and appropriate directions were given to the jury by the trial Judge. In the result, a properly directed jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the Appellant on each of the counts brought against him. No basis has been demonstrated for this Court to disturb the verdicts of the jury. 

423No ground of appeal sought to rely upon a contrast between the Appellant's conviction and Mr Copeland's acquittal on all counts. This is entirely understandable as the Crown case against Mr Copeland was markedly different from (and very much weaker than) the powerful Crown case against the Appellant.

Application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentences Imposed Following the 2007 Trial

424The Appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal with respect to sentence:

(a) Ground 14 - The sentence is manifestly excessive.

(b) Ground 15 - The sentencing Judge, in finding that special circumstances were applicable to the Appellant with respect to the sentence to be imposed, erred in his discretion relating to an appropriate discount on sentence.

(c) Ground 16 - The sentencing Judge, in finding that special circumstances were applicable to the Appellant with respect to the sentence to be imposed, erred in the exercise of his discretion or was otherwise unfair in the exercise of his discretion, in imposing the custodial sentence that was part cumulative in respect of the four charges under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900.

(d) Ground 17 - The sentencing Judge erred in not imposing concurrent sentences for the four charges under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900, which were implicitly one collective part of the alleged criminal enterprise.

425It will be apparent that the sentences imposed by Armitage ADCJ on 14 September 2007 had expired by the time the appeal was heard in this Court. This circumstance would often be a reason why this Court would not grant leave to an appellant to advance grounds of appeal challenging a concluded sentence. 

426However, the sentences imposed by Armitage ADCJ were in force at the time when Knox DCJ sentenced the Appellant in 2009, with a measure of accumulation being reflected in the sentences. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to address the Appellant's sentence grounds. 

Findings of the Sentencing Judge

427The sentencing Judge found that the offences committed by the Appellant were of a very serious nature. As a result of the enterprise, the Appellant had benefited to the extent of the sum of $650,000.00 handed to him by Mr Dasios and, in addition, he became entitled to a an 80% share in a racehorse, leading to a total benefit in the sum of some $759,000.00.

428The sentencing Judge found that circumstances of aggravation, for the purpose of s.21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, included the substantial loss occasioned to the ANZ Bank and the fact that the offences were very well planned and prepared. His Honour observed that the false Certificate of Title was so well executed that it deceived, for a time, Mr Channell, the solicitor in the office of the Registrar General.

429His Honour found the only mitigating factor to be that the Appellant did not have a record of previous convictions. The sentencing Judge was unable to make positive findings that the Appellant was unlikely to reoffend or that his prospects of rehabilitation were good.

430The sentencing Judge considered the competing submissions concerning concurrency and accumulation, and accepted the Crown submission that the seriousness of the Appellant's conduct, in the acquisition and use of the false instruments referred to in the charges, required the imposition of partially cumulative sentences.

431His Honour found special circumstances in view of the Appellant's age and the absence of any prior criminal history.

Consideration of Sentencing Grounds 

432The grounds of appeal may be addressed together. The complaints contained in the grounds may be distilled in to the following three propositions:

(a) the sentences for all offences should have been ordered to be wholly concurrent (Grounds 16 and 17);

(b) although the sentencing Judge made a finding of ""special circumstances"", the non-parole period as a proportion of the total head sentence, is too high (Ground 15);

(c) the overall sentence is manifestly excessive (Ground 14).

433The sentencing Judge found special circumstances, by reference to the Appellant's age (47 years at the time of the offences and 50 years at the time of sentence) and his lack of criminal antecedents. The non-parole period on each count was 50% of the full term. As a proportion of the total term, his Honour fixed an effective non-parole that was 60% of the head sentence. I accept the Crown submission that this approach was generous. I would reject Ground 15.

434The sentences imposed for the four offences under s.300(2) Crimes Act 1900 were entirely concurrent. No legitimate complaint can be made by the Appellant concerning that approach.

435To the extent that Grounds 16 and 17 contend there was error in accumulating partially the sentence for Count 1 (by a period of one year), this approach was open to the sentencing Judge, in the exercise of discretion, applying the principles in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at 47-48 [27]-[28] and the totality principle. I would reject Grounds 16 and 17. 

436The claim of manifest excess must be considered with close attention being paid to the objective gravity of the Appellant's crimes. The offences were serious and well planned and were committed over an extended period of time. The forgeries used by the Appellant were professional and convincing. The commission of the offences involved the Appellant pretending to be a solicitor. A substantial monetary gain was obtained by the Appellant and the sum is unrecovered.

437I accept the Crown submission that the Appellant's moral culpability is high. He has demonstrated no remorse. Both specific and general deterrence remain significant factors on sentence.

438The sentences were well open to his Honour in the exercise of sentencing discretion. The Appellant has not demonstrated that the sentences imposed upon him were unreasonable or plainly unjust so as to make good a claim of manifest excess. 

439I reject Ground 14.

Conclusion

440The Appellant's appeals with respect to the 2007 and 2009 trials have been considered separately in this judgment. 

441The Appellant has failed to make good any of his grounds of appeal with respect to conviction and sentence at the 2009 trial. 

442The Appellant has also failed to make good any of his grounds of appeal against conviction and sentence at the 2007 trial. 

443I propose the following orders:

(a) With respect to the conviction and sentence of the Appellant following a trial before Armitage ADCJ in 2007:

(i) appeal against conviction dismissed;

(ii) leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed.

(b) With respect to the conviction and sentence of the Appellant following a trial before Knox DCJ in 2009:

(i) appeal against conviction dismissed;

(ii) leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed.

444HARRISON J: I agree with Johnson J.

445ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Johnson J. I agree with the orders proposed and with his Honour's reasons. As to grounds 1 and 13 of the appeal against conviction following the trial in 2007 before Armitage ADCJ, I have reviewed the whole of the evidence and considered the respects in which there was competing evidence. I agree for the reasons given by Johnson J that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of all the counts on the indictment.

		21 March 2014",2014-03-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763534,Michael Bar-Mordecai v The State of New South Wales [2014] NSWDC 84,"Judgment


	
	The plaintiff sues the State of New South Wales which is vicariously liable for any torts that may have been committed by a police officer. His claim is that on 12 July he attended the Waverley Police Station and that there in the reception area Senior Constable Chris Vallis assaulted and battered him.
	
	
	Assault is a tort that consists in intentionally creating in another person an apprehension of imminent, harmful or offensive contact. If the threat is actually carried out and the other person is struck in some way, that can be described correctly as an assault and a battery. On occasions a battery is committed without the person who is battered being aware that the assailant is about to assault him. However, in this case the claim of the plaintiff is that Senior Constable Vallis by his conduct and words, put him in fear of being imminently harmed and then followed that up by battering him. The battering, according to the plaintiff, was the deliberate pushing of two plastic folders containing documents into the plaintiff’s midriff area, and I am not being anatomically correct when I put it in that fashion, but that is roughly what he was talking about.
	
	
	The plaintiff gave evidence and ran his own case. From what I can understand he is an experienced litigant. Indeed the Supreme Court of New South Wales has to be moved before he can commence litigation in any court because he has been declared to be a vexatious litigant. This was mentioned a number of times in the hearing and particularly by him.
	
	
	During the course of the hearing when giving evidence himself he rather curiously referred to himself in the third person as “the plaintiff” rather than saying “I did this” or “I did that” or “Did you see me do this or that”. He said “The plaintiff did this, the plaintiff did that” or “Did you see this happen to the plaintiff, did you see the plaintiff do this, that or the other”. It was an unusual way of conducting things essentially when standing at the bar table treating himself as if he were separate from himself.
	
	
	He seeks general damages, exemplary damages and aggravated general damages. No medical evidence was given to show any specific injury and I have seen nothing to suggest any bruising or anything of that nature.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim was that he went into the police station on that day at about 5.30pm and he had with him a number of documents, one of which was an application to vary or revoke an apprehended violence order; and the other was a police report form. These exhibits were marked and tendered. They were tendered and received by me not because I was concerned with the substance of what they allege, but because it is said they were documents that were taken into the police station on the night concerned. One was an application to vary an apprehended violence order and the other was what was called a fraud report form.
	
	
	The plaintiff said that he went into the police station and his intention was to leave two folders with the desk clerk or with an officer there and to get some information about filing an application for fraud against a police officer, Senior Constable Tom Sands.
	
	
	He said that first of all Probationary Constable Burke attended him and he asked Probationary Constable Burke to place a folder that he gave him in Senior Constable Sands’ pigeonhole. He produced to the court an empty white folder to indicate the type of folder that he had asked be placed in Senior Constable Sands’ pigeonhole. The contents of the folder were not relevant. The fact was that he had asked that that folder be placed, or a folder of that type be placed in a pigeonhole. He then observed Probationary Constable Burke put this folder with some difficulty in a pigeonhole and it had to be placed on a slope in order to fit. There was then another folder left on the counter. When Probationary Constable Burke came back he asked Probationary Constable Burke to review the second folder with regard to Senior Constable Sands. Exhibit B he said were the two documents being what he described as a fraudulent form signed by Constable Sands, and then an application to vary a domestic violence order.
	
	
	He then claimed that Senior Constable Vallis approached and became enraged with this. That is his face became angry with contorted facial features; he flushed and started shouting with words to the following effect, “This is an AVO, it has nothing to do with the police. Police officers don’t commit fraud. Get out of here and take these things with you and get out of here”, and he said Senior Constable Vallis was standing opposite him and commenced to scream in a belligerent overbearing and aggressive and loudmouthed in a confrontational manner and that he could not deal with things impartial and stayed attached. This caused him, the plaintiff, to feel embarrassed, intimidated, anxious, fearful, harassed and scared for his wellbeing.
	
	
	He claimed that Senior Constable Vallis was 110 centimetres from him when he felt this fear. He said the counter was eight-one centimetres and he had in fact earlier tendered a diagram which indicated that he had been to the police station - this is exhibit A - and had measured the width and length of the reception counter, the length being 179 centimetres and the width eighty-one centimetres. He made measurements about other matters in the police station and they were included in the diagram.
	
	
	He saw another four officers enter and stay in the reception area but no one said anything to him. He then observed Probationary Constable Burke go over to Senior Constable Sands’ pigeonhole, collect the white folder and hand it to Constable Vallis who accepted it with his left hand. Probationary Constable Burke then approached Senior Constable Vallis and said “I have another folder here from this gentleman for Constable Sands”. Senior Constable Vallis he said with his left hand took the first folder from Probationary Constable Burke and the second folder from the reception counter, bundled them together and proceeded to batter the plaintiff’s anterior abdominal wall with the two folders simultaneously and he aggregated the two folders together he said, and he started pushing it against him and he said, “Get out of the police station or I’ll throw you bodily” or “bodily throw you out”. He then said to Constable Vallis, “You just assaulted me with two folders”. He then said that as a result of all this he felt harassed and unsafe, took the two folders, left the Waverley Police Station in an agitated and tremulous state, and was agitated for the next three days and unable to study medicine. He said he did not raise his hand to Senior Constable Vallis prior to or following his assault and that in substance was the claim of assault.
	
	
	The assault is said to be the shouting and yelling and threatening and saying he would throw him out of the police station, and the battery is said to be pushing the two folders together against the plaintiff’s anterior abdominal wall while uttering these threats to injure him. That is the substance of the case. No medical evidence was called. As I have said no photographs of any injuries were produced and substantially the claim is that he was psychologically affected, I suppose in a broad sense, for a number of days.
	
	
	The plaintiff is a man who was on the roll of medical practitioners and was removed from the roll of medical practitioners and is anxious to get back to the roll of medical practitioners, hence he said he was studying medicine.
	
	
	In the statement of claim the plaintiff refers to the fact that the violation was captured by an operational CCTV camera. However in this court he has said, he having looked at the CCTV footage, that someone has tampered with it and it does not really reflect what happened. I have examined the CCTV footage, which is exhibit 1. There are, in fact, two separate films on the disc, both taken of the same area in the police station but from different angles.
	
	
	It is observable to me that at the top left hand side of both of these films there was a time bar which measures by the time of the day it was taken, the hour, minutes and the seconds. I have looked at these two films. I looked at one of them in court. I looked at two of them in my chambers. I have looked at them a number of times because of this controversy as to whether they could have been tampered with and because counsel for the defendant pointed to the presence of the time bar at the top left hand corner, and I have concluded there is no evidence whatsoever of tampering. Each second of someone who is in the sight of the particular camera, and there are obviously two cameras placed in different places, is counted. There are no jumps, there are no gaps, there are no unexplained pauses in the film and then the film starting up again. Everything runs perfectly seamlessly second by second.
	
	
	The film itself, without going to the evidence of Senior Constable Vallis, refutes the entire case put by the plaintiff. Senior Constable Vallis denied in evidence shouting or screaming at the plaintiff. The CCTV footage certainly has no sound but looking at his face on the CCTV footage, on the camera vision that shows him full on, he does not appear to be contorting his face in any way whatsoever, nor does his body show any degree of agitation.
	
	
	The plaintiff claimed in evidence that he stood 10 centimetres back from this counter, that Senior Constable Vallis was 10 centimetres back on the other side. The significance of that was, particularly, in part of the defence, where, it was said, that Senior Constable Vallis pushed the plaintiff's hand away from his face by way of self-defence when the plaintiff raised his hand towards his face in a threatening manner. Mr Bar-Mordecai said, because of the distance he was standing back from the table, and because the distance Senior Constable Vallis was standing back, there is no possible way that his hand could have come anywhere near the hand, or the face or body, of Senior Constable Vallis. Therefore Senior Constable Vallis' claim was completely untrue. He also put, in cross‑examination of Senior Constable Vallis, if he raised his hand it would have been his right hand because he was a right handed person. Senior Constable Vallis said what he saw was a left hand being raised towards his face and he instinctively put his arm up to ward it off. Whether he touched it, he doesn't know.
	
	
	I have looked at the CCTV footage and, in my opinion, it is absolutely clear that the plaintiff, at the times he was talking to Senior Constable Vallis, was leaning over this bench, or table, with his body, and it is clear to me that at one point shortly before he left the police station he raised his left hand in a sharp upwards movement and Senior Constable Vallis put what appeared to be his right hand up close to that. It is clear to me it was the left hand that was raised, not the right hand, and it is clear to me that the plaintiff was well over the table and close enough to touch Senior Constable Vallis. I do not accept that at any relevant time in that incident that he was ten centimetres away from the table.
	
	
	As to the assault alleged, everything happened in a short space of time. At 5:34:36 Probationary Constable Burke took a folder away from the counter, towards the pigeonholes and put the folder in a pigeonhole. At 5:35:40 he can be seen with the plaintiff, examining the apparent contents of a second folder. The plaintiff can be seen leaning over the counter and pointing to features of this folder. Probationary Constable Burke can also be seen getting some other bunch of papers, bringing them over and turning them with his hand. Whether they were police instructions of some kind, I don't know, but they were separate altogether from what was in the folder shown by Mr Bar‑Mordecai. There appeared to be discussions between the two of them.
	
	
	Then, at 5:36:51, Mr Bar‑Mordecai is shown leaning over the counter and pointing to someone behind the counter. That someone appears to be Senior Constable Vallis. Before Senior Constable Vallis comes onto the scene, there is another police officer shown, standing beside Probationary Constable Burke to his right, doing something apparently unconnected with this. He doesn't raise his eyes in any way towards Mr Bar‑Mordecai. He takes no interest in anything that is going on there. To the extent that he raises his head, he is turning towards a door to his right, through which eventually Senior Constable Vallis comes.
	
	
	Senior Constable Vallis actually turned up at 5:36:30 and Mr Bar‑Mordecai left a little after 5:38. So the actual discussions between them took place in less than three minutes. Not five minutes, as Mr Bar‑Mordecai seemed to think.
	
	
	What is shown from the film is Probationary Constable Burke going away to the area where the pigeonhole boxes are, bringing back a folder, putting it on the counter. The other folder is still on the counter. Then Mr Bar‑Mordecai is shown getting the two folders together. Then he is shown raising his hand. Just before that Senior Constable Vallis is pointing out towards the doorway. Then Mr Bar‑Mordecai raises his hand and Senior Constable Vallis raises his hand. Mr Bar‑Mordecai's hand was his left hand. Senior Constable Vallis raises his right hand, close to where Mr Bar‑Mordecai's hand is thrust across the table. Then Mr Bar‑Mordecai gets the folders and walks out, and as he walks out he turns around. Now, it may be that he said further words, but it is clear to me that at no point was he struck with the folders and, indeed, he grabbed the folders and walked out. His claims that somebody doctored the tapes do not make any sense. They are contradicted by what is shown on the tapes. The way he gets them into possession is he gets them into possession using his own hands and walks out.
	
	
	Senior Constable Vallis, apart from the video, denied any assault and substantially gave an account that is consistent enough with the CCTV footage to be able to say it is obviously correct.
	
	
	Probationary Constable Burke gave evidence. He could not remember all of it, but he was able to say that he witnessed no assault, no thrusting into the body of Mr Bar‑Mordecai of any folders. The film also, I might add, shows Probationary Constable Burke coming and placing the folders back on the table, not putting them into the left hand of Senior Constable Vallis. Probationary Constable Burke did not thrust folders into the hands of Senior Constable Vallis. He merely put them on the table. In no sense did Senior Constable Vallis aggregate the files, to use the rather curious word the plaintiff used. He may have touched the folders a little, but he was not putting them together. In fact, as I have said before, Mr Bar‑Mordecai put them together himself and took them out.
	
	
	There was clearly no assault at any point. There was no battery, the expression used by the plaintiff. Was there an assault? That is, did Senior Constable Vallis, by his words and conduct, so threaten Mr Bar‑Mordecai that he felt an apprehension that he might be struck? He has said he did not, Constable Burke has said he did not. I accept their evidence as truthful evidence. The CCTV footage also shows that he did not do this. There is no instance in which he is shown to be pushing his body towards the plaintiff.
	
	
	His pointing to the door was in a direction away from the plaintiff. His body language does not exhibit any signs of somebody enraged and he did not appear to me to move from where he was standing behind the counter. The only time he moved was to move his body backwards slightly when Mr Bar‑Mordecai’s left hand came towards his face. He moved back slightly and moved his right hand forward to ward off this apparent blow.
	
	
	The only person who appeared to be agitated in the film was
	
	
	Mr Bar‑Mordecai. I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has brought a case which is based on no fact whatsoever, he has no doubt caused a lot of distress to Senior Constable Vallis and no doubt caused a lot of upset generally by making these allegations. They are baseless and I intend to direct that a copy of my judgment be sent to the Commissioner of Police so that he can see that in my opinion as a judge there is no cause whatsoever for thinking that Senior Constable Vallis was involved in any way in threatening behaviour.
	
	
	So I dismiss the action. I enter a verdict for the defendant.
	
	
	BATEMAN: Your Honour, on the question of costs, an offer of compromise was sent to the plaintiff on Friday 21 March offering to settle the matter for a verdict for the defendant, each party to pay their own costs. Could I hand this up to your Honour? The significance of it is that by Friday the plaintiff had had plenty of time to view the CCTV footage, the DVD had been sent to him and the defence case was well known at that stage. If that is accepted as an offer of compromise then I would ask that the plaintiff be ordered to pay costs on the normal solicitor/client basis up until Friday, but as from yesterday and today, yesterday being the morning after the service of the offer of compromise, the work day morning after, the indemnity costs. The practical effect of it is another matter, of course, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Well, I have considered these sorts of so called offers before. I’m not, of course, criticising you, Mr Bateman, I’m not suggesting you run around making these offers, but I have in other litigation had to consider costs applications made where similar offers were made, a verdict for the defendant, no order as to the costs, and it was said an order for an indemnity cost should follow. I don’t agree. I see no reason to change the ordinary order for costs.
	
	
	BATEMAN: Yes, I’m aware of other decisions, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: So all I will do is order the defendant to pay the costs. The plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant on the ordinary basis. The costs should be as agreed or as assessed.

		01 June 2015",2014-03-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763536,R v Joshua Mitchell; R v Michael Mitchell [2014] NSWCCA 33,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with the judgment of RS Hulme AJ and also the additional remarks of Garling J. 

2I thus agree that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate but that the Court should exercise its residual discretion (see Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 at [24]; Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [26], [44] and [131]; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at [85] - [95]) to dismiss the Crown appeals. In light of the imminence of the dates for the respondents' release on parole and the effect that extensions of their sentences may well have upon the continuation of their significant progress towards reform and rehabilitation, the community's interests favour dismissal of the appeals. These are factors that are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss the appeals (Green v The Queen at [43] and [131]).

3GARLING J: I agree that for the reasons which he gives, the orders proposed by RS Hulme AJ should be made.

4There can be no doubt that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. On any view they were, having careful regard to the nature of each offence, the circumstances involved in the offending and other relevant matters, insufficiently accumulated, and ultimately overly lenient.

5However, these are exceptional cases for the reasons described by R S Hulme AJ, and hence appropriate for the exercise by the Court of its residual discretion to dismiss the appeal. 

6RS HULME AJ: These reasons arise out of appeals by the Crown in respect of sentences imposed by Armitage DCJ on 16 August 2013.

7On 29 September 2009 Joshua Mitchell arranged the robbery by Michael Mitchell, Damian Spiteri and a fourth person of a Mr Salt, a 25 year old mildly intellectually disabled man with whom he, Joshua, and his girlfriend were living. Joshua Mitchell accompanied the victim to an ATM where the victim withdrew some $700 in cash. As the two were walking home the other offenders approached them. Michael Mitchell caused Mr Salt to fall to the ground and then stomped on him, although apparently without causing injury.

8Joshua Mitchell received some of the proceeds and later was heard to boast of having orchestrated the robbery.

9On 17 April 2010 Joshua Mitchell placed an order on a food store for the delivery of food as a ruse to rob whoever delivered the order. A Mr Kett, aged 72 did so. At the nominated address the resident advised Mr Kett that no order from that address had been made. As Mr Kett replaced the food on the front seat of the vehicle, he felt a push in his back forcing him to fall into the car on top of the food. The food was removed by an offender. A second offender climbed into the car, demanded Mr Kett's wallet and then, unsuccessfully, attempted to remove it. 

10Mr Kett punched that offender in the face, the co-offender reciprocated by kicking Mr Kett in the face causing the latter to fall backward and become dazed. His bumbag containing about $25 and his phone were stolen. Mr Kett suffered pain and bruising to his face and head and one of his hands.

11On 20 April 2010 Joshua Mitchell placed an order with another restaurant that delivered food, nominating delivery at nearby premises. Joshua and Michael Mitchell and a David Beale went to those nominated premises. Joshua Mitchell observed that ""they were going to roll the delivery man"" because they had no money and there was discussion about the use of a cricket bat. Joshua Mitchell carried the cricket bat to the scene of the offence. As the delivery driver, a Mr Fang, attempted to deliver the food he was struck from behind more than three times with the cricket bat and rendered unconscious. There was at least one blow to each of the head, arm and back.

12The delivery bag containing the food, the victim's wallet and $300 were stolen. The offenders were heard bragging, laughing and joking about what happened. His Honour was not satisfied that it was Joshua who struck the blows with the cricket bat but held that all participants were criminally liable for those actions.

13Mr Fang suffered extensive bruising over his back, his head, his torso and arms and legs together with a subdural haematoma and an injured spleen. He had multiple lacerations to his head, abdomen and limbs and lost several teeth. He spent a week in hospital and had to use a wheelchair for two months. Armitage DCJ described the attack on Mr Fang as ""savage, disgusting and cowardly and should not have occurred in any civilised society"". A Victim Impact Statement Mr Fang provided recorded that in consequence of the incident he had become fearful of doing, and had given up, evening delivery jobs. He has also become appreciably more antisocial. 

14Both Joshua and Michael pleaded not guilty to involvement in this offence but were convicted after a trial.

15On 26 June 2012 Michael Mitchell invited Joshua Mitchell and a Christopher Matycz to participate in a break and enter. The three offenders walked to an intended target home owned by a Mr. Truong. Two other persons, McFadden and Myer parked a vehicle nearby. Michael Mitchell broke into and entered the premises and then opened the back door and Joshua and Christopher Matycz entered. 

16Shortly thereafter the homeowner arrived and seeing signs of the offence ran towards the front door. As he arrived, the three offenders ran out carrying a number of items. Joshua threw a laptop computer at Mr. Truong and Michael Mitchell punched him in the forehead.

17The aggravating feature relied on by the Crown in connection with this offence was being in company - one that his Honour accepted was the least serious of those listed in s 105A of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour described the planning for this offence as limited.

18Police happened to be travelling along the street and saw argument between the victim and the offenders. They pursued the offenders and later Michael Mitchell and McFadden were arrested. Joshua contacted McFadden while the latter was in police custody and agreed to return to the premises to speak to police. In a police interview Joshua said that while he knew the others had entered the premises he denied participating in the offence.

19The charges against Joshua arising out of the above events, the Crimes Act provisions against which he offended and the maximum penalties for which he was liable, his pleas, and the discounts awarded for those pleas are as follows:

29 September 2009 offence - robbery in company - s 97(1) - 20 years - guilty - 25%

17 April 2010 offence - aggravated robbery in company - s 95(1) - 20 years - guilty - 12.5%

20 April 2010 offence - aggravated robbery - s 95(1) - 20 years - not guilty - nil

26 June 2012 offence (see also s 105A) - aggravated break enter and steal - s 112(2) - 20 years - guilty - 25%

20In respect of this last mentioned offence a standard non-parole period of 5 years has been prescribed.

21The sentences imposed by his Honour on Joshua Mitchell were:

29 September 2009 offence (that involving Mr Salt) - imprisonment for three years including a non parole period of 18 months, both such terms commencing on 7 June 2013;

20 April 2010 offence (that involving Mr Fang) - imprisonment for four years including a non parole period of 12 months, both such terms commencing on 7 June 2014;

17 April 2010 offence (that involving Mr Kett) - imprisonment for three years including a non parole period of 18 months, both such terms commencing on 7 December 2013;

26 June 2012 offence (that involving Mr Truong) - imprisonment for two years including a non-parole period of 12 months, both such terms commencing on 7 June 2012;

22The effective sentence was thus of imprisonment for 6 years including a non parole period of 3 years, both such terms commencing on 7 June 2012. That date was agreed between the advocates who appeared as appropriate, having regard to Joshua's pre-sentence custody. 

23Approaching the sentences in the order in which they were directed to be served: -

the offence on 26 June 2012 attracted a non-parole period of 12 months;

the offence of 29 September 2009 attracted an additional non-parole period of 18 months;

the offence committed on 17 April 2010 attracted a further non-parole period of six months, the first 12 months of the 18 month non-parole period imposed for that offence being made concurrent with part of the non-parole period relating to the 29 September 2009 offence;

the offence committed on 20 April 2010 attracted no additional non-parole period, that which was imposed being entirely concurrent with part of the non-parole period imposed in respect of the 17 April 2010 offence.

24Michael Mitchell was not charged with the offence involving Mr Kett which occurred on 17 April 2010 but faced a charge of common assault in consequence of him punching Mr Truong on 26 June 2012, which offence was the subject of a s 166 certificate. That offence arose pursuant to s 61 of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years. 

25The sentences imposed on Michael Mitchell were:

29 September 2009 offence (that involving Mr Salt) - imprisonment for three years including a non-parole period of 18 months both such terms commencing on 28 June 2012;

20 April 2010 offence (that involving Mr Fang) - imprisonment for four years including a non-parole of 18 months both such periods commencing on 28 December 2012;

26 June 2012 offence (that involving Mr Truong) - imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of 12 months both such terms commencing on 28 March 2012;

Assault offence - imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 28 March 2012;

26The effective total sentence imposed on Michael Mitchell was thus of imprisonment of 4 years and 9 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, both such terms commencing on 28 March 2012. Again that was a date agreed as taking into account pre-sentence custody. He is due for release on 27 June 2014.

27Approaching the non-parole periods in a similar manner to that adopted above in the case of those imposed on Joshua: -

the offence committed by Michael on 26 June 2012 attracted a non-parole period of 12 months; 

the assault offence attracted no additional non-parole period, the sentence imposed being entirely concurrent with part of the non-parole period imposed in respect of the 26 June 2012 offence;

the offence committed on 29 September 2009 attracted a 9 month increase in the non-parole period, 9 of the 18 months non-parole imposed in respect of that offence being concurrent with the non-parole period imposed in respect of the 26 June 2012 offence;

the offence committed on 20 April 2010 attracted an increase in the effective non-parole period of 6 months, 12 of the 18 months non-parole period imposed for this offence being coincident with part of the non-parole period imposed in respect of the 29 September 2009 offence.

28The sentences were imposed on 16 August 2013. A notice of appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions was lodged on 17 September 2013 claiming that the ""sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate"" and foreshadowing additional grounds which, though unnecessary, assisted in the orderly presentation of the argument. 

29The grounds pursued by the Crown at the hearing of the appeal were as follows:

Ground One
In the case of each respondent his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence of aggravated robbery upon Mr Fang resulting in a manifestly inadequate sentence for that offence.

Ground Two
In the case of Joshua Mitchell his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence of aggravated robbery upon Mr Kett resulting in a manifestly inadequate sentence for that offence. 

Ground Three
His Honour erred in failing to adequately accumulate the sentences, leading to a manifestly inadequate overall sentence.

Ground Four
His Honour erred in the extent to which he reduced the non-parole period to reflect the finding of special circumstances resulting in a manifestly inadequate non-parole period for each offence and an overall manifestly inadequate non-parole period.

Ground Five
The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate in terms of the individual sentences and the overall sentence.

30In arriving at the sentences he imposed his Honour accepted that some guidance was provided by the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [162] albeit conscious of the fact that there were differences when compared with the characteristics listed by the Chief Justice in that case of:

(i) young offender with no or little criminal history;

(ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;

(iii) limited degree of planning;

(iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;

(v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;

(vi) small amount taken; and

(vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.

31Subsequent cases have made clear that the plea referred to should be understood as a late plea, i.e. one that attracts a discount of or about 10% - R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 at [161]; R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 at [96]. 

32Armitage DCJ's commencing point for the sentence imposed for the offence involving Mr Salt was four years. His Honour recorded that advantage had been taken of Mr Salt's vulnerability and that the amount stolen was in his view not particularly small.

33In the case of the offence involving Mr Kett, his Honour said he regarded it as of ""real significance"" that no permanent injury was inflicted. Although both counsel agreed a 10% discount was appropriate for Joshua's plea, his Honour allowed 12.5% from a starting point of imprisonment for three and a half years. His Honour noted that Mr Kett's age of 72 made him vulnerable and at nighttime more so, and the fact that the offence was committed in company was an aggravating circumstance. He found that the amount taken was not particularly large or small.

34In the case of the offence involving Mr Fang, his Honour was not prepared to find that Joshua Mitchell struck Mr Fang with a cricket bat but that as a participant in the offence he was criminally responsible for that aspect of it. Dealing with this offence his Honour observed:

...I am not persuaded that the Ming Fang offences, if I may so call them, by both offenders are more serious than the typical Henry offence because of the infliction of corporal violence. I do note, however, that the corporal violence was inflicted with a weapon, but I point out that the Crown did not charge armed robbery or robbery while armed with an offensive weapon.

35Apart from the need his Honour perceived for a longer than usual period on parole, and on account of accumulation, His Honour provided no explanation for why the non-parole period imposed on Michael for the offence against Mr Fang was 18 months whereas that imposed on Joshua was 12 months. His Honour had earlier recorded that the agreed facts in respect of this offence for both Joshua and Michael seemed to be the same and said that that both would receive the same sentence for this offence. 

36His Honour indicated that his starting point for the sentences imposed for the aggravated breaking and entering offence was two years and 8 months. His Honour was not prepared to find that the property stolen as an incident of this offence was not of great value although noting that it was recovered. He found that there was limited planning and rejected the submission that the offence was at the lower end of the scale.

37The Crown conceded that given the number of offences, the sentence imposed for Michael's assault offence could be made concurrent with that imposed for the aggravated break enter and steal.

38I turn then to the Respondent's subjective circumstances. Each was the subject of a Pre-Sentence Report, a psychologist's report and a report from a psychiatrist engaged by Justice Health. The various accounts are not all consistent in their detail of the offenders' pasts and the following summary may not be accurate in some of its detail. However the picture is clear. 

39The Respondents' upbringing was appalling. Their parents separated when Joshua was about five-years-old. Their mother worked as a prostitute, sometimes working from home. She and a partner abused drugs. There were needles throughout the house. Her partner was violent towards the Respondents, locking them in cupboards and anally raping them. They were forced to help their mother and her partner steal and commit break and enter offences. Their diet consisted of noodles and mashed potatoes into which, from time to time, amphetamines were mixed. 

40Joshua did not go to school until year three, as his mother was unable to get him ready due to her drug use. He ceased school at age 13. Between the ages of 6 and 13 Joshua was partly brought up by his grandmother.

41Joshua commenced using alcohol at age 11, ecstasy when he was 14, progressing to cannabis, ice, other amphetamines and heroin. The extent of his usage was substantial. He formed a relationship when he was 20 years old and has had one daughter since. He advised the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that that relationship had, for the first time brought some stability into his life and since commencing the relationship his use of illicit substances and alcohol had reduced. It must be said however that the offence involving Mr Truong occurred after this. Joshua's partner gave evidence. His Honour made no findings about her but so far as one can judge from the printed page she would seem to be a positive influence. 

42Joshua has attempted suicide on a number of occasions. He underwent counselling between the ages of 13 and 15. At age 16 he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and bi-polar disorder (although in a psychiatric report of 11 April 2013 from Justice Health that diagnosis was doubted). In that report it is recorded: -

Mr Mitchell gives a chronic history of mood instability, poor impulse control, significant difficulties in controlling his temper, repeated suicidal behaviour, transient stress-related paranoid ideations ...I form the opinion that the mood instability described is attributable to a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder rather than Bipolar Affective Disorder ... 

...Traumatic early childhood is likely to have significantly contributed to his personally traits and his propensity to abuse illicit substances to alleviate any internal distress. 

43An assessment of Joshua made in January 2013 by a psychologist Dr Jacmon observed:

Mr Mitchell's day-to-day functioning is being impaired by post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) and anxiety at clinically significant levels. PTSD apparently arose form the frequent sexual assaults perpetrated on him by his mother's partner ... suicidal ideation is prominent.

44A Pre-Sentence Report includes the following: -

Mr Mitchell is a young man who experienced a childhood marred by the separation of his parents, psychological, physical and sexual abuse, exposure to drug and alcohol abuse within the family home. He spoke of not feeling wanted by his mother during his formative years and the impact that his home life had on him prior to relocating to various other family members' residences.

The offender presented with a multitude of issues including abuse of drugs and alcohol, mental health issues and ongoing issues as a result of his formative years. He acknowledged that he requires assistance in these areas and is verbalising a willingness to engage in appropriate counselling and programmes to assist him with gaining stability in his life and to assisting with not returning to custody...

45His Honour seems to have accepted the tenor of the remarks in these 3 reports.

46Prior to being sentenced, Joshua had completed various courses including drug and alcohol programs. The Pre-Sentence Report recorded that he had been involved in psychological counselling. 

47Joshua was born in February 1991. Thus at the time of the offence against Mr Salt he was 18. He was arrested in June and July 2010 in respect of the offences against Messrs Salt, Kett and Fang and was on conditional liberty at the time of the aggravated breaking entering and stealing offence. In the meantime he had breached his bail on at least three occasions and been rearrested for doing so. 

48By the time of sentence he had been convicted, in June 2010, of receiving or disposing of stolen property, making or furnishing a false statement and having goods in custody for which it appears he had been arrested in March 2010 and, in June 2012, of attempting to dispose of property obtained by theft or a serious indictable offence. Other, more minor, offences can presently be ignored. 

49Armitage DCJ said that he accepted that Joshua was remorseful in respect of those offences to which he had pleaded guilty but not that involving Mr Fang. His Honour assessed Joshua's prospects of not re-offending and rehabilitating himself as reasonable.

50Michael was born in July 1985. Thus he is appreciably older than Joshua. He also was arrested in June and July 2010 in respect of the Salt and Fang matters and in respect of an unrelated matter in April 2011. He was on bail in respect of these three matters at the time of the offence against Mr Truong. The Particulars of Trial do not refer to any breaches of bail although it may be inferred that the matter in respect of which he was arrested in April 2011 constituted such a breach. 

51Michael's record is also more substantial than that of Joshua. Putting aside convictions in his absence, Michael was first convicted in 2002 in respect of assault, affray and having goods in custody. In 2003 and 2004 he committed numerous offences of breaking, entering and stealing for which, either initially or when he was called up, he received mainly bonds or suspended sentences. Conditions imposed included that he attend a drug and alcohol intervention program. There would seem to have been one 10 day period of imprisonment. In 2006 he was convicted of assault and of two offences of driving a vehicle recklessly, furiously or in a speed or manner that was dangerous. For the assault offence a sentence of periodic detention for eight months was imposed. No offences are recorded in the period between May 2006 and April 2011 when he attempted to dispose of property obtained by theft or a serious indictable offence. A Pre-Sentence Report indicates that during the period 2004 to 2008 he commonly failed to comply with the requirements of the Parole authorities

52Michael left school when he was 12-years-old. His longest period of employment has been three weeks. A psychologist's report prepared on behalf of Michael for the purposes of sentencing, recorded that he had spent two years living on the streets, surviving on a daily basis by criminal activities.

53His history of using drugs is similar to Joshua's. Dr Gordon Elliot, a psychiatrist who examined Michael on 23 March 2013 said that he had multiple drug dependencies, severe and of early onset and that: -

It is essential, if Michael is to address his offending behaviour that he receives assertive and long-term treatment for is substance dependencies. Significantly he impressed as being motivated to address his substance misuse and importantly appears to have a partner who is both stable and willing to support him. He is eager to pursue an in-custody drug rehabilitation programme and also to continue this at whatever time he is released from custody.

54Dr Elliott concluded: -

I believe Mr Mitchell's current presentation is far better explained by his background of severe developmental adversity and subsequent personality pathology. He describes a child and adolescent history marked by profound parental neglect, physical and sexual abuse and exposure to illicit substances from an extremely early age. There appears to be an absence of any positive role models in his developmental experiences as he was essentially excluded from any meaningful school experience.

55The latter statement would seem not entirely accurate as there is no doubt that the Respondent's grandmother, who gave evidence and who seems to be respectable and responsible, took the children for some time because of their mother's neglect.

56Psychologist reports of Helen Carney of January and March 2013 include the following: -

On the Clinical Personality Dimensions Mr Mitchell obtained significantly higher scores on five of the seven Depression dimensions; Hypochondriasis, Suicidal Depression, Anxious Depression, Low Energy Depression and Guilt and Resentment and these scores were near the ceiling of the test range...

Mr Mitchell's very high Guilt and Resentment result shows that he is consistently troubled by feelings of guilt and this leads to a sense of worthlessness and self deprecation and he tends to blame himself for anything that goes wrong.

Psychological tests show that Mr Mitchell suffers from a high degree of depression and anxiety, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, schizophrenia and chronic feelings of personal inadequacy. His psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and hearing voices are an indication of schizophrenia and associated like his other serious mental problems with a long history of illicit drug use which has dominated his life since his childhood.

His criminal activities which were due to neglect and the necessity to survive on the streets for many years and his mother and stepfather's exploitation of him and his brothers to assist them to steal in order to support their drug habits and trade meant that the usual societal values of right and wrong would never have been part of Mr Mitchell's social values, learning and personal development. Drugs were employed to manipulate and control Mr Mitchell's behaviour and the effect of this environment has had a devastating effect on his physical development and emotional and mental functioning. His prospects of having a ""normal"" life have been ruined and to date he has not had any full evaluation monitoring or treatment to help him overcome his mental health problems. Part of this lack of opportunity may be due to his own lack of motivation to participate in the counselling and treatment that has been offered to him. However, it is extremely difficult for an individual with Mr Mitchell's degree of depression and psychotic symptoms to participate in the courses available or offered to him as he has never learned to apply himself and persist with any formal or structured experiences as not part of his life.

His severe depression and psychosis mean that he is also prone to self-harm and his past behaviour shows that despite his denials of acting in this manner currently (due to his children's' well being) is very emotionally vulnerable. Mr Mitchell needs a full time rehabilitation course if he is to overcome his drug and mental problems.

57Dr Elliott disagreed with the suggestion that Michael had schizophrenia. Armitage DCJ said that he preferred the diagnosis of Dr Elliott and accordingly this Court should also disregard what Ms Carney said in that connection. 

58Against the tenor of these various reports, it should be mentioned that a number of Pre-Sentence Reports before Armitage DCJ - and there were more than I have quoted - record that at times the Respondents were denying or minimising their offending. A Pre-Sentence Report concerning Michael and dated 9 November 2012 recorded that according to Correctional Services Officers, Michael had commenced employment in the Metal Shop, that he was compliant, interacted well with other inmates but was disinterested in working.

59His Honour said that he accepted that Michael also was remorseful in respect of those offences to which he had pleaded guilty but not that involving Mr Fang. He accepted that Michael was committed to rehabilitation and concluded that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable. In that regard his Honour referred to the evidence of Michael's partner who gave evidence and whom his Honour described as a mature and sensible young lady who has had no prior contact with the police and supportive of the offender.

60His Honour recorded a concession by the Crown that the mental illness of both Respondents was a mitigating factor on sentence in that time in prison would be more difficult. In the case of both offenders his Honour found special circumstances because of the accumulation of sentences and in the need for a longer than usual period on parole for them to address education and drug rehabilitation.

61I turn to the grounds of appeal. 

Ground 1

62The first part of this ground must be upheld. When one has regard to the violence and injuries inflicted on Mr Fang and compares them with the characteristic of ""limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof"", his Honour's conclusion that this offence was not more serious that the typical offence referred to in R v Henry was clearly wrong. Certainly the cricket bat was not as inherently dangerous as a knife but this difference is not sufficient to offset the violence and injuries to which Mr Fang was exposed. Furthermore, his Honour's remark, ""the Crown did not charge armed robbery or robbery while armed with an offensive weapon"" was nothing to the point. The maximum penalty for those offences was no greater than that for the offence that was charged. Also aggravating the offence against Mr Fang compared with one having the characteristics described by the Chief Justice was the fact that it was committed in company - see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(2)(e). 

63In short, this offence was substantially more serious than the typical one described by the Chief Justice in R v Henry. 

64The second aspect of this ground can best be dealt with later in these Reasons.

Ground 2

65The first part of this ground must also be upheld. While there was no knife or similar weapon, as his Honour recorded there was appreciable planning and the offence was committed in company. Furthermore his Honour erred in placing ""real significance"" on the fact that Mr Kett suffered no permanent injury. Some injury would have been a further aggravation and, if it amounted to wounding or grievous bodily harm, would have rendered the Joshua liable to a heavier penalty than prescribed for the offence with which he was charged. It will rarely, if at all, be a matter of mitigation that an offender does not commit a worse offence.

Grounds 3, 4 and 5

66These grounds can most conveniently be considered together.

67There can be no doubt that by comparison with sentences generally imposed, some of the aspects of the sentences imposed on the Respondent were extraordinarily lenient. 

68This is most obvious in the sentences imposed for the offence against Mr Fang, viz. four years, which is the bottom of the range suggested in R v Henry even though the Respondents had pleaded not guilty and were not entitled to the discount (of about five months) reflected in the four year figure. Furthermore, as I have said, given the violence in the attack and the consequences to Mr Fang, the Respondents' offence was substantially more serious than the one instanced by the Chief Justice in that case. It is to be noted also that Michael, even if at age 24 he could be described, as a ""young offender"" certainly did not fall into the category of one having ""no or little criminal history"". 

69I of course accept that R v Henry presents as a guide and is not prescriptive or a ""tramline"" - Legge v R [2007] NSWCCA 244 at [40], [59] - and that caution is needed when comparing it with cases where there is no weapon - see R v Tortell and Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [14] - but the matters to which I have just referred make it at least surprising that his Honour could have imposed the sentences he did for the offence involving Mr Fang. 

70The sentence imposed for the offence involving Mr Kett is also appreciably below the R v Henry range, no doubt at least in part because of his Honour's error in regarding the absence of permanent injuries as mitigating. However, because of his plea Joshua was entitled to a greater discount than contemplated in R v Henry and it is impossible to regard the length of the total sentence imposed for this offence as manifestly inadequate. 

71A similar conclusion must be reached in the case of the sentences imposed for the offences against Mr Salt. 

72Unless justified on the grounds of totality - and his Honour did not suggest this as a reason - the sentences imposed for the aggravated break enter and steal offences were also surprisingly low. His Honour provided no reason why, against the standard non-parole period of five years, he imposed on both offenders a non-parole period of only 12 months and a full term of two years for the break enter and steal offence, particularly given the fact that at the time both were on conditional liberty and Michael had a significant record for similar offences in his past. His Honour cannot have been conscious of, or ignored, what this Court said in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; [2007] 171 A Crim R 267 on the topic of break, enter and steal offences.

73Unusually lenient also was the limited degree of accumulation ordered by his Honour. In the case of Michael, he was required to serve only three months for the break, enter and steal and the assault on Mr Truong before his sentence for robbing Mr Salt commenced and then only a further six months before the start of his sentence for the robbery of Mr Fang. As has been said, the 18 month non-parole period for that offence meant this total non-parole period was but two years and three months and this for one aggravated break and enter and two robberies, one of which was a very serious offence. 

74At least in part to reflect his involvement in a fourth offence, viz. the robbery of Mr Kett, Joshua's non-parole period was nine months longer. Certainly the sentence for the offence against Mr Salt was fully accumulated on the non-parole period for the aggravated break and enter offence, but the accumulation of each of the sentences for the offences against Mr Kett and Mr Fang was but six months. Furthermore the end date for those non-parole sentences was the same, resulting also in a very lenient non-parole period.

75The effective total sentences - six years in the case of Joshua and four years, nine months in the case of Michael were also surprisingly lenient.

76Of course, his Honour had to factor in the subjective circumstances of the Respondents. Notwithstanding that their conduct demonstrated that the community needed protection from them, their upbringing and mental states certainly argued for a degree of leniency. Given the age at, and circumstances in which it commenced, their drug taking was, as the Crown conceded, also a matter of mitigation - see R v Henry at [194], [233], [235], [238]. On the other hand, Michael had been before the courts sufficiently often to have had it brought home to him that dishonesty was unacceptable and while Joshua prior to the instant offences seems to have been arrested only once, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that he also must have had such knowledge. Indeed, it is reasonably inferred that when, under the influence of their stepfather, they assisted him in crime, he would have impressed on them that they should not get caught and they must have realised that society did not approve of such conduct. 

77In the result, and notwithstanding the Respondent's appalling past and other subjective features, the conclusion at which I have arrived is that the sentences imposed on the Respondents for the robbery of Mr Fang and the effective total sentences, both in their overall length and the length of the non-parole period, were manifestly inadequate. A proper sentence for the former offence should not have been less than six years. Bearing in mind the difference in their charges but Michael's substantially worse record, a proper total sentence for each should not have been less than eight years, including an effective non-parole period of five years. 

78The question then arises what this Court should do. Under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it has a discretion to dismiss the appeal notwithstanding the above conclusions. In that connection, affidavits which the Crown did not challenge or dispute, were put before the Court as to the Respondents' performance and situation in custody. Michael's affidavit asserts that there have been no disciplinary charges against him, that he has been drug free for 17 months, has completed a ""Getting Smart"" program, is studying, attends a weekly session with a psychologist from whom he has ""received feedback ... that she believes I am not the same angry person I used to be and can not deal more positively with my emotions"". His father, children and partner (who it will be remembered impressed his Honour) visit him regularly.

79Michael has but four months to go before his existing non-parole period expires. It would no doubt be traumatic - indeed given his past, greatly traumatic - for him to have over another 2 years added to his non-parole period at this time. The indications are that he has a degree of stability that he has not had in the past and, given his past emotional and mental functioning, including attempts at suicide, I am of the view that the Court should not run the risk of damaging what has been achieved. 

80Joshua's affidavit indicates that he seems to have participated in significantly more courses and work than Michael, in order to ""change myself"" but also seems to have found prison more difficult. Joshua's non-parole period does not expire until December 2014, hence some of the above remarks do not apply with the same force but considerations of parity argue for this Court to deal with him in the same way as it deals with his brother.

81I would dismiss both Crown appeals. 

82That conclusion makes it unnecessary for me to direct attention to the fourth ground relied on by the Crown, unexplained inconsistencies between the sentences imposed on the two Respondents or an argument advanced on behalf of the Respondents that to increase their sentences would result in a lack of parity with co-offenders.

83As I have said, I would dismiss both Crown appeals.

2763537,Mortada v R [2014] NSWCCA 36,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The appellant Mr Mortada appeals from his conviction of an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). It was not disputed on appeal that the trial judge committed appellable error in failing to give a warning about the use of propensity reasoning in his summing up of evidence adduced over the previous six weeks. His Honour had indicated, both informally during argument, and also in his formal ruling admitting the evidence, that he would do so, but neither the Crown nor the defence reminded him of this three weeks later. The Crown's approach to the appeal was either that leave should not be granted, or else that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).

2This appeal therefore turns on two narrow points. The first is whether, as the Crown contends, Mr Mortada's counsel at the end of the trial made a deliberate forensic decision not to ask for a direction as to propensity reasoning in relation to some of the evidence in the Crown case. The Crown said that if the decision were deliberate, then leave to appeal under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused. For the reasons which follow, we are not satisfied that the failure was the result of a deliberate forensic decision.

3The second requires an examination of all of the evidence in the trial. The Crown made no submission in the appeal resisting the appellant's main proposition, namely, that if the failure to seek a direction was inadvertent, there was appellable error. Instead, the Crown contended that even so, this Court could and should find that a guilty verdict was inevitable. The appellant's case was that the consequence of the failure to give the propensity direction was that he had lost a real chance of acquittal, with the result that the proviso could not be applied. For the reasons which follow, we conclude that the appellate record (principally, the incontrovertible documentary and telephonic and fingerprinting evidence) made a guilty verdict inevitable, and that there has not been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Applying the proviso, the appeal should be dismissed.

Procedural history

4The appellant, Mr Ali Youssef Mortada, was born in Lebanon and married his wife Manal there. He came with his wife to Australia in 2000 when he was 21. They had two daughters. He became an Australian citizen in 2005 but subsequently returned to Lebanon. In 2008 he and his wife obtained what was described as a ""reversible"" divorce (there was evidence that such a divorce could be reversed by court order, although regarded as effective under Islamic law; the evidence was not entirely clear, but nothing turns on it for present purposes). 

5Importantly, Mr Mortada visited Australia in October 2008, where a customs officer, Mr Jerome Singh, detained him, and made a record of some of the items in his possession. He visited Australia again in 2009, arriving on a Malaysia Airlines flight in business class on 20 May 2009. He was arrested on the morning of 17 June 2009 shortly before he was scheduled to return to Lebanon. 

6Mr Mortada was charged on indictment with three offences. The first was supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, being 496.75 grams, contrary to ss 25(2) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Counts 2 and 3 were dealing with two amounts of cash ($16,350 and $21,930) being the proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). (The second count had originally extended to an amount of US$2,800, but the indictment was amended, by consent, to remove the foreign currency amount late in the trial.)

7On 28 September 2012, after slightly more than a day of deliberation, a jury returned verdicts of guilty on all three counts, following a six week trial, at which Mr Mortada was represented by Mr Kintominas of counsel, an experienced barrister who had been in practice for more than two decades. Mr Mortada was sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months, expiring 4 May 2018. The maximum penalty for the supply count is imprisonment for 20 years, a fine of 3,500 penalty units, or both. A standard non-parole period of 10 years applies to the offence. In respect of this count, Mr Mortada was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 6 years. The sentences imposed for the second and third counts were wholly concurrent and for a period of 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, expiring 4 September 2013. 

8A notice of appeal against conviction was filed, out of time, on 1 August 2013. A series of notices of intention to appeal had previously been filed, but these had expired. A further application for extension of time was not filed in time, through inadvertence (to which the appellant's solicitor deposed). In the circumstances, the Crown did not oppose the (short) extension of time required by the appellant, and in our opinion it is appropriate for it to be granted. 

9The appeal was heard some four months after it was commenced. Nevertheless, the consequence of the delay in commencing it was that Mr Mortada has now served the entirety of the non-parole periods of the sentences for the second and third counts for which he was convicted. The appeal did not extend to either of those convictions. 

10Although there were two grounds of appeal, senior counsel for the appellant conceded that the second could not stand by itself. Other than to record that in our view that concession was properly made, it is unnecessary to say anything about the second ground. 

First ground of appeal

11The first ground of appeal is in these terms: 

""A miscarriage of justice was caused by the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury (a) about how the evidence which the Crown relied upon to prove the actual supplies of prohibited drugs could be used to prove the deemed supply charge in Count 1; (b) that such evidence could not be used as propensity evidence.""

12Given the Crown's attitude to that ground - in effect, relying on the proviso if Mr Kintominas' evidence of inadvertent error be accepted - it is necessary to turn to the nature of the parties' case at trial.

Nature of the cases at trial

(a) Overview

13On the evening of 18 June 2009, police in the company of hotel staff executed a search warrant on Room 1417 of the Sheraton on the Park, a hotel in central Sydney on Elizabeth St. A video recording was made at the time. A sealed bag containing 496.75 grams of heroin was found in a suitcase in the room. Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act provides that a traffickable quantity of heroin is 3 grams and a commercial quantity is 250 grams. Section 29 deems a person who has in his or her possession more than the traffickable quantity to have it for the purposes of supply. 

14There was a deal of evidence (which it will be necessary to summarise below) capable of connecting Mr Mortada to the heroin found in that room. There was also evidence capable of connecting the heroin to Mr Abbas El Dirani, who had a close relationship with Mr Mortada (this was undisputed, and evidenced for example by extensive telephone records), who flew into Australia on the same flight on 20 May 2009, and who was arrested at the same time as, and in the company of, Mr Mortada. At the time of the trial, there was evidence that Mr El Dirani had returned to Lebanon after having been granted bail over the opposition of the police, and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest.

15The appellant's case was that Mr El Dirani had impersonated him. He said that Mr El Dirani had booked the room at the Sheraton in the appellant's name in order to protect himself. A number of items discovered in the room were consistent with Mr El Dirani being present in the room and therefore the person who had possession of the drugs and money found there. The appellant said that he had no knowledge of the room, that he had not occupied it and that neither the heroin nor money found there belonged to him.

16Accordingly, the central issue in the trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the heroin was in the possession of Mr Mortada. The Crown case was that the appellant and Mr El Dirani were involved in a joint criminal enterprise for the supply of a prohibited drug. 

17Mr Mortada did not deny that he was a friend of Mr El Dirani. He gave evidence that as well as being a plumber, he was a folkloric keyboard player and Mr El Dirani was a singer, whom the appellant had met in 2006, and that both had thereafter performed at weddings or birthday parties in Syria, Dubai, the Ukraine, Yemen and Africa, as well as in Australia. 

18Mr Mortada gave evidence on 18 and 19 September, and was cross-examined on 19, 20, 21, 24 and 25 September 2012 (with other defence witnesses being interposed). Mr Mortada's positive defence at trial and in his submissions on appeal was that he had visited Australia in order to play in four musical performances and to collect money he was owed from various plumbing jobs (there were no receipts tendered, but his clients gave evidence that they paid cash). He claimed he had been staying with friends in Punchbowl, who both gave evidence: Ms Hanan Moussa and Mr Rabieh El Dirani. The defence said, and the Crown did not submit to the contrary, that ""El Dirani"" was a relatively common name; for the purposes of these reasons, and without intending any disrespect to them, we shall refer to the couple as Hanan and Rabieh to avoid confusion with Mr Abbas El Dirani.

19Mr Mortada said that he knew nothing of Room 1417 in the Sheraton on the Park. He said that the explanation for much of the evidence linking him to the heroin found in the hotel room was that Mr El Dirani had access to and had used his credit card and driver's licence, to make it appear that the heroin was Mr Mortada's. It will be necessary to return to the details of his defence below; its ""general thrust"", to use the words of the trial judge (spoken in the absence of the jury) was simple: ""blacken Mr El Dirani wherever possible. That's been made very clear from about day one"". 

20It was common ground that a person can ""possess"" a chattel even if it is not in his or her manual possession. As Hunt J said in Dib & Dib v R (1991) 52 A Crim R 64 at 66-67:

""[The accused] must have that property either in his manual possession or in a place to which he (and any person acting in concert with him) may go without physical bar in order to obtain such manual possession of it.

Where (as in the present case) the Crown seeks to establish an accused's possession of property found not within his manual possession but rather in premises to which he has access, it must - in order to establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused rather than anyone else who had such possession of that property - persuade the jury that the accused has the legal right to exclude all persons from the premises in which the property is situated (other than those acting in concert with him).""

21It has been observed that it may be clearer to refer to ""acting jointly"" rather than ""acting in concert"" in this context: Lee v R [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [267] (Beech-Jones J, Basten JA and Hall J agreeing). As Beech-Jones J said in that appeal at [280], a ""fundamental aspect"" of the concept of possession in this context is exclusive control of the chattel. 

22Applying those principles to the circumstances of the trial, it was not disputed that it was sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Mortada had occupied Room 1417 where the heroin was found. However, the Crown assumed the burden of excluding the possibility that Mr El Dirani had occupied the room, to the exclusion of Mr Mortada, although it was booked in his name. There was no suggestion in the defence case that Mr Mortada had occupied the hotel room and that Mr El Dirani (or someone else) had somehow secretly stored the heroin there without Mr Mortada's knowledge. The issue was binary: either Mr Mortada had occupied the room and was therefore in possession of the heroin, or else he had nothing to do with the room.

(b) Discovery of the heroin

23On 17 June 2009 a member of the security staff at the Hilton Hotel in Sydney (which is a few blocks from the Sheraton and has entrances on both George and Pitt Streets) observed Mr Mortada and Mr El Dirani sitting in the foyer for an extended period of time, behaving suspiciously, (including by making multiple calls on different mobile phones). He called the police, who after observing the pair, approached and searched them. Counsel for Mr Mortada did not suggest that the search was other than lawful. It commenced not before 10:57am in the morning; Mr Mortada's flight was at 2pm. (The time can be determined with precision by reference to the mobile phone records which were prominent in both the Crown and defence cases. One of the handsets found on Mr El Dirani made 21 calls on the morning of 17 June, including calls at 10:50, 10:54, 10:55 and 10:57; thereafter no calls were made for more than 4 hours. One of the handsets found on Mr Mortada made 13 calls on the morning of 17 June, including calls or text messages at 10:46, 10:47, 10:47 and 10:48.) Mr Mortada was found to have three mobile phones, Mr El Dirani two. The police also discovered $16,350 in $50 and $100 dollar bills on Mr Mortada's person, which cash is the subject of the jury's verdict on the second count of the indictment, and is unchallenged on appeal. Mr Mortada told the police that the money was payment for a plumbing job. A large quantity of cash was also found on Mr El Dirani. Both men were arrested, and separately detained. Eventually, both were granted bail. 

24Police applied for search warrants for the two hotel rooms in which the men were believed to be staying: Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park, and Room 3213 at the Hilton Hotel. Their initial application was refused. On the following day, 18 June 2009, staff from the Hilton Hotel discovered a substantial amount of cash in the safe of that room ($160,050), as well as international money transfer slips indicating that a sum of $56,750 had been transferred from Australia to Lebanon. The police again applied for a search warrant, and this time one was issued, for Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park. The search was recorded with sound and video, in the presence of the night duty manager. The 496.75 grams of heroin was discovered during that search. Police also discovered $21,930 in the safe, which amount was the subject of the third count, and again, the jury's verdict is unchallenged in this appeal. 

(c) Evidence linking the appellant to Room 1417

25On any view, there was a great deal of documentary and circumstantial evidence connecting the appellant with Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park. It will be necessary, ultimately, to address the detail of that evidence, given the Crown's reliance on the proviso and the need for this court to ""review the whole record of the trial"": Weiss at [47]. It is convenient in the first instance to give a summary of some of the evidence, while at the same time identifying the defence case in response.

26First, the Sheraton on the Park registration slip was completed in the name of Mr Mortada. It gave Mr Mortada's mobile phone number and email address and appeared to have been signed by him, although a handwriting expert could not exclude the possibility that ""somebody who is very skilful at simulating other people's writing"" could have forged the signature. Mr Mortada denied it was his signature.

27Secondly, the pre-authorisation payment for the room, dated 11 June 2009, was made on a Visa card discovered in Mr Mortada's possession when he was arrested. The same Visa card had also been in his possession when he was the subject of a random check by a Customs officer, Mr Jerome Singh, at Sydney airport on 29 October 2008.

28Thirdly, the Visa card's issuer had provided a facility whereby a text message would be sent to one of Mr Mortada's mobile phones (a Nokia 8800 ""Sapphire"") when certain transactions were processed. That phone was in Mr Mortada's possession when he was arrested, and a text message was discovered on it which recorded a transaction for $1,795 at the Sheraton on the Park on 11 June 2009 (""The transaction on your card ending 2140 was accepted for AUD 1,795.00 at Sheraton On The Park in Sydney in AUS on 11/06/09 at 03:19""). Mr Mortada gave evidence that he was aware of the message, asked Mr El Dirani about it, and said that Mr El Dirani told him that he had used Mr Mortada's credit card. 

29Fourthly, when taken into custody, Mr Mortada was fingerprinted. The form recording his fingerprints contains handwriting stated his address as ""SHERATON HOTEL SYDNEY"". The form states that the day of birth, signature and address ""must be written by the person whose fingerprints are taken"". Mr Mortada agreed that the signature and date of birth were written in his hand, but suggested that he wrote an address suggested by the police. The police officer denied telling Mr Mortada to state the Sheraton Hotel as his address; he said that he told Mr Mortada that he could not put down an address in Lebanon, but instead that he should put down the address where he was staying. At the end of the trial, when Mr Mortada was cross-examined, he said that the police officer had given him a separate piece of paper on which was written ""Sheraton Hotel"" which he had copied out; this had not been put to the police officer. 

30Fifthly, various personal documents were found in Room 1417 relating to Mr Mortada's ex-wife, including authorised translations of his marriage certificate and divorce certificate, each dated 27 October 2008 (two days before his arrival in Australia in 2008). They also included a Commonwealth Bank statement, which had been sent to a Punchbowl Post Office box, with transactions up to 29 May 2009, for an account in the names of Mr Mortada and his (former) wife. Mr Mortada said that he had kept his personal papers in a pocket of a bag he used to carry his musical instrument, but had given them to Mr El Dirani at a concert the previous weekend, and he had not returned them despite having been asked repeatedly to do so.

31Sixthly, there were also documents relating to two car hire agreements in Mr Mortada's name, which referred to a driver's licence number which matched one of those in his possession (see further below). There was also in evidence a sales voucher from the car hire company, with an imprint of the same Visa card in Mr Mortada's name and seemingly signed by Mr Mortada. Mr Mortada gave evidence that Mr El Dirani hired a rental car in his name because he didn't have a driver's licence. 

32Seventhly, the safe in Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park contained a ""Nokia N95"" mobile phone. Mr Mortada's counsel at trial conceded that it had the same 15 digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number as a phone which had been discovered on Mr Mortada's person in October 2008 (when he was subjected to a random search by a customs officer at Sydney Airport) and there was uncontroversial evidence that the first 14 digits of an IMEI number are unique to the handset. The N95 contained incoming messages of a personal nature linking it to Mr Mortada close to the time he was arrested. Mr Mortada accepted it contained personal photos of him (holding a pet dog) and of Mr El Dirani and his brother (holding a stag shot in Africa in March 2009). Mr Mortada said that he gave the mobile phone to Mr El Dirani in March 2009 when his friend needed a phone and had not thereafter seen it. 

33Eighthly, some lithium carbonate (a prescription medicine) was found in Room 1417. Lithium carbonate had also been found in Mr Mortada's possession when he had been searched at Sydney Airport in 2008. Mr Mortada accepted that he had been prescribed the drug, he had a letter from a pharmacist explaining that it was medicinal, but he said that he had ceased taking it after a month.

34Ninthly, the Legal Aid duty solicitor who appeared on behalf of Mr Mortada on three occasions, including on 18 and 22 June 2009 and visited him once in gaol, gave evidence that he had gone to the Sheraton on the Park in order to collect Mr Mortada's belongings sometime thereafter, having been authorised in writing by Mr Mortada to do so. Mr Mortada denied that he had authorised him to do so. No written authorisation was in evidence, but there was no doubt that this had occurred. The solicitor said he had practised for 30 years and had been asked to go to a hotel room five or six times. Mr Mortada denied having asked the solicitor to attend (""I know nothing about this""; ""I am saying there was no conversation between myself and the solicitor""). It was not disputed that a suitcase was delivered by the solicitor to Mr Mortada's friends Rabieh and Hanan with whom he claimed he had been staying. They gave evidence that they did not recognise the clothes or the suitcase, and discarded both, but only after discovering some high quality fake driver's licences, including one in Mr Mortada's name, which were given to Mr Mortada and tendered at the trial. The defence relied on the fake driver's licences to support the possibility that Mr El Dirani was well able to impersonate Mr Mortada. The Crown called evidence that the driver's licences were manufactured after Mr Mortada had been arrested (they were only provided to the Crown after Mr Mortada was released on bail, some thirteen months after his arrest). 

35There was much more evidence than has been summarised above. But what is of greatest importance for the issues raised on appeal is the documentary evidence relating to the transfer of large sums of money from Australia to other countries, overwhelmingly to Lebanon. It is this evidence, which is consistent with dealing in the proceeds of crime, for which Mr Mortada was not charged, which was to be the subject of the jury direction as to propensity reasoning. 

(d) The Western Union receipts and Post-It notes

36Many ""Western Union"" money transfer slips and receipts were found in the safe in Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park. They were dated between 27 February and 16 June 2009, but the majority were dated in the period 21 May to 16 June 2009 (when Mr Mortada was in Australia). Most, but not all, reflected transfers of money effected at Punchbowl Post Office. In each case the amount was less than $10,000. The total amount was $945,618. 

37In each case the transfer showed the name, address, phone number and either passport number or driver's licence number of the transferor, and the name of the transferee. There was evidence that almost all of the driver's licence and passport numbers did not correspond with official records. Many had Mr Mortada's fingerprints on them; there were also some fingerprints which could not be identified. There was also qualified expert evidence that some of the handwriting was that of Mr Mortada. None of the transfers were identified as having Mr El Dirani's fingerprints on them, although the fingerprinting expert had compared every fingerprint against both Mr Mortada's and Mr El Dirani's fingerprint records. 

38To take two examples, there is a record of a transfer of $4800 made at 3.42pm on 12 June 2009 from Imad Assad Dilbani to Alif Kassem. The sender identified himself by a driver's licence which did not correspond to that in government records. A second recorded a transfer of $4700 from Aida Aldirani to Salim Aldirani in Lebanon at 11.25am on Saturday 13 June 2009. Ms Aldirani provided an Australian passport number, but there was no record of a passport of that number on the Immigration database. There was evidence that all save one of the passports were either not recorded on the Immigration database, or else the passport number did not match the person named. 

39Whilst most of the driver's licence numbers were also non-existent, two of them did match records. One of those two was that of Ms Hanan Moussa, with whom Mr Mortada said he was staying, and who was called in the defence case. That transaction was a transfer of $9,440 to Ms Manal El Dirani, Mr Mortada's former wife, at 2.46pm on Friday 12 June 2009. It was a transfer which took place at Roselands, not Punchbowl Post Office. Ms Moussa denied in cross-examination that she made that transaction, or that she lent her driver's licence to either Mr El Dirani or Mr Mortada.

40The police officer in charge of the investigation obtained a warrant to inspect the CCTV records of the Punchbowl Post Office, and reviewed the people at the counter when the transfers were effected. On various occasions men and women of Middle Eastern appearance were shown, on other occasions, there was no one at the counter at all when the transaction was recorded. Some of the transfers are recorded as having been effected late in the evening. At no time did the officer recognise anyone who looked like Mr Mortada.

41Also found in Room 1417 at the Sheraton on the Park were 40 pink and yellow ""Post-It"" notes recording the names and phone numbers of various persons in handwriting. When Mr Mortada had been searched in 2008, nine Post-It notes had been located on his person. It was formally conceded that the 40 Post-It notes in the safe included the very same notes found by Mr Singh on Mr Mortada in 2008, save that some names and amounts had been crossed out and replaced with others. That concession was possible because Mr Singh had taken a photocopy of those nine Post-It notes, and the photocopy had been kept and was tendered at the trial. At the same time, the trial judge told the jury that there was ""certainly, and absolutely, no inference to be drawn against Mr Mortada by virtue of the fact that a search was conducted of him by the immigration people at the airport when he arrived in the October of 2008."" 

42Each Post-It note stated a ""From:"" name, passport or driver's licence number, expiry date, date of birth, telephone number, address, and a ""To:"" name. For example, one stated ""From: Mamoun Dazzar"", gave a passport number and expiry date and date of birth, an address in Condell Park, and a ""To:"" name, Mohamad Daour. 

43Mr Mortada's fingerprints were on some of the Post-It notes found in the safe. 

44There were also links between the Post-It notes and the Western Union transfers and receipts. For example, there was a Western Union transfer and receipt dated 12 June 2009 for a transfer of $4500 from Mamoun Dazzar at 2.47pm that afternoon, made at the Punchbowl Post Office.

45Mr Mortada admitted that he had written the nine Post-It notes; his evidence was that Mr El Dirani had provided him with the information to give to Mr El Dirani's brother (Ahmad) in 2008, that the paper had been soiled on his flight, that he had written out the names again on Post-It notes and given them to Ahmad (together with some underpants and socks from his mother). He said that Ahmad had given him the Western Union transfers and receipts sometime when he was in Australia in 2009, and asked him to give them to Mr Abbas El Dirani, which he did. That was how, according to Mr Mortada, his fingerprints came to be on the documents. 

(e) The defence objection and request for a direction

46The trial judge ruled after argument on the 13th day of the trial that evidence of substantial transfers of funds to Lebanon linked to Mr Mortada (through his fingerprints being upon Western Union receipts) was relevant to connecting the appellant to the room in the Sheraton on the Park. However, his Honour accepted the submission of Mr Mortada's counsel that: 

""The inference could be drawn that my client was in a conspiracy with El Dirani, and perhaps others, to see [that] large amount of money came out of Australia via the disbursement or dissemination in amounts under the Cash Transactions Reports Act limit which require formal notification. And that this would be a way of getting the money out of [the] country. I expect that that's going to be the suggestion in any event in respect of the Western Union transfers that are found but what the inference will be, and an almost inescapable inference will be, that, as your Honour identified, that my client was involved in drug dealing on his last trip here. If that evidence gets before the jury, and I'm talking only about the scraps of paper, if that evidence gets before the jury, it has an overwhelming prejudice in the sense that, in my submission, there's no direction your Honour could give them. I mean, I'm sure your Honour could give them a carefully crafted direction which explain the dangers et cetera, but it is so prejudicial it's the kind of prejudice that can't be cured by direction.

...

In my submission, whether the scraps of paper were written on by my client in 2008 or not, they will have the effect of making the jury gravely and strongly suspect, and I would say jump to the conclusion, that he was involved in drug running in 2008. He [has] not been charged with that and ... we say [that would be an] illegitimate inference. But it is a powerful seductive inference. One so powerfully seducing that we say that a direction from your Honour will not cure it.""

47This objection was raised fairly late in the trial, in connection with the evidence of Mr Singh, and after the Crown had opened on, and tendered, a deal of material capable of supporting propensity reasoning. The ""scraps of paper"" to which Mr Kintominas was referring were notes containing identity information which was linked to the Western Union transfers. There was a lack of precision in the hearing of the appeal, and the formulation of the direction that it was said should have been given, but that was a consequence, it may be inferred, of the stance taken by the Crown on the appeal, confining its submissions to the two points mentioned at the outset. In those circumstances, the appropriate course is to proceed on the basis, favourable to the appellant, that the missing direction extended to the Post-It notes and the Western Union transfers and the other ""scraps of paper"" which could be linked with Mr Mortada and with dealing in the proceeds of crime.

48The trial judge indicated his view, during the course of argument, that the prejudice could be cured by directions, and that that was the course he was obliged to take. His Honour was plainly sensitive to the prejudicial effect of the evidence, and confined the Crown tender to the eleven pieces of paper showing the exact identities, addresses and details of those people also shown in the Post-It notes. His Honour subsequently gave a formal ruling on the objections, which included this passage:

""[Restricting the tender to 11 pieces of paper] minimises the prejudice of any suggestion of a much wider course of dealing. Properly directed there should not be any reasoning or emotional difficulties with the evidence when limited as it is.""

Issues on the appeal

49It is convenient to pause to observe what is not in issue in this appeal. On the one hand, it was not said by the defence that Mr Singh's evidence was wrongly admitted, because the trial judge had erred in concluding that its prejudice could be met by an appropriate direction. Nor was it said that any of the other evidence which could support illegitimate propensity reasoning (the Western Union transfers and receipts and the Post-It notes) was improperly admitted. That is so notwithstanding that Mr Kintominas had submitted that it was ""the kind of prejudice that can't be cured by direction"".

50On the other hand, it was not submitted by the Crown that there had not been an error in failing to give a direction. In BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275, the failure to give a direction that relevant evidence could not be used to support propensity reasoning led to a guilty verdict being set aside and a new trial ordered. That was a sexual assault case, but the reasoning extends to all cases ""where there is a real risk that the jury may engage in inappropriate propensity reasoning"": R v Giovannone [2002] NSWCCA 323; 140 A Crim 1 at [99]. This was plainly such a case. As Mason P stated in Giovannone, such a direction must be given wherever necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of injustice. 

51The stance taken by the Crown meant that there was no dispute, for the purposes of the appeal, that the evidence of actual supply of drugs on previous occasions (including the Western Union money transfers and the Post-It notes) should have been subject of a direction to the effect that that evidence could be used to link Mr Mortada to the hotel room, but could not be used for improper propensity reasoning.

52The Crown's response to the appeal was confined to two propositions. The first was that the absence of a propensity direction was the deliberate forensic decision of counsel appearing for Mr Mortada, which was by itself a complete answer to the failure to give a direction. The second was that the Crown submitted that a guilty verdict was inevitable, in the sense that it was the only verdict open to the jury on the evidence. We deal with each in turn.

A deliberate forensic decision?

53The Crown submitted that it was more likely than not that Mr Kintominas made a forensic decision not to seek directions as to propensity reasoning. If so, then it submitted that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should not be granted. (There may be a question whether in fact r 4 applies, given that a broader objection had been taken by Mr Kintominas at trial. No argument was directed to that issue, and on the view that we take, it is sufficient to assume, without deciding, that the rule applies and requires a grant of leave.)

54The Crown invited the Court to infer that a deliberate forensic decision had been taken because it had been the appellant's case at trial that there was a wealth of evidence connecting Mr El Dirani and the buying and selling of drugs. In closing address counsel said this: 

""One of the things that will strike you, ... of course is that if you have a look at El Dirani's phone messages the defence says it's very clear that he is involved in selling and buying drugs. There's the messages about paper up front. ... [T]here's plenty of messages there that you would infer that Abbas El Dirani is dealing in drugs.""

55Accordingly, so it was said, it was in the appellant's interests for there not to be a propensity direction; in substance, the appellant was inviting the jury to use propensity evidence to conclude that Mr El Dirani had been a drug dealer. But there was no evidence from the Crown Prosecutor as to any agreement with Mr Kintominas about not seeking a direction, or for that matter (if it were relevant) why she did not draw to the judge's attention what his Honour had ruled in relation to Mr Singh's evidence.

56Mr Kintominas, counsel for Mr Mortada at the trial, gave affidavit evidence sworn and served shortly before the appeal was heard to the effect that the trial lasted longer than had been scheduled, and clashed with a pre-arranged holiday. He arranged for junior counsel (his former reader) to be junior counsel at the trial. She commenced appearing in around week four of the trial, and Mr Kintominas left, with the consent of the trial judge, during the summing up. He swore in his affidavit unequivocally that:

""I did not at any stage turn my mind to the Judge giving the jury a direction about how the jury could use and should not use evidence of actual supply of prohibited drugs, namely, the Post-It notes, the Western Union money transfers or other evidence of that type to prove Count One (the deemed supply charge).""

...

I did not make any forensic decision not to seek the directions the appellant now relies on in this appeal. 

I did not seek or obtain any instructions from my solicitor or the appellant in relation to the issue of the directions the appellant now relies on in this appeal. I did not have any discussions with [junior counsel] about these directions.""

57Mr Kintominas was cross-examined before this Court, at some length. That took place without objection, or argument, and the fact that this Court permitted it to occur is not to be taken as an endorsement of the practice in a case such as the present. Normally, as Basten JA has said, ""statements as to counsel's beliefs are of doubtful relevance"": Lee at [139]. On the view that we take, it is not necessary to express a view as to the circumstances when evidence of this nature is admissible; cf Gillies v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2008] NSWCCA 339 at [25]-[28]. 

58Mr Kintominas maintained consistently in cross-examination that he had a clear recollection of aspects of the trial, and denied making any forensic decision not to seek a direction. He was taken to his objection to the tender of the Western Union receipts, and the trial judge's admission of them, on the basis that in due course a direction as to the use of propensity evidence would be given, and asked:

""Q. So at the stage that you were at in the summing up you were aware weren't you that in the course of directions his Honour had given to the jury to the point the summing up began, that is, earlier in the trial directions of the type which you had originally believed would be given by the learned trial judge proscribing prohibited propensity reasoning had not by the beginning of the summing up been so given to the jury by the judge?

A. I should have been able to work it out but it was not something that crossed my mind. I was preoccupied with a number of other matters.

Q. Didn't you know it as a fact that those directions hadn't been given before the beginning of the summing up at the time the summing up began?

A. I obviously had the material to ascertain that but I didn't address the issue in my mind.""

59He was asked to concede whether there was a possibility that his recollection was in error. He refused to make that concession, but added ""to answer that more fully, one, of course, can't concede that one may have forgotten something one doesn't remember"" but went on to say that he retained a clear recollection of the forensic decisions which he did make at that trial. 

60It is an everyday occurrence that, during the course of a trial, particularly a lengthy trial such as this one, errors of omission occur. Trials are conducted by humans, not machines. It is not inherently implausible that, some weeks after his unsuccessful objection to the tender, Mr Kintominas forgot to remind the judge of the foreshadowed direction. The trial judge himself forgot (although his Honour was entitled to expect either or both counsel to draw the point to his attention). There was no evidence as to the state of mind of the Crown Prosecutor, but we would infer that she too omitted to remind the trial judge of what had been said on day 13. In the particular circumstances of this case, there were the facts that he was leaving on a pre-arranged vacation, and that the junior who was present for the remainder of the case had (so far as appears from the record) not been present on day 13 when the judge said a direction would be given. Mr Kintominas was a very experienced counsel, who made concessions in cross-examination freely and appropriately. We are not persuaded that his recollection in December 2013 was erroneous and that, contrary to his evidence, he had made a deliberate forensic decision not to seek the direction.

61That was the only basis on which the Crown contended that leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be refused. Having rejected the factual aspect of the Crown's first response to the appeal, and with the Crown making no submissions contrary to the appellant's submission that a direction should have been given, but instead relying on the proviso, it is appropriate that leave be granted under the rule to the extent it is necessary to do so. 

Was a guilty verdict on Count 1 inevitable?

(a) The Crown's submissions

62The Crown contends that even had the trial judge given directions proscribing propensity reasoning, in light of the abundance of other available evidence it was inevitable that Mr Mortada would have been convicted on Count 1, having regard to all the evidence which was properly admissible to establish his possession of the heroin. 

63Support for the Crown's submission that an inevitable guilty verdict is sufficient to engage the proviso may be found in English and Commonwealth decisions: see Lundy v The Queen (New Zealand) [2013] UKPC 28 at [160]-[161] and Stafford v The State [1999] 1 WLR 2026 at 2029, and there are Australian appellate decisions which may seem to proceed on the basis that there can be no substantial miscarriage of justice if the appellate court is persuaded that a guilty verdict is inevitable. But that is not the applicable test in New South Wales, as the appellant points out. As much had been recognised by Gibbs J in Quartermaine v The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 595 at 600-610 and by Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 372-373. In Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300, considering the common form criminal appeal provision prior to its amendment in 2008, the High Court said at [45] (emphasis added):

""Likewise, no single universally applicable criterion can be formulated which identifies cases in which it would be proper for an appellate court not to dismiss the appeal, even though persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt. What can be said, however, is that there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind."" 

64In Cesan v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 at [124], Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said that:

""a necessary, but not always sufficient, step to the application of the proviso is that the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the accused's guilt of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty. But the conclusion that guilt of the accused was proved to that standard does not, in every case, suffice to show that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. An example of circumstances in which consideration of what was proved at trial is not a sufficient basis for applying the proviso is provided by AK v Western Australia. In that case the relevant statute required that the trial of an accused, by judge alone, yield a reasoned decision, but there were no reasons given at the appellant's trial for the determination of the central issue tried in the case. That being so, it could not be said that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.""

65The most recent High Court decision on this point is Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59; 246 CLR 469, which turned on the amended form of the proviso in Victoria (and therefore does not automatically translate to the New South Wales Act). Nevertheless, the same point about the distinction between mere inevitability of guilty verdict and the absence of a substantial miscarriage of justice was made by French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ there at [33].
66In accordance with those principles, Bathurst CJ, with the agreement of Hidden and Button JJ, said in Giourtalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 216 at [84] (emphasis added) that:

""it is a necessary but not always a sufficient pre-condition for the operation of the proviso that the appellate court be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that evidence properly admitted at the trial proved the guilt of the accused.""

67Accordingly, we are bound to reject the Crown's submission that an inevitable guilty verdict is sufficient for the appeal to be dismissed.

(b) The defence submissions

68Mr Strickland's central submission was that the trial judge's failure to direct the jury that they could not use propensity reasoning to find Mr Mortada guilty on Count 1 meant that the appellant did not have a fair trial according to law. In his written submissions (at [111]), Mr Strickland stated:

""... a prohibited line of reasoning is, for example: 

'we are satisfied that Mr Mortada had sold heroin in the past and sent the proceeds of those heroin sales overseas and therefore he must be guilty of possessing the 496 grams of heroin in room 1417'.""

69In developing this submission, Mr Strickland's contention was that the jurors were never informed as to whether, and if so how, they could use evidence of actual supply of prohibited drugs (referred to in oral submissions as the ""uncharged offences"") - evidenced by the Post-It Notes and the Western Union money transfers - in order to prove the deemed supply count, Count 1.

70In oral submissions, Mr Strickland stated that the evidence of the ""uncharged offences"" once admitted, and in the absence of appropriate directions, could be used by the jury for two purposes, namely:

(i) as circumstantial evidence relevant to proving actual possession of the 496.75 grams found in a suitcase in Room 1417 of the Sheraton on the Park Hotel; and

(ii) as evidence on the basis of which the jury may engage in propensity reasoning to find the appellant guilty on Count 1.

71It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that in respect of the possibility of the jury using the evidence as in (ii) above, without appropriate trial directions, there existed a real risk that the jury would impermissibly use the evidence to reason to guilt.

""... His Honour's failure to direct the jury as to the use they could make of the evidence of actual supply left it open to the jury to engage in impermissible propensity reasoning"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [108].

72In oral submissions Mr Strickland stated:

""What the trial judge had to do was to acknowledge the evidence was admissible for one purpose but not another"".

73Mr Strickland further submitted:

""The failure to give this direction even though it was not asked for, meant there was not a trial according to law because these were directions that had to be given to avoid a miscarriage of justice and a failure to give such a direction meant there was a loss of a real chance of acquittal. That reasoning is adopted in the case of BRS v The Queen ..."".

74In addressing the relevant legal principles, Mr Strickland submitted that:

(i) when admitting evidence in this case, being a multiple-count case, the trial judge was required to exercise care and precision to identify precisely what issue the evidence was relevant to: DJV v R (2008) 200 A Crim R 206 at [28], [36] and [37];

(ii) the failure to identify such issues will, and did, cause problems when coming to direct the jury as to how they use that evidence: JDK v R (2009) 194 A Crim R 333 at [31] and [37];

(iii) evidence admitted for one purpose is not admissible for another purpose, that is, it cannot be used for another purpose: BRS v The Queen; and

(iv) where there is a danger or real risk that a jury may misuse evidence by engaging in inadmissible propensity reasoning, the judge should give such a warning even if trial counsel fails to request such a warning: BRS v The Queen; Giovannone (2002) 140 A Crim R 1.

75Emphasis was given in Mr Strickland's submissions to particular observations made by members of the Court in BRS v The Queen. These included the observations of McHugh J to the following effect:

(i) there is a fundamental principle of the criminal law in this country that ordinarily the guilt of an accused person is not to be ""inferred from the character and tendencies of the accused"": at 304;

(ii) if evidence revealing a criminal or reprehensible propensity is admitted, the trial judge must give the jury careful directions concerning the use which they can make of the evidence: at 305;

(iii) if the evidence is admitted for a reason other than reliance on propensity, the judge must direct the jury that they can use the evidence for the relevant purpose and for no other purpose: at 305, and

(iv) in some cases the judge may need to be more specific. He or she may need to direct the jurors that they cannot use the evidence for an identified purpose. If the evidence is admitted because the Crown wishes to rely on the accused's propensity as an element in the chain of proof, it is especially necessary that the judge give the jurors clear directions as to the manner in which they may use the propensity evidence: at 305.

76In his oral submissions, Mr Strickland submitted that:

""... the high point of our case on appeal is that there was extremely significant evidence led in this case, in Mortada's case, that show extensive criminal activity other than that charged. I particularly refer to exhibit 26 ... Exhibit 26 is a convenient list of all the Western Union money transfers. This really I submit is the high point of why the directions that I say should have been given, should have been given.

First, you will notice if you go to the last page you will see that the total amount for Western Union money transfers is close to $1 million, $945,000. You will note that the subject of count 2 was about $19,000 and the money that is subject of count 3 is about $22,000. Count 2 is found on Mortada's person. Count 3 is found in the safe in the Sheraton on the Park unit. In short, the money which is said by the Crown to be transferred pursuant to drug sales is some 25 times greater in quantity than counts 2 and 3. Secondly, your Honours will note that the range of dates of the money transfers, being 27 February 2009 through to 16 June 2009 is very extensive.""

77Mr Strickland subsequently stated:

""Your Honour the submission I make though is that the vast majority of this is uncharged acts, it has not got nothing to do with counts 1, 2 or 3. I am not saying it is not relevant to any of the counts, but there is a very significant body of uncharged acts that was used in the Crown case and that's the relevance of BRS v The Queen ..."".

78A little later, Mr Strickland submitted:

""It would have been wrong for them to do so and likewise, the jury may have reasoned that if he is the kind of person who sells - deals with the drugs, sells the proceeds - I'm sorry, and transfers the proceeds overseas to the tune of one million dollars and he is therefore the kind of person who might therefore be in control of the half a kilogram of heroin in the safe.""

79At pages 29-31 of the transcript, the issue whether the appellant was denied a real chance of acquittal and, hence a fair trial, was discussed by Mr Strickland and the members of the Bench constituting the Court. Mr Strickland contested the proposition that the appropriate approach in this case was one that focussed on all of the other circumstantial evidence that tended to establish the connection and accordingly the appellant's alleged possession of the heroin the subject of Count 1, such that one might then conclude that the failure to give the direction was of no moment. In that respect Mr Strickland argued:

""No your Honour we wouldn't adopt that line, I would not with respect, adopt that line of reasoning because in my submission, it is inconsistent with both this authority and it is also inconsistent with the notion - with this two-fold notion. The Crown as I understand it, accepts that the high point of the defence case as I've said earlier, is that there were real connections between El Dirani and the heroin 

...

[T]here were real connections, it wasn't fanciful to suggest that he was the owner of it because of the - in my submission, the very strong evidence of his connections with it 

...

[I]n my submission the proper question is this. Is there a real possibility that the jury misused the uncharged acts evidence"" (emphasis added).

80Whilst, with respect, Mr Strickland was correct in identifying that as a question that this Court must ultimately consider and determine, it is necessarily one that also requires this Court to do so having regard to the whole of the evidence directly and indirectly relevant to the issue as to whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the 496.75 grams of heroin was in the appellant's possession.

81The question when so considered ultimately is whether there was a real chance that the jury may have convicted the accused by a chain of ""forbidden reasoning"". As McHugh J made plain in BRS at 306, trial judges have no authority to dispense with the directions that the law requires them to give in criminal trials and if a failure to give a direction may have resulted in a conviction of the accused person, the trial has not been conducted according to law. In those circumstances the conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.

82However, as his Honour also observed (at 308), whilst a trial judge must give a clear direction to the jury as to the use that they can make of the evidence it does not follow that the failure to give such a direction always constitutes a miscarriage of justice. The failure may have made no difference to the outcome of the trial. The appellant's submissions were largely based on the reasons of McHugh J in BRS. It is to be noted that the penultimate sentence of those reasons is:

""Furthermore, although the appellant's chance of acquittal may have been small if a proper direction had been given, it is impossible to conclude that he must inevitably have been convicted.""

83It is therefore necessary for two reasons to examine the defence case in detail. The first is that before the proviso can be applied, it is necessary to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence properly admitted proved Mr Mortada's guilt. The second, which is closely related to the first, is that an examination of that evidence is necessary in order to determine whether there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice.

84That assessment falls to be undertaken in light of the whole of the evidence at trial, and is subject to the ""natural limitations"" inherent in an appeal: Cesan at [128], quoting Dearman v Dearman (1908) 7 CLR 549 at 561. Those natural limitations are of heightened importance in a trial such as the present, in which the Crown case was circumstantial, and when Mr Mortada gave evidence, was cross-examined extensively, and called a series of witnesses including Rabieh and Hanan. In many cases where the accused gives evidence and propounds a positive case, it will not be possible for an appellate court to conclude that a guilty verdict was inevitable: cf Cesan at [130]. Accordingly, in what follows it is essential to distinguish between evidence (such as testimonial evidence of Mr Mortada and his witnesses) which it was open to the jury to accept might give rise to a reasonable doubt, and incontrovertible documentary or telephonic or electronic evidence in respect of which this Court is in as good a position as the jury.

(c) The defence case in detail

85It is necessary to analyse the defence case at trial, insofar as it related to the first count, in detail, for as was said in Weiss at [41]:

""[t]he appellate court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the 'natural limitations' that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record, the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty.""

86The defence sought to establish a reasonable doubt that the heroin was in Mr Mortada's possession. It was said that Mr Mortada had a flight booked to return to Lebanon on the day he was arrested, that his personal belongings were at a unit in Punchbowl, where he intended to return before going to the airport, that no airline ticket was found in the hotel room, and that there were items of Mr El Dirani found in the room (including some viagra, steroids and body building magazines). There were high quality forged drivers licences in evidence, said to have been found in the suitcase obtained by the Legal Aid solicitor, including one with Mr Mortada's name and photograph; Mr Mortada said that this demonstrated that Mr El Dirani had the capacity to impersonate him. The heroin was found wrapped in a towel, which Mr Mortada claimed to be from the Hilton hotel where Mr El Dirani was staying. And it was put forcefully and lengthily at trial that there had been a series of errors by the investigating police which left room for reasonable doubt (for example, the towel had not been seized, the room had not been fingerprinted, the CCTV footage in neither hotel had been viewed before it was erased).

87Mr Mortada denied all knowledge of the money or the drugs in the hotel room. He said he stayed in the house of his friends Hanan and Rabieh in Punchbowl. Both of those friends gave evidence that Mr Mortada had stayed with them in June 2009, and indeed one of them maintained unequivocally that Mr Mortada had stayed with him every night including the week of 10-17 June 2008 (""he always came back and slept at home and I used to hear him coming because I have four kids""). Mr Mortada maintained that Mr El Dirani had impersonated him, booking the room in Mr Mortada's name and without his knowledge, in order to protect himself. His evidence was:

Q. You see are you saying that Mr El Dirani went to the Sheraton on the Park and impersonated you without your knowledge; is that what you're saying?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, of course without my knowledge. 

...

Q. So when was the first time you hear mention of the Sheraton Hotel in the course of this matter in June of 2009 or whenever it was?

A. INTERPRETER: When I got into gaol.

88The fact that his name, mobile phone number, email address and credit card were all used was explained by Mr Mortada as Mr El Dirani having done ""an excellent job"" at impersonating him. When confronted with the fact that Visa card caused a message to be sent to his (Sapphire) mobile phone on 11 June, he was asked:

Q. Didn't that kind of set some questions off in your own mind as to why you were receiving that?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, of course it made me wonder. I ask Abbas - I told Abbas that I received this message, was this amont of money. ... Because I saw this message I ask him what's this. He said to me, ""I have used this card."" 

89Mr Mortada explained that he gave the Sheraton as his address when fingerprinted because he was not good at filling out forms and he wrote down what he said the police told him he should write down. When asked why he did not write down the address in Punchbowl where he was staying, he said ""As I said to you I am not very good in filling out forms"". The balance of the items found in the Sheraton room were there, on the defence case, because ""somebody put them there as insurance to make the accused look guilty so that the real perpetrator wouldn't be uncovered"". But the defence case had to grapple in detail with how items unequivocally connected with Mr Mortada came to be there. In particular, how did the bank account statement and marriage and divorce certificates, the Western Union transfers and receipts with his fingerprints on them, and Post-It notes with identity information (including the very nine Post-It notes found on Mr Mortada in 2008) with his fingerprints on them, come to be found in the room? We deal with the various explanations given by Mr Mortada below. 

(d) Eleven implausibilities in Mr Mortada's case

90Aspects of Mr Mortada's positive case that he had not occupied, and knew nothing of, the room at the Sheraton on the Park, were implausible.

91The first was that Mr El Dirani was an extremely competent forger who used the appellant's driver's licence (or a high quality forgery) and credit card and imitated his signature on the hotel check-in documents (the handwriting expert said that he knew of only two people with such skill). 

92The second was that Mr Mortada had been told by police to write the Sheraton on his fingerprint form (something which they denied, but the scenario hypothesised by the defence was presumably that Mr El Dirani had told them that that was where the appellant was staying in order to incriminate the appellant). 

93The third was that the nine Post-It notes found on Mr Mortada by Mr Singh in October 2008 in Mr Mortada's handwriting and containing his fingerprints were in the Sheraton room in June 2009 because Mr Mortada had soiled the original piece of paper in 2008 and written out the information again and given the notes to Mr El Dirani's brother in accordance with Mr El Dirani's request.

94The fourth was that despite some of those nine Post-It notes having new names written on them some time after Mr Singh saw them, Mr El Dirani managed to avoid placing any of his fingerprints on any of them, whilst Mr Mortada's fingerprints were preserved on them. 

95We pause to note that we find those propositions (acceptance of all of which is necessary in order to hypothesise a scenario consistent with Mr Mortada's case of knowing nothing of the hotel room) highly implausible. However, this Court lacks the benefit enjoyed by the jury of seeing Mr Mortada give evidence, and even though the scenarios propounded by the defence may lack persuasion, it is a very large task for this Court to be satisfied that a guilty verdict was inevitable, especially having regard to the limitations of the record. It is necessary to be conscious of what Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said in Cesan at [130]:

""Each accused proffered an explanation of what was put against him. In transcript the explanation may lack persuasion. But whether the evidence as a whole, including what each accused said in explanation, was sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt was a question for the jury to decide having regard to more than the words that are recorded in the transcript of the proceedings.""

96Were those the only improbabilities in the reasonable doubt sought to be established by the defence, we are doubtful that a conclusion of inevitability would be open to this Court. The hurdle of inevitability is, unsurprisingly, an extremely high burden to discharge. 

97However, the improbabilities are much greater than as indicated above.

98The fifth is that it seems improbable in the extreme that a Legal Aid duty solicitor would have gone to the Sheraton without having been expressly asked by Mr Mortada to do so. The solicitor had never met Mr Mortada before. The solicitor was not interviewed in the course of the criminal investigation. He was first contacted by the Crown halfway through the course of the trial (when, it may be presumed, the nature of the defence case had become apparent). The solicitor (very understandably) had only a limited recall of the events of June 2009, but there was no suggestion, nor could there have been any suggestion, that his evidence was tainted, as is plain from his cross-examination:

""Q. And indeed before you attended court last week [on the voir dire] you had no real idea of what it was that - what evidence you could give which would be of any assistance to anybody?

A. Well, I still don't know what my evidence is of assistance to the case. I still don't know.""

99But it was proven beyond any doubt that the solicitor had appeared for the appellant immediately after his arrest, had collected a suitcase from Room 1417, and had delivered it to Rabieh and Hanan. The defence case must be that the solicitor learned of the hotel from the police (say, by seeing the charge sheet). But the appellant's case was that he was not staying in any hotel; he was staying at his friends' house in Punchbowl, and had no personal belongings to retrieve from any hotel. Mr Mortada said in chief:

""Q. Did you ever tell [the solicitor] to go to the Sheraton?

A. INTERPRETER: It was - initially it was difficult to have a conversation with him in English and besides why do I have to say to him go there, I know nothing about there.

Q. Did you ask him to go to the Sheraton?

A. INTERPRETER: In fact there was no conversation between us because I was upset and crying and I was unable to talk.""

100We struggle to reconcile the fact that the solicitor went to the Sheraton on the Park, retrieved a suitcase and delivered it to Mr Mortada's friends (who then destroyed it and its contents save for the forged driver's licences which were then deployed by the defence) with any explanation other than the solicitor receiving instructions from Mr Mortada to do so. As the solicitor said in cross-examination, ""I just cannot imagine going to the hotel to pick up someone's items without some authority"" (he was referring there to written authority); that evidence is inherently plausible. 

101The explanation given in the closing address by the defence was that this was an example of a duty solicitor ""trying to be a helpful solicitor hoping to pick up a client"". We can readily accept that a solicitor may be helpful and try to assist a client, but it does not explain how he came to the belief that his instructions led him to go to the Sheraton on the Park, if at all times Mr Mortada believed that he had nothing there and indeed all of his personal belongings were already in the house of his friends Rabieh and Hanan. Solicitors do not go to hotels to reclaim the personal belongings of their (brand new) client without instructions to do so. We think the possibilities of a misunderstanding are minimal, especially if, as the solicitor (not implausibly) recalled, he had the written authority of his client to show the hotel staff, which explains why the belongings were given to him. 

102However, once again, it is necessary to be conscious of the limitations of the appellate record. The written authority which the solicitor recalled he had received was not tendered. Moreover the Crown did not rely strongly on the solicitor's evidence at trial (in final address, the prosecutor said ""[b]ut no, the Crown doesn't put him forward as strongly ... I didn't include [the solicitor] as one of the Crown's star points because there are shortcomings in [him]""). That reticence suggests that there were aspects of his evidence, not evident from the written record, which diminished the probative value of his evidence. Accordingly, we do not consider that it would be proper for this Court to regard the solicitor's testimony as clinching evidence of an association between Mr Mortada and the Sheraton on the Park room.

103Sixthly, there are the driver's licences, which were regarded by the Crown as the first of ""four particularly strong points"" in the Crown case. It was common ground that the licences were very good forgeries. They were deployed in quite different ways. The defence said that they suggested that Mr El Dirani was very well placed to impersonate the accused. The Crown said that they reflected something much more sinister. One of the forged gold driver's licences had a fee of $153, but there was uncontroverted evidence that the fee in 2009 was $151, and had been increased to $153 only from 1 July 2010. The Crown said that this demonstrated that the forgeries had been manufactured sometime in the 13 months between Mr Mortada's arrest and his release on bail, and could not have been in the suitcase in June 2009. In response, Mr Kintominas said:

""Is it really all that farfetched to consider that whichever crook it was that was operating this crooked machine making the fake licences ... made a mistake and made instead of 151 made it 153 ... ?""

104The seventh improbability is the lithium carbonate medication said to have been found in the hotel room. The same medication was found on Mr Mortada in October 2008 when searched by Mr Singh. The appellant gave evidence that, at the ""end of 2008"", he was prescribed a six month supply of Lithium, but that he stopped taking it after one month. Whether or not that was so, there is no explanation for Mr El Dirani being in possession of the same medication. However, the medication was not listed on the Property Seizure Exhibit Form (Exhibit 5), which introduces an element of doubt.

105The eighth improbability turns on timing. Mr Mortada's personal papers were found in the hotel room, including the bank statement with transactions up to 29 May 2009 in the name of him and his former wife, as well as the translations of his marriage and divorce certificates. It will be recalled that Mr Mortada's explanation was that he gave those papers to Mr El Dirani because he had kept them in a pocket in his keyboard bag, but gave them to Mr El Dirani on the weekend before they left while performing at a function so that they could be kept safe (""usually when we go to functions to perform we keep the bags outside so that means anyone can have access to them""). He gave this evidence:

""Q. Did you ask Abbas to give them back to you?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, of course.

Q. How was it that you didn't get them back?

A. INTERPRETER: It happened the last two days it was Saturday and Sunday and I ask him on Monday and Tuesday to give them back to me and it didn't occur.

Q. And you didn't chase it up after that?

A. INTERPRETER: How can I chase him up, they arrested me, it was Wednesday.""

106Mr Mortada's flight was scheduled to depart from Sydney at 2pm on Wednesday 17 June. The uncontradicted testimonial evidence was that he was detained by police late in the morning, and as noted above the mobile phone records demonstrate that the police intervened no later than 10:57am. 

107Mr Mortada's case was that his personal documents were important to him, so much so that he asked Mr El Dirani to keep them. Yet within three hours of his international flight's scheduled departure, he had not got them back. And within those three hours, according to him, he had to get from the CBD to Punchbowl to pick up his personal belongings, he also needed to visit a St George Bank to deposit a large amount of cash, and he then had to get to the airport and clear security and customs. (He said he could do so in the time available, and in any event he had a flexible business class ticket.)

108The ninth improbability with Mr Mortada's case turns upon the mobile phone stations that received calls from one of the mobile phones in his possession on 18 June 2009 (this was a Nokia 6300, with a Vodafone SIM card and contract, in the name of Mr Lewis Trev, which Mr Mortada said that Mr El Dirani had bought for him). The Crown called evidence from an analyst at Vodafone that a carrier's towers tended to transmit signals to a handset depending on their proximity, although there were other factors in play (notably, the available capacity of nearby stations). Although it was ""possible but not likely"" that a tower in Kings Cross could transmit to a handset in the CBD (because there were so many towers closer to the handset in the CBD), she excluded the possibility of a tower in Burwood doing so.

109The Crown tendered Vodafone's records of the towers used for calls and text messages made by this handset. For example, three calls were made between 12.30am and 1am on 13 June 2009; all were picked up by Vodafone's mobile phone tower described as ""Elizabeth/Park-Market"". On the morning of his arrest, two phone calls were made to Mr El Dirani at 10.18, one picked up by the same station and one at ""East Sydney"". A further two calls to Mr El Dirani at 10.37 were picked up by ""George/Park-Market"". The Crown said that this was consistent with Mr Mortada making calls from his hotel room in the Sheraton on the Park in the early hours of 13 June, and immediately before meeting Mr El Dirani on 18 June. The Crown further said that the explanation for a different Vodafone station picking up Mr Mortada's calls on the morning of 18 June 2009 was simply that he was walking from the Sheraton to the Hilton, making calls as he went. Mr Mortada said that the calls were made as he was approaching the Hilton hotel, but he denied he had been coming from the Sheraton on the Park.

110It may be acknowledged that inferences from the particular Vodafone station in the CBD which picked up Mr Mortada's handset is far from unequivocal. However, Vodafone's records did undermine the evidence of Mr Mortada's witnesses Hanan and especially Rabieh, who swore that he had stayed each night at Punchbowl in their home. The Vodafone records repeatedly located Mr Mortada in the vicinity of the Sheraton in the early hours of the morning. He made three calls between midnight and 1.00am on 13 June, two calls between 4.00 and 4.30 am on 14 June followed by one at 9.21am later that morning, and then at 2.26am and 8.26am on 15 June, all of which were picked up by the ""Elizabeth/Park-Market"" or ""East Sydney"" mobile phone towers.

111The tenth improbability arises from the fact that Mr Mortada was not wholly unaware of the Sheraton booking. He received a message saying that $1,795 had been processed on his card for the Sheraton on the Park. He accepted that he asked Mr El Dirani about it, and he was told by Mr El Dirani that he had used his card. It is very difficult to reconcile Mr Mortada's ignorance of the Sheraton on the Park with that text message. The phone recorded the message as having been read, and Mr Mortada is a man who constantly sent and received text messages.

112The eleventh improbability emerges from a close analysis of the Western Union transfer forms and Post-It notes, and the transfers of money they record, and the fingerprints they contain. This analysis in no way involves propensity reasoning. Its point is to answer two simple questions: how if Mr Mortada was not occupying Room 1417 did documents relating to transfers of money closely associated with Mr Mortada come to be in that room, and how did his fingerprints come to be on those documents in that room? 

113Sixty seven ""graphs"" were identified on the Western Union transfer forms with receipts attached located in the Sheraton on the Park hotel room when the search warrant was executed. These were labelled by the fingerprint expert as F29-F95. Some graphs contained more than one fingerprint (for example, F29 was identified as the Right Index Finger and Right Thumb prints of Mr Mortada). Sometimes, more than one graph was found on the same document (for example, the graphs identified as F29, F30 and F31 were all on a single transfer form for a transfer of $7000). 

114In all, fingerprints were found on 33 Western Union transfer forms. Of those 33, there were 30 which contained Mr Mortada's fingerprints, and none which contained Mr El Dirani's. (There were three prints (F58, F85 and F87) which were the only fingerprints on a form, and which were not identified as Mr Mortada's fingerprints.)

115Now Mr Mortada's case was that he had been asked to give the Western Union transfer forms to Mr El Dirani by his brother Ahmad. He was unable to say when that occurred. 

116But the transfers were dated fairly evenly throughout Mr Mortada's stay in Australia. Just counting the number of separate transfers each day, there were: 





21 May

6


22 May

6


23 May

4


25 May

8


27 May

5


28 May

5


29 May

6


1 June

9


2 June

5


3 June

5


4 June

5


5 June

3


6 June

3


7 June

6


9 June

6


10 June

6


11 June

9


12 June

7


13 June

7


15 June

7


16 June

1

117It follows that either Mr Mortada gave the whole bundle of transfers and receipts to Mr El Dirani shortly before his arrest on 17 June, or else Mr Mortada gave some of the bundle to him earlier, and Mr El Dirani obtained the more recent documents at some later stage. That suggests it may be of assistance to identify which receipts contained Mr Mortada's fingerprints.

118The materials reproduced in the appeal books do not permit a definitive conclusion as to the dates of the 30 Western Union transfers with Mr Mortada's fingerprints on them amongst the 119 transfers and receipts brought into existence in May and June 2009. (This is because those identified by the fingerprinting expert were described by reference to their amount and a number handwritten on the back of each transfer by the police when the search warrant was executed. There are many instances when the same amount was sent from Punchbowl Post Office to different people on different occasions, and the appeal books do not reproduce any of the backs of the transfers where the numbers written by the police were recorded.) But even so, the limited selection of evidence available at trial enables some precision, by the following two modes of reasoning, as follows:

119First, some transfers were for unique amounts of money. These were:





Amount

Date

Time

Transferee (ID) to Transferor (location)


$4989.59

23 May

14.54

Mouna Kasif (Lebanese Passport 16092013) to Ziade Hamdar (Lebanon)


$6950

27 May

15.43

Hussein Delbani (Licence NSW 18379012) to Ala Salman (unknown)


$2150

29 May

15.01

Maryan Aldirani (Licence NSW 1469034) to Ali Aldirani (Lebanon)


$7600

1 June

12.17

Naser Mounir (Licence NSW 80367hr) to Adham Boukarom (unknown)

Mr Mortada's fingerprints were on each of these transfers.

120Secondly, there were precisely four transfers of $7000 in all of the Western Union receipts tested:





Date

Time

Transferee (ID) to transferor (location)


21 May

14.23

George Nasif [Lebanese Passport 11052010] to Mouhmed Baker Elhoussiny (Lebanon)


22 May

15.18

Issam Moura [Licence NSW 1970241] to Ali Raad (Lebanon)


25 May

14.50

Jihan Maezir [Lebanese Passport rl803917] to Samir Kobeissy (Lebanon)


5 June

16.00

Imad Asmar [Passport Aland Is 73041] to Honan Yamoul (unknown)

As it happens, all four $7,000 transfers and receipts were tested for fingerprints, and all four contained Mr Mortada's fingerprints. 

121There are in that manner, based only on the (limited) materials in the appellate record, identified eight Western Union transfers and receipts, dated 21, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 29 May and 1 and 5 June, found in the Sheraton on the Park safe with Mr Mortada's fingerprints on them. 

122The next aspect of this improbability arises from an analysis of the Post-It notes (many of which, once again, contained Mr Mortada's fingerprints but not a single fingerprint of Mr El Dirani). For example, one of the Post-it notes which had been in Mr Mortada's possession in 2008 commenced with ""From: Raide Asaad"", gave a date of birth, driver's licence number and address and telephone number, and concluded ""To: Dina Hamada"". Another commenced with ""From: Karie Mandin"", gave a date of birth, driver's licence and address and telephone number, and concluded ""To: Imad Chaaban"". Both those documents were found in the safe in June 2009. The former had not been altered. The latter had ""Imad Chaaban"" crossed out and replaced by ""Mona Eldoker"". The former bore Mr Mortada's left thumb print, the latter bore his left ring and left middle finger prints. Neither had Mr El Dirani's prints. 

123Of course, a fingerprint is not left every time a document is handled, but it is inherently improbable that so many fingerprints have been retained of the man who had merely been asked to hand the documents to Mr El Dirani, and none of the man who (on the defence case) held the documents (in the case of the Post-It notes, for nine months) and indeed wrote on them. If Mr Mortada is to be believed, he merely took the transfers and receipts from Mr Ahmad El Dirani and handed them to Mr El Dirani. That said, it is conceivable that Mr El Dirani might have been aware that he had incriminating documents with Mr Mortada's fingerprints on them, and was very careful not to leave any of his own on them.

124It is also useful to consider the substance of the Western Union transfer forms and receipts, as opposed to the fingerprints on them. One of those forms found in the Sheraton on the Park room was a transfer made on the previous Friday afternoon 12 June 2009, of funds seemingly to Mr Mortada's former wife, using the name of one of the people Mr Mortada had been staying with. It was in the amount of $9440, purportedly sent by ""Hanan Moussa"" who provided a driver's licence and sent funds to Manal El Dirani. Almost uniquely, the transfer was made at Roselands, rather than Punchbowl Post Office. Almost uniquely, the driver's licence number matched that of the sender according to agency records.

125Ms Hanan Moussa was one of the friends with whom Mr Mortada had been staying in 2009 (and he was living with them while on bail during the trial). She knew Manal as a ""family friend"". She was called by the defence, and she was cross-examined about the transfer. She denied sending the money.

126How precisely that money was sent (whether it was sent by Ms Moussa, or by someone impersonating her) does not matter. What does matter is that the sender is identified as one of the friends with whom he was staying, and the recipient is identified as his former wife (and mother of his children), and it is dated 12 June 2009. It powerfully connects Mr Mortada with a document brought into existence on the Friday afternoon before his arrest the following Wednesday, which was found in the hotel room. 

127That evidence must be considered as a whole. This is, in truth, a case where the Crown's circumstantial case was overwhelming. The difficulty in hypothesising facts consistent with innocence is in truth greater than has been set out above but the foregoing matters focus on the critical issue of fact: had the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the heroin was in the possession of Mr Mortada and excluded the possibility that it was in the possession of Mr El Dirani? The Crown did so by an overwhelming circumstantial case. As McHugh J observed in Shepherd v The Queen (1991) 170 CLR 573 at 593: 

""In a particular case, an inference of guilt beyond reasonable doubt may not be able to be drawn unless each fact relied on to found the inference is established beyond reasonable doubt. This is likely to be the case where the incriminating facts relied on to establish the inference are few in number. But the more facts that are relied on to found the inference of guilt, the less likely it is that each or any fact will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, even when guilt beyond reasonable doubt cannot be inferred unless certain facts are proved, it may still be open to infer guilt beyond reasonable doubt even though each fact is not proved to that standard.""

128Notwithstanding the failure to give a propensity direction, Mr Mortada's conviction was inevitable, given the evidence properly admitted which did prove his offence beyond reasonable doubt. There comes a time when the combination of implausibilities and improbabilities precludes there being a reasonable doubt of guilt; this is the cumulative elimination of other possibilities by geometric progression invoked by Lord Simon of Glaisdale in Reg v Kilbourne [1973] AC 729 at 758, to which McHugh J referred in Shepherd at 592-593. The same point was made by Dawson J (with whom Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) when he referred at 580 to the probative force of a mass of evidence being cumulative. Indeed, it is no different from what Lord Cairns long ago said in Belhaven and Stenton Peerage (1875) 1 AC 278 at 279:

""Mr Lords, in dealing with circumstantial evidence, we have to consider the weight that is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together. You may have a ray of light so feeble that by itself it will do little to elucidate a dark corner. But on the other hand, you may have a number of rays, each of them insufficient, but all converging and brought to bear upon the same point, and, when united, producing a body of illumination which will clear away the darkness which you are endeavouring to dispel.""

129Those principles apply when circumstantial evidence is relied upon in a criminal trial. The authorities were reviewed by Giles JA, with whom Howie and Buddin JJ agreed, in Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193 at [55]-[65] and in the joint judgment of McClellan CJ at CL, Fullerton and Garling JJ in Gilham v R [2012] NSWCCA 131 at [466].

130In this appeal, guilt is the only rational inference that can be drawn from the matters referred to above when they are reviewed in their totality. We should not be taken as saying that all of the implausibilities and improbabilities referred to above were necessary in order to compel an inference of guilt. To the contrary, this is a case when, even allowing for the limitations of the appellate record, there is a superabundance of evidence which is more than sufficient to exclude reasonable doubt of innocence. The circumstantial case is accurately described as ""overwhelming"". 

(e) The N95 found in the hotel room was used by Mr Mortada in May 2009

131There is a further matter distinct from the foregoing: the presence of the Nokia N95 phone in the safe in Room 1417, and the electronic communications recorded in it and tendered at the trial. Mr Mortada and Mr El Dirani had more mobile phones in their actual possession than most people; a natural question was whether the handset found in the safe was connected with Mr Mortada.

132Mr Mortada accepted that the Nokia N95 had been in his possession at least until, as he said, it was given by him to Mr El Dirani in Africa in March 2009. Mr Mortada was bound to accept that because of the pictures and text messages contained in it when it was examined after having been found in the safe with the heroin. The text messages were of a personal nature from Mr Mortada's girlfriend in 2008 and early 2009. There was no dispute that she had then used a mobile phone number which ended in 4456, and the N95 recorded messages received from that number including ""This is how I wanna look in your dreams"" (22 February 2009) and ""And you love manal more than me ..."" (11 October 2008) and ""You can't talk to me? You switch off your phone? Too busy with manal to talk to your girlfriend?"" (12 October 2008). (""Manal"" is a reference to the appellant's former wife.) 

133Mr Mortada's response was to claim that he gave the N95 to Mr El Dirani in March 2009 and never saw it subsequently. His counsel opened his case as follows:

""It will, however, be the accused's evidence that he gave that phone to Mr El Dirani and I will be directing the jury's attention to the use of that phone during the period that my client was in Australia, because the defence says the issue will be who had that phone in Australia.""

134Mr Mortada's evidence matched his counsel's opening. He said:

""Q. [W]hen did you last see that phone?

...

A. INTERPRETER: The last time I saw it was in Africa.

Q. When was this African trip?

A. INTERPRETER: In March 2009.

...

Q. You say that you last saw it sometime in March in Africa 2009, in what circumstances did you last see the phone?

A. INTERPRETER: The telephone was with me. I took it with me to Africa with Abbas El Dirani and we had another guy also called Hussein El Dirani. When we arrived there they did not have telephones on them. They said that they ... didn't want to take telephones with them, they want to have a break on the basis that it was a holiday. When we got there I - Abbas asked me for the telephone. He wanted to use it. I said here's the telephone. ... After, you know, I gave it to him and then when he wanted to return it to me I said no keep it and what I mean after that I don't know what happened to it"". 

135However, other messages sent from that handset suggest that Mr Mortada used it when he arrived in Sydney. To explain this, it is necessary to descend to the details of the evidence.

136Most of the text messages retained in the handset had been received by (rather than sent from) the phone. However, there were five outgoing text messages in its memory. Two had been sent on 20 May 2009, to a phone whose number ended in 5527. The first message was ""Wainak?""; the second was ""W r u man?""

137It will be recalled that Mr Mortada and Mr El Dirani arrived in Sydney on 20 May 2009. On that day, seven text messages were sent from Mr Mortada's Sapphire phone to the same phone number (which ended in 5527). The content of the first was masked at trial and in the appeal books, but the following six were as follows (the row numbers of the print-out on which they appeared in the evidence are also given in order to understand the cross-examination on them):

236 ""Wainak""

237 ""Wainak wloh""

238 ""Yes bas wainak?""

239 ""Wainak loh""

240 ""Abas w r u ?""

241 ""Go to number 4 you get th bagge"" [sic].

138Mr Mortada accepted that the Sapphire phone was in his possession, in Lebanon and in Australia. He gave evidence about these messages. He had previously accepted (readily) that the 5527 number was that of Mr El Dirani (""See the number there, xxxxxx 5527, that's Mr Abbas El Dirani's number isn't it - Yes, correct""). He gave this evidence:

""Q. If I can ask you just to go down a couple of entries, 236. Do you see the mobile phone number ending in 55527?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. And that's a message that you sent to Abbas El Dirani, isn't it?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. So we can accept that the number ending in 55527 is Abbas El Dirani's number?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. And that message is a word in Arabic ... and that word ""wainak"" means where are you, do you agree with that translation?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes.

Q. So the next message also sent to Abbas some two minutes after, you ask him against ""Wainak wloh"", do you agree with that?

A. INTERPRETER: Wainak Wloh, it's not wloh.

Q. Sorry, my pronunciation is pretty bad in Arabic. Well what does it mean?

A. INTERPRETER: It's a Bedouin language which we use when - shepherds use when they speak to their goats, they say wloh. ... When the sheep go away, you know they call them ""wloh wloh"", so they can come back.

Q. OKAY. So you were effectively asking Mr Abbas where he was at that time in that message, do you agree with that?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, I was asking him where he is, where he was.

...

Q. The next two messages, 239 and 240, you are asking Abbas where he is, do you agree with that?

A. INTERPRETER: Yes, one of them Wainak wloh and the other one is Abbas where are you.

Q. Was this because you got separated when you arrived at Sydney Airport?

A. INTERPRETER: We did not separate when we arrived to Sydney, but as we were entering Australia the Customs - Customs stopped Abbas and I continued my way out.""

139There is one highly plausible explanation for the two messages sent from the N95 phone on 20 May 2009 to the 5527 number ""Wainak?"" and ""W r u man?"". It is clear that those two messages were not sent by Mr El Dirani, for they are sent to the same number ending in 5527 that Mr Mortada had been sending text messages to using his Sapphire phone on the same day. The evidence does not suggest that there was anyone else who could have been sending text messages on that day of that nature to Mr El Dirani. It is plausible that Mr Mortada, trying to locate Mr El Dirani after they were separated on arrival on 20 May 2009, sent at least eight text messages, mostly from his Sapphire phone, but also two from the N95 phone. The coincidence of the timing, the phone number, and the substantially identical language exclude any other non-fanciful possibility. If so, it is inconsistent with Mr Mortada's explanation that he handed over the phone to Mr El Dirani in Africa and did not know what happened to it thereafter. 

140However, this was not a matter with which Mr Mortada was confronted in cross-examination at the trial. Nor was it the subject of the written or oral submissions when the appeal was heard. Accordingly, parties were, by letters dated 19 and 26 February 2014, directed to the evidence and the fact that it appeared that Mr Mortada sent the two messages on 20 May 2009 from the N95 handset, and invited to make submissions if they wished. An extension of time to do so was granted at the request of Mr Mortada. 

141A submission was received from Mr Mortada's counsel (on 5 March 2014, within the time permitted), to the effect that the Court should not draw the inference, essentially for two reasons. The first was that the common nature of the request and common usage of the words used by any Arabic speaking person did not prove that the same person must have sent the message. That submission would have force if all that had been sent were the messages ""W r u"" or ""Where are you"". It might even have force if the message was just ""Wainak?"" (although there was no evidence as to whether that term was commonly used by Arabic speakers). However, the evidence is much more powerful. The messages are not merely to the same effect. Mr Mortada used the Sapphire handset to transmit the English acronym ""W r u"" and the Arabic term ""Wainak"" interchangeably when trying to locate Mr El Dirani. The person who used the N95 likewise used both the acronym and the Arabic term. Nor is it merely similarity of language. The messages were sent on the same day, to the same phone number ending in 5527 which Mr Mortada readily accepted was Mr El Dirani's phone. 

142The second reason advanced by Mr Mortada was that this had not been put to him at trial, so that he had not been given any opportunity to proffer an explanation for the coincidence. The Crown submitted that only if no other rational inference could be drawn in the circumstances could use fairly be made of this material. We do not need to, and do not, express a view whether that submission, applied to the facts of this appeal, is correct, in light of the fact that reliance on the messages sent on 20 May 2009 would amount to a rejection of an aspect of Mr Mortada's sworn evidence, which in fairness to Mr Mortada should have been put squarely to him if it is to be relied upon: see (in a civil context) Kuhl v Zurich Financial Services Australia Ltd [2011] HCA 11; 243 CLR 361 at [70]-[74].

143The evidence did, however, support the Crown's circumstantial case. Our conclusion does not rest on this evidence, but we have referred to it in order to explain how we have approached the parties' submissions on the matter which we raised with them. 

(f) Conclusion: a guilty verdict was inevitable

144The Crown case connecting Mr Mortada to Room 1417 may accurately be described as overwhelming. Its essence is this. Room 1417 was booked in Mr Mortada's name, his signature was on the hotel registration form, his credit card was used for pre-authorisation, and his phone contained a text message referring to it which he received, and he was repeatedly in its vicinity making phone calls at night. Room 1417 was found to contain documents belonging to Mr Mortada, Post-It notes with his fingerprints on them, Western Union transfers and receipts which had his fingerprints on them and which were connected with him, and medicine with which he had been prescribed. When Mr Mortada was arrested, he gave the Sheraton on the Park as his address, and a duty solicitor went to Room 1417 and collected a suitcase and gave it to his friends (who destroyed it), save for forged driver's licences which recorded fees inconsistent with their being in existence in June 2009. 

145Mr Mortada sought elaborately to deny all knowledge of the room at the Sheraton on the Park. He claimed he had been set up by Mr El Dirani and his associates. But the extended series of improbabilities entailed by his explanation mean that it was not open to the jury to accept that Mr Mortada was unaware of the Sheraton in the Park room. The only alternative on the evidence was that Mr Mortada had occupied the room, and was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr El Dirani. It followed that he was in possession of the heroin.

Was there a substantial miscarriage of justice?

146From time to time the appellant and the Crown, orally and in writing, submitted that the failure to give the direction in relation to propensity reasoning meant that Mr Mortada had ""lost a real chance of acquittal"". That language may be convenient, but it is not the statutory test, and care must be taken if departing from the statutory language: see Weiss at [40], Cesan at [123] and Versi v R [2013] NSWCCA 206 at [140] (Adams J, Basten JA and Latham J agreeing). 

147Moreover, contrary to the Crown submission, the fact that the incontrovertible evidence makes a guilty verdict inevitable is not sufficient, although it is highly relevant to the remaining question, which is that posed by the statute: did no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occur? 

148As noted in Wilde at 373 and Weiss at [45], there is ""no rigid formula"" and ""no single universally applicable criterion"" specifying the circumstances when an appellate court can be satisfied that a guilty verdict was inevitable on the evidence, notwithstanding an error in the course of the trial, but even so it is not satisfied there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice. In Cesan at [81], French CJ said:

""There may be cases, nevertheless, in which there is a process failure of such significance that, whatever the apparent weight of the evidence against the accused person, it cannot be said that there has not been a substantial miscarriage of justice.""

149This was not such a case. Having regard to the course taken at trial, it is clear that the error was not ""a serious departure from the essential requirements of the law"", to use the language approved by Gibbs J in Quartermaine at 601. It was not ""radical or fundamental"", to use the language of Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Wilde at 373. There was no ""process failure"" in the sense to which French CJ referred in Cesan (at [4]), involving a trial which was ""flawed in a fundamental respect"" (by reason of the judge being asleep repeatedly during the trial). 

150Three considerations make this clear. First, much of the evidence linking Mr Mortada to uncharged criminality was tendered without objection. Objection was only made, relatively late in the course of the Crown case, when the evidence of Mr Singh was sought to be tendered. At that time, as is recorded in his Honour's judgment, the Post-It notes in the safe were already before the jury (they were Exhibit 19). So too were the Western Union transfer forms and receipts with some of the same information. And evidence had been served and the case opened to the effect that the handwriting and fingerprints on the Post-It notes in the room were those of Mr Mortada. It was at that point that it was decided that a propensity direction would be given. 

151Secondly, neither of the experienced counsel saw the need, by the end of the trial, for a propensity direction earlier dealt with to be given, the form of the jury directions having then been discussed at length. 

152Thirdly, there is force in the Crown submission that this was consistent with an essential aspect of the defence case by which the jury was invited to conclude that Mr El Dirani was deeply involved in the sale of illegal drugs. For example, in closing address, Mr Kintominas said ""If you have a look at Mr El Dirani's phone messages the defence says it's very clear that he is involved in selling and buying drugs"". 

153Although we have not been satisfied that Mr Kintominas deliberately refrained from reminding the trial judge of the propensity direction promised on day 13 of the trial, the fact that he was inviting the jury to hold that the Crown had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt by inviting propensity reasoning directed to Mr El Dirani, based on the very same documents (the Post-It notes and Western Union transfers and receipts which the appellant said he had given to Mr El Dirani), confirms that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice by the failure to give a propensity direction (cf BRS at 307).

Conclusion

154For those reasons, we conclude that a guilty verdict was inevitable and are satisfied that the failure to give the direction (which had been indicated by the judge but was not subsequently raised by the appellant or by the Crown) did not give rise to any substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurring. Accordingly, the Court's orders will be: 

(1) Extension of time to appeal granted.
(2) Leave under Rule 4 granted.
(3) Appeal dismissed. 

155There are two final matters. The first is that it is unnecessary to explore the consequences of the inconsistency with the unchallenged guilty verdict in relation to the third count (the money found in the safe in the hotel room), which would have flowed from an acceptance of the appellant's argument. No submissions were addressed to this question. However, it would seem to have been at the least desirable, in order to avoid the prospect of inconsistent verdicts, for the appeal to have extended to the conviction on the third count, even though Mr Mortada had already served the entire sentence. 

156The second is that it is a large thing for the Crown not to dispute that a non-trivial error has occurred in the trial of a serious criminal offence lasting six weeks, but to rely on the proviso and thereby require this Court to review for itself the entirety of the evidence with a view to concluding that a guilty verdict was inevitable and no miscarriage of justice has occurred. It is important for the person convicted at such a trial, as well as for the efficient operation of the Court, and the avoidance of a needless retrial in the limited circumstances where the proviso operates, that the Crown provide detailed and substantial assistance in explaining why a guilty verdict was inevitable and how that conclusion can safely be reached, notwithstanding the natural limitations of appellate review. The Court is grateful for the considerable assistance received, but in the particular facts of this trial, a greater level of assistance with the detail of the evidence on which the Crown's circumstantial case rested would have been welcomed.

		24 March 2014",2014-03-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763549,R v Aller [2014] NSWSC 360,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Michael John Aller is charged with one count of murder, contrary to s 18(i)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, in relation to the death of Amy Aiton on 31 July 2012 at Narara. 
2Mr Aller was committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales by the Local Court of New South Wales.  On 7 March 2014, Johnson J determined, pursuant to s 8 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Forensic Provisions Act""), that an inquiry should be conducted as to the question of Mr Aller's unfitness to be tried for the offence of murder.  Mr Aller has not been arraigned. 
3I have today conducted an inquiry pursuant to the provisions of Pt 2 of the Forensic Provisions Act as to whether Mr Aller is unfit to be tried for the offence of murder.  
Applicable Legal Principles
4There are a number of general principles of law that are relevant to this inquiry. 
5The first is that the question of unfitness of Mr Aller to be tried is to be determined on the balance of probabilities: s 6 of the Forensic Provisions Act. 
6The second is that the inquiry is not to be conducted, and it has not been conducted, in an adversarial manner: s 12(2) of the Forensic Provisions Act. 
7The final general principle is that there is no onus of proof resting on either the Crown or Mr Aller: s 12(3) of the Forensic Provisions Act. 
8In giving this judgment and making any determination on the inquiry, I am required to identify the principles of law which I apply, and the findings of fact which I am satisfied should be made: s 11(2) of the Forensic Provisions Act. 
9I commence with an identification of the substantive principles of law relevant to the issue of whether a person is, or is not, fit to stand trial.  The principles are of longstanding, and can be found in the decision of The Queen v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48 per Smith J and in the decision of the High Court of Australia in Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 246 per Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.  The principles are designed, or intended, to give effect to the guarantee of the common law that any person accused of a crime is entitled to a fair trial according to law.  A fair trial according to law is a fundamental precept of the criminal justice system. 
10One aspect of that guarantee is that if a criminal trial cannot fairly proceed when an accused is not fit to plead to stand trial, then such a trial ought not proceed.  
11I will try and summarise the principles of law about whether Mr Aller is or is not fit to stand trial.  I do so, in order that the findings of fact in my determination are more readily understood. 
12The consideration of these principles must take place in the context of the length and complexity of the particular trial proceedings.  Here, any trial is likely to last for at least two weeks.  The criteria for fitness to be tried, which are minimum standards, are that an accused such as Mr Aller, must be able to:
(a)understand what he has been charged with; 
(b)enter a plea to the charge; 
(c)exercise his right to challenge any juror; 
(d)understand generally the nature of the proceedings, so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, namely, that it is an inquiry by a judge and jury as to whether he did commit the offence with which he is charged;
(e)follow the course of the proceedings, so as to understand what is happening without the necessity to understand all of the various aspects of court formality;
(f)to understand the substantial effect of any evidence which may be given against him in support of the prosecution; and, 
(g)to give his counsel instructions, including his version of the facts, which are sufficient to make his defence and answer the charge. 
See Presser at 48, Kesavarajah at 246, R v Robinson [2008] NSWCCA 64 at [65]-[66].
Evidence
13In this inquiry, under the Forensic Provisions Act, I have available to me the following material.  Firstly, a statement of the Crown case, which sets out the facts which, it is accepted, the Crown can prove at a trial. 
14Secondly, two reports of an expert psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 4 September 2013 and 28 February 2014, and lastly, the expert evidence of Dr Richard Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, set out in his reports dated 8 November 2013 and 18 February 2014. 
Proved Facts
15According to the Crown Case Statement, in the weeks before Ms Aiton was killed, the accused, Mr Aller, was staying with her in her townhouse.  It is apparent that they had met only some weeks before her death, and had shortly after meeting commenced an intimate relationship. 
16The accused had been attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, and had met the deceased, Ms Aiton, with the assistance of a man he had met there. 
17At about 9.30am on 1 August 2012, the accused rang his mother and asked her to do him a very big favour.  He said to her, ""[d]o you have the address here?""  His mother said ""Yes"".  The accused then said to his mother, ""[c]ould you ring the police, to come to the unit, as I have just stabbed Amy to death"".  He then hung up, and could not be contacted. 
18It appears that the accused then left those premises because, at about 2pm on that day, he approached uniformed police officers at Central Railway Station and said that he needed to speak with someone because he was wanted for the murder of his girlfriend.  The accused was interviewed, and shortly, was charged.  He has been in custody ever since. 
19It is clear that the attack on Ms Aiton was of a violent nature, requiring someone to use significant force to inflict the various wounds from which she died. 
Expert Evidence
20The first report of Dr Richard Furst, dated 8 November 2013, records the result of a lengthy conference that he had in 2013 with Mr Aller.  He had previously consulted Mr Aller, and he was asked to provide an updated opinion.  At the time that Dr Furst consulted with Mr Aller, it is clear that Mr Aller was suffering from symptoms of a florid mental illness.  He was medicated with a series of prescription drugs, directed to controlling and mitigating the effects of his mental illness. 
21Dr Furst expressed this view about Mr Aller in 2013, which I accept.  He said:
""His concentration is likely to be impaired by his auditory hallucinations and current mood disturbance.  He is likely to struggle to endure a trial in his current condition.  
His overall understanding of his legal situation and capacity to participate in a trial has deteriorated over recent weeks, with symptoms of acute depression and persistent auditory hallucinations.  His capacity to follow the proceedings and give logical instructions and/or understand legal advice given to him is now impaired.  He would be a vulnerable witness.  He may also enter a plea without sufficient understanding or consideration of the legal implications, either in response to auditory hallucinations or feelings of nihilism/guilt.  He lacks endurance.
Having regard to the standards of R v Presser and Kesavarajah, I am now of the opinion that Mr Aller is currently unfit to be tried or enter a plea.  He may well improve to the point that he becomes fit to be tried over the next 12 months, depending on his response to treatment."" 
22Dr Furst went on to recommend consideration of a trial of further medication to assist with Mr Aller's mental illness. 
23Dr Furst consulted with Mr Aller again in 18 February 2014.  He conducted a mental state examination of Mr Aller, and reviewed various contemporaneous, relevant documents, including Justice Health medical records.  Dr Furst expressed this conclusion, which I also accept:
""Mr Aller remains psychotic, attempted to kill himself again in December, is paranoid, experiences auditory hallucinations, and is very impaired by virtue of his psychosis.  A criminal trial would be an additional stressor, especially given his preoccupation with 'evil' and irrational patterns of thinking.  
He remains at high risk of self-harm and of dying in custody by virtue of his treatment resistant mental illness and suicide risk.  His discharge from the Long Bay Hospital may well have been premature, especially considering his symptoms and signs of mental illness, risk profile and lack of response to his current treatment.  In my opinion, he continues to be a mentally ill person, particularly with regard to his continuing condition, psychotic symptoms and multiple suicide attempts.  
His paranoid interpretations of staff and legal participants in Court, will prevent him from deciding on his plea in a rational manner, giving proper instructions, understanding proceedings, making out his defence, and enduring a trial.""
24Dr Furst adhered to his opinion, that by reference to the legal tests referred to above, Mr Aller was unfit to be tried, and likely to remain so for a period of the next 12 months. 
25The Crown made arrangements for Dr Olav Nielssen to consult with Mr Aller in February 2014, and make an assessment of him, particularly in light of the two reports of Dr Furst which were supplied to Dr Nielssen. 
26I note that in September 2013, after consultations which took place in the course of 2013, Dr Nielssen had expressed the opinion that, as at September 2013, Mr Aller was fit to enter a plea and fit to stand trial.  Dr Nielsen had also expressed the view that Mr Aller should remain fit, providing he continued to receive adequate treatment.  However, by February 2014, in light of Mr Aller's intervening condition, Dr Nielssen had reconsidered his opinion. 
27Dr Nielssen said in his report of 28 February 2014 that he was satisfied that Mr Aller's mental state had deteriorated in the six months or so since the previous interview.  He noted that during that time, Mr Aller's symptoms of schizophrenia had continued, and that those symptoms had been the precipitating cause of at least his second, if not his third, suicide attempt. 
28Dr Nielssen also noted that there was a significant difference in the way in which Mr Aller was able to respond to the questions asked of him in this February 2014 interview, when compared with the 2013 interview. 
29Dr Nielssen, in his report of 28 February 2014, expressed this opinion, which I accept:
""Based on the observations made by Dr Furst, and Mr Aller's presentation at the time of the recent interview, I formed the impression that Mr Aller has experienced a relapse of his chronic schizophrenic illness.  The reasons for the deterioration in his condition are unclear, as it seems he has received consistent treatment with adequate doses of medication in the prison hospital and at the mental health area of the MRRC.  However, potential causes of the progression of psychotic illness include neurological changes arising as a result of hypoxic brain damage from attempted hanging, or from Wernicke's Encephalopathy associated with repeated episodes of Delirium Tremens.
Based on his recent presentation, I concur with the opinion of Dr Furst that Mr Aller is now unfit for trial.  He was unable to provide an adequate account of how he might respond to the charges in a way that confirmed he was able to provide his legal representatives with reliable instructions.  He was also unable to demonstrate that he understood the procedure followed in court or that he could follow any proceeding in an adequate way.
Mr Aller has a condition that is generally amenable to treatment.  However, the emergence of a more severe form of mental illness, despite continuous treatment suggests that his prognosis is poor, and he is unlikely to become fit for trial in the next 12 months."" 
Submissions
30The Crown submits that the Court should accept the expert opinions of both Dr Nielssen and Dr Furst and that, accordingly, it is open to the Court to be satisfied that Mr Aller's current mental state falls substantially below a number of the minimum criteria which the law requires before a person stands trial. 
31Mr Smith, counsel for Mr Aller, submits that the material provides overwhelming support for the Court to conclude that Mr Aller would not be able to understand the nature of the proceedings in court; he would not be to be able to follow the course of the proceedings, nor understand what was happening;, he would not understand the substantial effect of any evidence which may be given against him in support of the prosecution; and he would not be able to give his counsel instructions, including his version of the events, sufficient to make out a defence and answer the charge. 
Discernment
32As I have said, it is a feature of the common law that a criminal trial cannot proceed fairly if an accused does not understand what is happening, and is unable to give instructions with respect to any defence which may be open to him. 
33Of course, a finding that an accused is unfit to stand trial is one which has serious effects upon an accused, because what follows from such a finding is, in effect, indefinite incarceration.  It is ordinarily in the interests of an accused to be brought to trial as soon as is possible, rather than suffer such incarceration. 
34However, one has to balance, in conducting this inquiry, the public interest in having people accused of serious criminal offences tried, and a determination made by a jury, as to whether a person is or is not guilty of an offence, with subsequent punishment, if that be appropriate, together with the accused's own interests in having a trial as soon as possible, against the fairness of any such trial.  In undertaking that balance, I am abundantly satisfied on the evidence at this inquiry, that Mr Aller is presently mentally ill. Although being treated, his mental illness is such that it would not enable a fair trial to take place because, putting it as simply as I can, Mr Aller would not understand what was happening, and could not give his counsel any rational instructions to enable his counsel to properly conduct a defence.  It is clear to me that this position is unlikely to change in the next 12 months. 
35Accordingly, I am well satisfied, on the material before me, that Mr Aller is presently unfit to be tried for the offence of murder of Ms Aiton on 31 July 2012. 
36In those circumstances I make the following orders: 
(1)I find the accused, Michael Aller, is unfit to be tried. 
(2)In accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
(3)In accordance with s 14(b)(iii) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I remand Mr Aller in custody, until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to s 16 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
(4)I direct the Registrar of the Supreme Court to provide the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal within seven days: 
(a)a copy of this finding and my reasons; 
(b)a copy of the orders which I have made; 
(c)a copy of the transcript of these proceedings; and
(d)a copy of Exhibit A.

		01 April 2014",2014-03-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763550,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 329,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown case closed before morning tea on 24 March 2014, at the start of week six of the trial. After lunch on that day, Mr Pullinger of counsel for Ms Proud called her to give evidence. Part of that evidence was in the following terms:

""Q. Just stopping there, after he had left to go to Kmart, did he return only once or more than once to the unit that evening? 
A. As far as I know, just the once. 

Q. Are you aware what time it was he returned? 
A. I thought it was 1.30 but I can't be sure. 

Q. Where were you and what were you doing when he returned? 
A. I was in bed. I woke up to him coming in. 

Q. Did you speak with him? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you say to him and what did he say to you? 
A. He just jumped into bed and he told me it was all done. 

Q. Did you say anything in reply to that? 
A. I said, 'What was all done?'

Q. What did he say? 
A. He said that he went and bought petrol from the servo and Jiffy Firelighters. He then went around to Katie's house with Wendy. He went upstairs, poured the petrol around the bed. Katie woke up screaming, and he doesn't understand why she didn't get up and run, and then he left after that and Wendy lit the cloth but couldn't go through with it and threw it away. He re picked it up and threw it towards the bed. 

Q. Did you become aware that there had been a significant house fire and Katie Foreman had been killed in that house fire? 
A. Yes. 

Q. When did you become aware of that? 
A. The afternoon of that day morning. 

Q. In the afternoon of 27 October?
A. Yes. 

Q. When Mr Spicer told you about pouring petrol and picking up the cloth and throwing it towards, didn't you appreciate that somebody might have been killed? 
A. I just didn't think about it because I thought I was going on a holiday and I just wanted to go fishing and shopping.""

2At the conclusion of Ms Proud's evidence in chief, Mr Steel of counsel for Mr Spicer indicated that he wished to make an application for a separate trial. He submitted that the evidence in question came without notice and was embarrassing to his client, in the sense that it was unexpected and that he could not meet it. It was also inimical to the case that he opened to the jury and which through cross-examination he has consistently maintained on Mr Spicer's behalf throughout the trial.

3In context, Mr Spicer contends that he had no knowledge that the deceased was in her bedroom at the time he admittedly entered her house, ascended the stairs to the first floor and threw petrol from a bucket into the room where she lay sleeping. He contends that he had no foreknowledge of the presence of the deceased and did not acquire that knowledge while he was there. Principal among the reasons for that are that he threw the petrol into the bedroom from a position in the doorway to the bedroom from where his view of the deceased's bed was blocked by the built-in wardrobe on the southern wall immediately on his left. Further, the room was unlit and a blind shaded the window so that he was unable to see anything in the darkness of the bedroom with the naked eye. It is presumably also part of his case that there were no signs or other indications, either physically or circumstantially, from which or with the benefit of which he could reasonably have foreseen or anticipated the presence of the deceased in her bed at the time.

4The evidence given by Ms Proud is potentially wholly destructive of Mr Spicer's case. It is entirely contradictory, taken at face value, of his avowed unawareness of the deceased's presence at the time. It is also arguably very powerful in its specific terms as it contains or reveals details that Ms Proud could not ever otherwise have known, as she was not present at the premises at the time, and which had not until it was given by her, emerged directly or inferentially from any other source during the whole of the Crown case. There is no basis upon which the admissibility of the evidence can be or has been challenged: it constitutes an admission by Mr Spicer to Ms Proud immediately following his return to their motel room following the fatal fire that he entered the room and poured petrol around the deceased's bed, and that he was aware that she was present at the time.

5Mr Steel has already made two applications for a separate trial. I did not accede to either. He characterised the present application as a revival of those applications. In my opinion, the present application cannot be considered to be a revival of any previous application for a separate trial for at least two reasons. First, the present application does not proceed upon the original basis that it would not be possible, by the giving of an appropriate direction or warning to the jury, to cure potential prejudice to Mr Spicer that could arise from evidence against his co-accused that was inadmissible as evidence in the case against him. Secondly, the present application does not seem to me to be an application for a separate trial at all, so much as an application to discharge the jury and start again with his trial separated from those of his co-accused.

6Mr Steel referred to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, which is in the following relevant terms:

""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 

(1)...

(2) If of the opinion: 

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or 

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment, 

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment. 

(3)...""

7I do not accept that this provision applies to the present circumstances.

8There is no doubt that the evidence given by Ms Proud was unexpected. As I have indicated, there had been no foreboding of any evidence of that kind or of such force at any time throughout the trial. That is probably all the more so having regard to the fact that Ms Proud and Mr Spicer had been in a long term relationship and had three children of their own together, as well as from evidence tendered by the Crown in the course of which Ms Proud was seen to be loudly and emphatically loyal to Mr Spicer and consistently supportive of him at all times. It is not presently profitable to speculate about whether the recent evidence given by her was inadvertent or otherwise. There remains a distinct possibility approaching certainty, that subject to the outcome of Mr Spicer's present application, the question of the veracity or reliability of Ms Proud's evidence will be explored at some length and in some detail in the cross-examination of her by Mr Steel.

9I recognise that Mr Spicer now finds himself in a difficult and unenviable position. The question that underpins consideration of his application is whether that bespeaks some unfairness or other prejudice that is not simply a legitimate function of the conduct of a joint trial. There can of course be no certainty or other lesser assurance that the evidence given by Ms Proud could not or would not also be given by her at some later trial if that course were facilitated. Be that as it may, it remains important to understand and to determine whether Mr Spicer has been exposed or subjected to an unfairness in the trial process that imperils the likelihood or even the possibility of a just outcome on the one hand, or whether he has simply been dealt an unwanted and potentially fatal blow that is both contrary to his interests and completely at odds with the position he has chosen to adopt by evidence that is in all other respects admissible as evidence of an admission by him on the other hand.

10The apparently unexpected timing and content of this evidence are undoubtedly either alone or in combination embarrassing to Mr Spicer. They constitute a forensic challenge of significant proportions. They do not to my mind, however, also constitute an unfairness to him that is not the legitimate product of the trial process. They do not warrant the cessation of this trial so as to permit Mr Spicer to be given a trial alone, or the discharge of the jury upon some basis suggesting that a fair trial can no longer be achieved.

11The question can to my mind be tested in the following way: would the evidence of Ms Proud, to which exception is now taken, have been capable of supporting a successful application for a separate trial if it had originally been foreshadowed and notified by the Crown as part of its case in the first place? I am unable to see that it could have been. Mr Spicer may well have had more time to come to terms with the evidence and to employ and prepare a forensic approach with knowledge of it, but the potentially destructive effect of the evidence would have been no less. It would not have been grounds for a separate trial. 

12The late emergence of the evidence is the only issue about which any acceptable complaint can be made. To the extent that Mr Steel requires some reasonable accommodation to permit him to adjust his position so as to be able to deal with this development, it goes without saying that it should be given to him. I will hear any submissions about that if it becomes necessary.

2763560,R v Chan; R v Jun [2014] NSWDC 43,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 11 October last year the offenders, Terry Chan and Won Jun, appeared in the District Court when his Honour, the Chief Judge, adjourned their matters to 19 December 2013, the matters to be dealt with together. On 19 December Mr Parsons of counsel appeared for Mr Jun and Mr Thomas of counsel appeared for Mr Chan. For reasons which I do not know and which are probably immaterial in any case the sentence proceedings were adjourned to today, 28 March 2014.

2The matter was put into my list to be dealt with at 10 o'clock. Yesterday afternoon Mr Thomas telephoned my associate and left a message for her. The effect of that message was that he understood that the matter was listed for sentence at 2 o'clock, and that he could not be present at 10 o'clock because he was part heard in a trial. My associate telephoned Mr Thomas this morning indicating that I would be in a position to proceed at 10 o'clock and expected the matter to proceed then, subject to any application for an adjournment.

3When I arrived on the bench this morning Mr Wrench, a solicitor, appeared for Mr Chan; Mr Parsons, as before, appeared for Mr Jun. Mr Wrench applied for an adjournment on the basis that Mr Thomas was unavailable, he being the person who had close involvement with the matter. Mr Wrench submitted that in effect justice would not be done were I to force the matter on with Mr Wrench representing Mr Chan. When I enquired of Mr Wrench what he had done to have the matter ready for hearing today, given that he was made aware yesterday that Mr Thomas would not be here at 10 o'clock, Mr Wrench indicated that all he had done was some administrative matters and he had not prepared the matter as an advocate, at least partly because he expected that the matter would be adjourned.   It is apparent that Mr Thomas too has done nothing to have the matter ready to proceed at 10.00 am.

4At that stage I adjourned the matter for one hour for Mr Wrench to look further at the matter. I indicated that if there was to be a further application for adjournment that could be made when I returned. I should indicate that Mr Wrench submitted that he was not capable of doing justice to Mr Chan's case for a number of reasons including what he said was his inexperience, but perhaps more importantly because he said that he had not been present at all conferences between Mr Chan and Mr Thomas.

5On my return at 11.30 Mr James QC indicated that he now appeared for Mr Chan. He had come into the matter only moments before. Clearly he is in less of a position to present this matter on Mr Chan's behalf than Mr Wrench is. Mr James made a further application for an adjournment.

6The position is wholly unsatisfactory for many reasons. The matter was never listed at 2 o'clock today. Mr Thomas's suggestions to my associate that he believed that it was are simply wrong. I will refrain from expressing any opinion as to whether Mr Thomas genuinely believed that the matter was listed for 2 o'clock because that is immaterial to my decision. 

7There are many people awaiting their hearings in the District Court. The criminal lists have expanded enormously of recent times. People are in custody awaiting sentence. People are in custody awaiting trial. Many of those in custody awaiting trial will be acquitted. Those awaiting sentence are held on remand where access to courses, work, rehabilitative programs and the like is much more limited than those available to a sentenced prisoner. It is therefore important that the District Court deals with matters as efficiently and expeditiously as possible. What Mr Thomas and Mr Wrench have done is to prevent that occurring. 

8Mr Parson is, as am I, unable to deal with this matter at 2.00 pm. I should say at this stage that I regard it as important that the matters of Chan and Jun be dealt with together. Too often inconsistent findings of fact are made on sentencing proceedings where co-offenders are dealt with separately even before the same judge. Admissible evidence when sentencing offender A may indicate that offender A is less culpable than offender B, but then different evidence admitted when sentencing offender B indicates precisely the opposite. It is therefore important, where possible, that co-offenders are dealt with during the same sentencing proceedings. 

9I propose to grant Mr James' application for an adjournment and to list the matter for sentence at a date that I will discuss with counsel shortly. However, before concluding these remarks I should indicate that I propose to send a copy of these remarks to the Bar Association and to the Law Society of New South Wales for their investigation as to the conduct of the legal practitioners in this case.

2763564,McLennan v Antonios [2014] NSWDC 78,"Judgment

1The plaintiff by statement of claim filed on 5 April 2012 brings proceedings for damages arising out of the circumstances of a collision between her motor vehicle and the motor vehicle the first defendant was driving, which occurred at the intersection of Cumberland Highway and Canley Vale Road on 18 June 2009.

The differing versions of the accident

4The plaintiff was driving her vehicle south along Cumberland Highway to the intersection of Canley Vale Road at approximately 11:30pm. She proposed to make a right hand turn into Canley Vale Road. The first defendant's vehicle was travelling in the opposite direction along Cumberland Highway. The plaintiff's evidence was that she stopped at the middle of the intersection and waited until the lights facing her turned red then, after first checking in front of her, commenced a right hand turn. The traffic in the opposite direction having come to a halt at the red lights, except for the empty last lane, the plaintiff made her turn. The first defendant sped along the inside lane closest to the building alignment and collided with her vehicle.

5The first defendant gave a similar version of seeing the plaintiff's vehicle stationary in the middle of the road, but states that the lights were green in his favour at all times and that the plaintiff's vehicle, which he observed only when at the intersection to be stationary, suddenly ""popped out of nowhere"" (T 135). He had no opportunity to take any evasive action and the vehicles collided.

6There were no witnesses to the accident, but a driver, Mr Tran, who had made a right hand turn in the same direction as the plaintiff, and who had previously observed the plaintiff's headlights in his rear vision mirror, heard the sound of the accident and looked over his shoulder. He stopped his car and approached the plaintiff's car, observing smoke coming from the engine. Fearing the plaintiff's car was about to ""blow up"", he and an unknown passer-by pulled the plaintiff from the vehicle.

7This witness gave his details to the police and later completed a police statement. Whether the lights were green or red is not referred to in the statement. In the witness box, Mr Tran stated that, after he heard the sound of the collision, he observed the lights were still green in the first defendant's favour.

8Neither the plaintiff nor the first defendant saw Mr Tran's vehicle at any time.

The plaintiff's evidence

9The plaintiff, who was born in 1990 and who was 19 years of age at the date of the accident, completed her schooling to the Higher School Certificate level, although for insufficient subjects to have a percentile (T 6). An enthusiastic gymnast, she completed a Level 1 Coaches course, which enabled her to coach all sorts of children both inside and outside school. She had started working as a gymnastics coach whilst still at high school (T 5) and continued this work after completing her schooling, being employed by the YMCA in Epping to teach gymnastics from a stage of basic forward rolls, bunny hops, handstands, cartwheels, front flips, back flips, use of pommel horses and the like (T 7). As a gymnastics teacher she needed to be able to provide the children with safety and support, and physical fitness was important.

10On the day in question, the plaintiff had been given the day off work, as it was her boyfriend's birthday. She was travelling from her boyfriend's home to the home where she resided with her mother and father, and this was a road she was familiar with as she had travelled it ""everyday"" (T 10). She had not had anything to drink. The weather was fine and the roadway was dry. It was in these circumstances that she came to the intersection at which the accident occurred:

""Q. As you drew up, or drove up to the intersection, what was the light in front of you?
A. Green.

Q. You moved out into the intersection?
A. Yes.

Q. What was the situation with oncoming traffic, if any?
A. There was a few cars coming through, I couldn't get through, so I waited.

Q. Whilst you were waiting, did that green light change at all?
A. Yes.

Q. To what?
A. Yellow.

Q. When that occurred, what was the position in respect of those oncoming vehicles that you just told us about?
A. Three cars had come to a stop.

Q. Just pausing now, I want you to have a look at exhibit B now?
A. Yep.

Q. You see that the lanes are marked A, B, and C and D?
A. Yes.

Q. Please tell us in which lane the vehicles had come to a stop?
A. A, B and C.

Q. When that occurred, what was the position with the light that was facing you?
A. It was red.

Q. I beg your pardon?
A. Red.

Q. Incidentally, I should ask, was there any other sort of arrow, red arrow, orange arrow?
A. No.

Q. Just a single red light?
A. Yes.

Q. What happened next?
A. I proceeded with my turn.

Q. How far had you managed to proceed into the turn before something happened?
A. I was in front of lane D.

Q. I beg your pardon?
A. I was in front of lane D.

Q. D for dog?
A. Yes.

Q. What happened?
A. The car came and hit my car.

Q. The car that hit your car immediately before that happened, did you see which lane it was travelling in?
A. D.

Q. I want you to describe for her Honour, Ms McLennan, whether it was a forceful impact or a small impact, can you tell us?
A. It was a forceful impact.

Q. Did something in fact happen to your seatbelt?
A. Yes, it snapped.

Q. Did your vehicle then move in a different direction?
A. Yes.

Q. Where did it go?
A. It came back it went back towards where I started in the middle of the island.

Q. But on the wrong side of Cumberland Road?
A. Yes."" (T 10-13)

11The plaintiff was certain that as she approached the intersection the lights were green and that there was no vehicle travelling directly in front of her as she entered the right turn lane:

""Q. As you approached the intersection were the lights green or red?
A. Green.

Q. Were they green for the entire time as you call recall as you approached the intersection?
A. Yes.

Q. Was it just effectively a green dot, no arrow.
A. Yes.

Q. You told us that you approached the intersection and you went into the right turn lane, correct.
A. Yes.

Q. As you entered the right turn lane were there any vehicles directly in front of you?
A. Only the one that was turning in the opposite direction.

Q. Just so I understand it, you mean the vehicle in a right turn lane travelling in the opposite direction to which you were travelling.
A. Yes.

Q. Similarly turning right into Canley vale Road but to the other side of Canley Vale Road.
A. Yes.

Q. Perhaps I can be a bit clearer. Were there any vehicles travelling directly in front of your vehicle when you entered the right turn lane?
A. No."" (T 82-83)

12The plaintiff described the change of lights as follows:

""Q. In any event, you say that you came up into the right turn lane, and correct me if I'm wrong, there was traffic travelling in the opposite direction, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. When you first got to the lights you stopped did you?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you stop into the intersection or did you stop actually at the stop line. Do you understand what I mean by that?
A. I stopped at the stop line and then moved forward.

Q. When you first stopped at the stop line was there traffic coming the other way?
A. Yes.

Q. At what point did you move forward as in how long after you stopped at the stop line?
A. I don't recall how long I waited.

Q. In any event, you say you then moved forward into the intersection and, again, do you say that at the time you moved forward into the intersection there were no cars directly in front of you also turning right?
A. There was noone in front of me.

Q. Well I want to suggest to you that that's just wrong, isn't it?
A. No.

Q. There was a car directly in front of you wasn't there?
A. No.

Q. You say that the lights then changed to red, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. You said that the lights turned red and that in fact a number of vehicles then stopped at the red lights, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. How many vehicles do you recall stopped at the red lights?
A. Three.

Q. In which lanes were they, and if you want to adopt the same you remember the A, B, C and D Mr Khandhar asked you yesterday about?
A. Yes, A, B and C were stopped.

Q. They were three cars across next to each other on the stop line, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. Were there any further cars stopped behind the cars in either A, B or C?
A. I don't remember."" (T 83-84)

13The plaintiff described her view of the oncoming traffic, including any traffic behind these cars which had stopped as follows:

""Q. The position is that from where if in fact you were at that point, you were into the intersection and there were cars stopped across those lanes, I suggest to you that you would be able to see cars approaching beyond those cars wouldn't you?
A. Yes.

Q. Yet you say that right up until the moment of impact you did not see this car at all. That's the case, isn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. So that even from the time from when you were stopped in the intersection, you saw other cars pull up, correct.
A. Yes.

Q. You say this other vehicle that was ultimately involved was sight unseen, that's what you say.
A. Yes.

Q. But those cars then stopped, correct.
A. Yes.

Q. You say that vehicle still was sight unseen, correct.
A. Yes.

Q. Then as you proceeded to turn right again I suggest you still would have had a view beyond those vehicles, wouldn't you, up the street, up the hill?
A. I wasn't looking for any other vehicles.

Q. Well at what point do you say you stopped looking for other vehicles, at what point. Was it before you started to turn, was it in the course of your turn?
A. It was in the course of the turn.

Q. How far into the turn was it that you stopped looking for vehicles coming down the road?
A. When I was halfway around.

Q. So right up until the point in which you were halfway round that turn you saw no other vehicles?
A. I saw no other vehicles.

Q. You agree, don't you, that as you were in that first half of the turn you still would have had an opportunity to see any vehicles beyond the stationary vehicles, wouldn't you?
A. Yes.

Q. Yet you didn't see any?
A. No, I didn't.

Q. You say that you were halfway through the turn when you started to look somewhere else and I assume what you say is you start to look down the road you were into, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. It was only moments, literally moments, after you stopped looking down the hill that impact happened, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. So just in terms of timing, you've proceeded into the middle of the intersection, then the lights turn orange and then red, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. There was then a period of time, I take it, where in fact you saw these vehicles approaching, correct, the other way?
A. Yes.

Q. You saw that they stopped, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. I take it they stopped as the lights changed, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. There was then a period of time, I take it, after it turned red where you say you were perhaps satisfying yourself that these vehicles weren't going to come through, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Then you started to turn, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. So would it be fair to say that on your evidence before you even started to turn the lights had been red for some time?
A. No.

Q. Well they'd been read for sufficient time for the other vehicles to stop, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. For you to be satisfied they'd stopped, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. Then for you to start to commence your turn, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. So I suggest to you that the lights would have been red for at least a number of seconds before you started to turn?
A. Yeah."" (T 84-86)

14The plaintiff agreed (T 88) that when she actually entered the intersection, she had no idea when the lights could turn red or how long the lights had been green (T 87-88). She knew that she had to give way to cars travelling in the opposite direction, but had no idea how long she would have to wait when she entered the intersection (T 88). By the time the lights turned to red she was in a position where she was already in the middle of the intersection, which meant she could be obstructing any traffic that would have a green light coming along Canley Vale Road (T 89). That meant she had no choice but to proceed through what was, by that stage, a red signal according to her evidence (T 89 line 15).

15It was put to her that she had failed to observe the car directly ahead of her at the intersection, namely the car driven by Mr Tran. The plaintiff was insistent that there was no car in front of her (T 31). It was put to her that she directly followed Mr Tran's car through the intersection without stopping, and turned right behind him, but she denied this (T 89). It was also put to her that there were no cars stationary at the red light (T 90) and that, as she turned, there were other cars, including the car which struck her, coming in the opposite direction (T 90 lines 18-21). The plaintiff said that this was not the case.

16In re-examination, the plaintiff confirmed that she had proceeded on the red light, not the orange light and confirmed her account of the accident to the police. That account is as follows:

""I was waiting in the middle of the intersection, waiting to turn right onto Canley Vale Road. And then there was a lot of traffic, then the lights changed and three cars stopped in front of me. Then I turned right because they stopped and I couldn't see anything else."" (Exhibit E, p. 1)

17The plaintiff was asked by the police officer:

""Q. Did you see any other cars travelling on the Cumberland [Road] in the other direction?A. Yes there was. There were a few gaps but I couldn't get through. That's why I waited.Q. What were the lights when you turned?A. Just the one red light, there was no arrow or anything.

Q. When did you first see the car that you had the [accident] with?A. Just when we hit each other.Q. Did you have your lights on?A. Yeah."" (Exhibit E)

18This statement was given on Sunday 9 August 2009, approximately two months after the accident in question.

19In practical terms, the plaintiff's version of her reason for turning right is that the lights had changed and that, as she was stationary in front of oncoming traffic with the green light along Canley Vale Road, it was necessary to complete her turn. She denied seeing the independent witness called by the defendant, Mr Tran. In order to determine the significance of this apparent omission, it is necessary to consider the evidence of the first defendant, Mr Antonios.

The first defendant's evidence

20On the night in question, the first defendant was driving a vehicle belonging to his father (the second defendant). Like the plaintiff, he failed to notice Mr Tran's vehicle making a right hand turn within seconds of the plaintiff's vehicle. The first defendant described the accident as follows:

""Q. Can you recall which lane you were driving in as you approached the intersection at Canley Vale Road?
A. Yep, I was in the you would say I know across from the front of the lights there's four lanes, but one, the last lane is the right lane that turns right, I was in the one next to that which is the third lane over so if you would say C, if it was 

Q. So to put it another way, the lane closest towards the middle of the road that wasn't a right turn lane?
A. That's correct, yeah.

Q. Can you recall as you approached the intersection, firstly, what colour were the lights?
A. Green.

Q. For the period of time during which you approached this intersection, did the lights change at all?
A. No, it was green.

Q. So you proceeded down in that particular lane, approaching Canley Vale Road, is that right?
A. That's right.

Q. Do you recall whether there was any other traffic around you, travelling in the same direction?
A. There was no other traffic, it was late at night, I remember seeing cars on the other sides of the road, but I was actually the only car on that side of the road.

Q. As you approached the intersection, firstly can you give her Honour, or do you know what sort of speed you were travelling at?
A. It was about between 60 and 65.

Q. Can you tell us what happened, as you approached the intersection did you see any traffic on the other side of the intersection, do you recall?
A. As in, in front of me, cars in front?

Q. Yes?
A. There was no cars in front of me, no.

Q. Can you then tell her Honour what happened as you approached the intersection and entered the intersection?
A. As I entered the intersection, or had just before, I realised there was a car on my right but as I was approaching, the car came to turn and stopped.

Q. Where did the car stop?
A. In my lane.

Q. What, if anything, did you then do?
A. Immediately tried to brake and turn away.

Q. Yes?
A. But it was obviously too late.

Q. What happened?
A. They collided at the front of her vehicle.

Q. What part of your vehicle collided with the other vehicle?
A. My whole left and front.

Q. You collided with what part of the other vehicle you can recall?
A. I just remember it was it was pretty front on, it was more the if you're looking at the vehicle, her vehicle, you're looking at it it's the right side.

Q. What happened after the impact between the two vehicles?
A. Well I had tried to swerve away, it wasn't successful and we had collided. Her car obviously got pushed back and I came off to the side of the road where the footpath is, after the lights.

Q. At the time that you proceeded through the intersection what colour was the light?
A. Green."" (T 130-132)

21Although there was no other traffic on the road, according to the first defendant, he did not observe the plaintiff's vehicle until he entered the intersection or ""just before"". He said that he was proceeding through the intersection because he had the right of way by reason of the green light. However, his evidence in relation to the distance at which he saw the plaintiff's vehicle changed in cross-examination to being ""from a distance"". In addition, not only did he state that she had pulled out in front of him, but he stated that she had ""turned and stopped"":

""Q. So you remember driving along and seeing the car that ultimately was involved in the collision there waiting to make a righthand turn do you?
A. I wouldn't say waiting. As I was approaching the intersection the car had turned and stopped. So as I had took notice of the car it was stopped in the middle of the intersection.

Q. But you said a few minutes ago you realised there was a car on your right, that's the first thing that you saw?
A. That's right, from a distance.

Q. So on your right would be on that car's correct side of the roadway would it?
A. Sorry, can you ask that again?

Q. You were travelling on one direction on the Cumberland Highway, that's right isn't it?
A. Yeah.

Q. It's pretty safe to assume, isn't it, that the car that was involved in the collision with you was going in the opposite direction originally on the Cumberland Highway?
A. That's correct sir.

Q. You didn't see that did you, you didn't see it travelling along on the Cumberland Highway, or did you?
A. All I remember is that as I was approaching I took notice of a car which from a distance didn't realise or didn't you wouldn't think a car would pull out in front of you so so she turned and stopped."" (T 132)

22The defendant then claimed that he had attempted to slow down at the lights, adding that ""Why would I speed?"":

""Q. So the first time you saw that car was it stopped on its side of the road in that righthand turn lane on the Cumberland Highway?
A. I had seen the car stopped the first time I had seen it.

Q. With its blinker on?
A. Yes.

Q. Intending, pretty obviously, to make a righthand turn?
A. Correct.

Q. Correct?
A. Yes.

Q. When you saw it there did you slacken your speed at all or did you just keep going?
A. Of course. You tend to as you approach any lights you slow down.

Q. Well the speed limit in this area's 70 kilometres per hour isn't it?
A. That's correct.

Q. You're driving a high powered car, a six litre V8 Holden aren't you?
A. That's correct, yeah.

Q. It's late at night, that's right isn't it?
A. Of course

Q. According to you no traffic around except for this car, is that right?
A. Yeah.

Q. Why would you be doing 60 or 65 along that road rather than the speed limit?
A. Why would I speed? I'm not in a hurry to get home.

Q. Well Mr Antonios the answer ""Why would I speed"" you know why you would speed; because you enjoy doing it?
A. No I don't.

Q. In any event you see the car there and you slow down do you?
A. I had seen the car and I slowed down towards the intersection, yep.

Q. Then what did you see the car do?
A. Pull out in front of me and stopped.

Q. Across your lane?
A. That's correct.

Q. Then you tell us that you took evasive action by braking and swerving?
A. That's correct.

Q. But you were unable to avoid a collision?
A. That's right."" (T 133-134)

23The first defendant's statement ""why would I speed?"" lead to cross-examination about his driving record. I allowed the tender of the first defendant's driving record and indicated that I would give reasons for doing so in my judgment.

The first defendant's driving record

24The first defendant objected to any cross-examination of the first defendant on his driving record. The first defendant in cross-examination said he considered he was a safe driver who did not speed on the night in question because ""why would one speed"" (T 134). He also disputed the reason for his current licence being provisional.

25The basis of the first defendant's objection were:

(1)This evidence is tendency evidence (s 97 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)) and no notice had been given; and

(2)Relevance.

26The parties could not take me to any decisions dealing with such a submission. In Cartwright v Bluescope Steel Ltd (2013) 64 MVR 270 at [26]-[28], Simpson J noted:

""[26] I'm satisfied that the plaintiff was not, on this occasion, driving differently from the manner in which he had regularly driven that route. The speed had been safe in the past; it was safe on this occasion, had there not been a variation in the load.

[27] Having regard to the speed limit, and that there are no advisory or limiting signs in respect of heavy vehicles, I cannot say that a speed of 60.4kph (or even 61kph) was, in the circumstances appertaining to the road conditions, excessive. The evidence is that it was daylight, the weather was good, and the traffic light. Mr Currie did not observe anything untoward about the manner of the plaintiff's driving.

[28] Curiously, the plaintiff's driving record was put in evidence in his own first witness statement. It is not good. He has a long history of offences of exceeding the speed limit. However, no attempt was made to rely on his record as tendency evidence (see s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995) and I do not propose to use it in that way. Indeed, in final oral argument, senior counsel for Bluescope disclaimed reliance on tendency evidence.""

27In Thornton v Sweeney (2011) 59 MVR 155 the New South Wales Court of Appeal noted a similar submission was not developed (at [8]).

28The situation here is similar. The first defendant's driving record is not good. This evidence is relevant not only to his credit but as tendency evidence. No notice was given.

29Conformably with s 100 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), I propose to admit the evidence, which is probative for the reasons noted by Simpson J. In doing so I have taken into account the checklist in s 100(4) Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).

30Alternatively, I would dispense under s 190 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) with compliance with s 97, having regard to the checklist at s 190(4).

31The relevance of such evidence is clear from the remarks of Simpson J at [26]-[28], and I reject the objection made in reliance upon s 55.

32Mr Lidden SC did not in fact rely upon the first defendant's driving record as tendency evidence. It was tendered essentially in relation to an issue of credit, in much the same way as appears to have occurred in Cartwright v Bluescope Steel Ltd, supra, at [26]-[28].

33The first defendant's driving record is, however, relevant to his credit. It is not to the first defendant's credit that he sought to put himself forward as a safe driver (T 138 lines 1-11) when in fact at the time he was on a newly issued provisional licence because of loss of points, which licence had been issued 10 days prior to the accident in question. Not only did he state in his evidence that he considered he was a safe driver (T 138 line 3) but he disputed the circumstances in which his licence was suspended until shown his driving record (T 138 line 26-32).

34The first defendant agreed that the vehicle he was driving, which was purchased in his father's name because of the first defendant's uncertainty as to whether he would be able to drive such vehicle with his driving record (T 139), was ""capable of very high speed"" (T 139-140).

Conclusions concerning the account of the accident given by the first defendant

35The first defendant agreed he told the police that the plaintiff had ""just popped out of nowhere and hit me"". He was asked:

""Q. Well that wouldn't be right would it because she didn't pop out of nowhere, you had seen her there with her indicator on intending obviously to make a righthand turn, that's not popping out of nowhere is it?
A. My definition of ""popping out of nowhere"" is assuming a car's in your right lane, seeing a car approaching, you don't exactly turn in front of a car suddenly.

Q. But you see that's not popping out of nowhere, that's popping out of somewhere where you've seen the car isn't it?
A. Popping out would describe what I what I call a last minute

Q. But I'm interested in the ""nowhere"" you see?
A. Yeah that's my choice."" (T 135-136)

36The first defendant went on to explain:

""A. Well I've I do recall I would say something like ""pop out of nowhere"" yeah, because that's how you would describe something that was very sudden and, you know, like last minute, do you know what I mean. I wasn't exactly a planned turn, it was something that was very last minute; she saw the car approaching and in my eyes she broke and stood there so it was too late.

Q. Well I'm going to read out a question and an answer to you Mr Antonios. The question is, ""Did you see the car turn in front of you?"" and your answer was ""I know she was turning right, she just popped out of nowhere and hit me and my car spun around"". Just assume from me that's in the notebook, you'll see that you left out anything about the car stopping in front of you, not a word about that was there?
A. I haven't read the statement."" (T 136)

37The first defendant acknowledged he had not said anything to the police about braking but denied that he had ""whizzed"" through a red light. He denied that he had any concerns about loss of his provisional licence if the accident were regarded as his fault (T 137). (I note in this regard that the plaintiff, who was also on a provisional licence, would have lost her licence for the same reason, and that this is not a motive which can be ascribed to the first defendant alone.)

38The first defendant's version of events in his evidence is internally inconsistent, and differs from his statement to the police. His claim that the plaintiff ""just popped out of nowhere"" is implausible, given the degree of visibility for oncoming traffic which he admits he had. On the first defendant's version, the plaintiff's vehicle remained stationary at the lights and then suddenly turned in front of his vehicle in circumstances where he either saw her stationary at the lights from some distance, or alternatively only first noticed her as he entered the intersection.

39This brings me to the evidence of Mr Tran.

The evidence of Mr Tran

40Mr Tran described the accident as follows:

""Q. As you approached that intersection which way did you intend to turn?
A. INTERPRETER: I intended to turn right from the Cumberland Highway into Canley Vale Road.

Q. What are the lanes at Cumberland Highway in the area where you were turning?
A. INTERPRETER: There was a righthand lane to turn into Canley Vale Road.

Q. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights, is that right?
A. INTERPRETER: Yeah, there was red lights on that day.

Q. As you approached the intersection what colour were the lights for the way you were going?
A. INTERPRETER: Green.

Q. Was it a green circle, was it a green arrow, was it both, which one?
A. INTERPRETER: A green circle.

Q. As you approached the intersection and went into the right turn lane did you notice whether there were any cars behind you?
A. INTERPRETER: Yes, there was a car behind me.

Q. Do you know what sort of car it was?
A. INTERPRETER: It was dark, it was night time, I just saw the headlights that's all.

...

Q. You went into the right turn lane, what if anything did you see of other traffic?
A. INTERPRETER: It was very little traffic at the time.

Q. Was there any traffic coming the other way?
A. INTERPRETER: There was a car.

Q. What did you do?
A. INTERPRETER: I saw it was a long way off and it was safe enough so I turned.

...

Q. At the point that you commenced your turn where was this car that you had seen behind you?
A. INTERPRETER: When I was turning I was more worried about turning so I didn't look in the rear vision.

Q. Can you tell us what then happened as you commenced to turn?
A. INTERPRETER: As I started to turn, make the turn into the Canley Vale Road I heard a very loud bang.

Q. What, if anything, did you do when you heard the bang?
A. INTERPRETER: I saw as I turned over my right hand shoulder, I saw the car that had been behind me had been hit and I stopped."" (T 102-103)

41Mr Tran was cross-examined at some length about issues which are of little significance to the case. This included a claim that he had embellished his evidence, with a reference to there being flames coming from the vehicle (words were that there was ""a lot of smoke but only a little flame"" (T 113, line 19)), which was described as a ""pretty dramatic phrase"" which he had left out of his statement. In fact as Mr Tran's statement makes clear, he ""thought the car was going to blow up so I pulled the girl from the car and put her on the footpath"" (Exhibit F, paragraph 6).

42Mr Lidden SC said:

""Q. You're trying to portray yourself as a bit of a hero for getting her out of a burning car, aren't you?
A. INTERPRETER: Any person wouldn't leave someone in a burning car."" (T 114)

43Mr Lidden SC sought to cross-examine Mr Tran about whether, from the state of the photographs of the plaintiff's vehicle, there would have been a fire. I did not permit this cross-examination and indicated that I would give reasons for refusing to do so in my judgment (T 117).

44In Angel v Hawkesbury City Council (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-955 and Blacktown City Council v Hocking (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-956 the Court of Appeal warned trial judges about interpreting matters requiring expertise from photographs. To be requiring a witness to postulate whether, from the state of a photograph, there had been a fire in a car engine is, in my view, evidence calling for the expression of an expert opinion.

45 I am satisfied that the description given by Mr Tran to police, namely that he feared the car was about to blow up, was an accurate description of the circumstances in which he had, together with another passer-by, and in circumstances of considerable risk, dragged the plaintiff from her vehicle. He said he was afraid that the car was going to catch fire (T 118) and I am satisfied that it was because he saw smoke and fear, or saw flame, that he took this step.

46In the course of giving this evidence, both Mr Tran and the interpreter appeared to be distressed. As I note at T 119, Mr Tran had his head in his hands several times and he appeared to be smiling. Mr Lidden SC submitted that this was misbehaviour on the part of the interpreter.

47In Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic (2006) 66 NSWLR 186, the Court of Appeal warned about the danger of misinterpreting the cultural responses of witnesses as being evidence of inappropriate demeanour. Conformably with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic, supra, I do not regard the fact that both Mr Tran and the interpreter responded in this fashion as evidence of misbehaviour, lying or other wrongdoing. Nor do I consider it is necessary to enquire if the interpret comes from ""the same culture as the witness"" as requested by Mr Lidden SC (T 120, line 22).

48The real issue for determination is not the credibility of Mr Tran, who I find was a honest and straightforward witness doing his best to assist the court, but what to make of the failure to mention the green light in his statement to the police in circumstances where he now says in his oral evidence that the light was green in favour of the first defendant. His description of the accident in his police statement of 19 June 2009 was as follows:

""5. I slowed down as I wanted to make a right hand turn onto Canley Vale Road. I saw that the traffic light facing me was showing a green light but there was no green arrow. I slowed and came to a complete stop at the intersection of the Cumberland Highway and Canley Vale Road. I could see that the yellow Excel was following me and was also in the turning lane directly behind me to turn right.

6. I could see another car's headlights on the other side of the road on the Cumberland Highway heading the opposite way. I had enough time to turn so I completed my right hand turn. When I finished my turn I heard a big bang. I looked into my rear view mirror and saw that the yellow Excel was spinning out of control. I pulled over and ran over to the Excel which was on the medium strip of the Cumberland Highway. I saw a female sitting in the drivers seat. She opened the door and I could hear her screaming ""My leg hurts."" I could see smoke coming from the engine and I could smell it. I thought the car was going to blow up so I pulled the girl from the car and put her on the footpath."" (Exhibit F)

49Exhibit G is a letter from the Roads and Traffic Authority giving the phasing detail for the lights in question. It is clear that there are four seconds of amber signal, followed by a red signal.

50Although Mr Tran in his statement describes the plaintiff's vehicle as a yellow Excel directly following him and in the turning lane directly behind him, he said in his evidence that at the time he could only see her lights. 

51Returning to the description of the accident by the plaintiff and first defendant, both described her vehicle remaining stationary at the intersection, suggesting that, rather than simply following Mr Tran's vehicle and turning right, she independently stopped for several seconds, during which time Mr Tran's car completed his turn. This would also explain why neither the plaintiff nor the first defendant saw the plaintiff's vehicle; if Mr Tran's vehicle had already completed its turn before the plaintiff commenced her turn, the fact that there had been another vehicle making a right hand turn would have been forgotten by both the plaintiff and the first defendant.

52Mr Tran was an honest witness who was doing his best to assist the court. However, it is clear from his evidence that, while he remembers those parts of the events which are of most relevance to him, such as hearing the bang and helping the plaintiff to get out of her vehicle, his recollection of other events at about that time is poor. He remembers speaking to a police officer at the scene of the accident and that the police officer took notes which he signed. However had completely forgotten going to the police station to make a statement which was typed up (T 107-110). He had not seen his police statement since. The police officer's notes for the accident neither do not exist or have not been tendered, but whether or not Mr Tran was interviewed, clearly he spent some time at the police station preparing his witness statement, and these are events that he had subsequently forgotten. The absence of a reference to the light being green in favour of the first defendant is, in my view, compelling evidence.

53In the course of oral submissions, Mr Lidden SC submitted that it was open to the defendants to have tendered any statement made by Mr Tran to the investigator or to the solicitors for the defendants to establish that the evidence of seeing the green light was not a reconstruction. As Mr Fitzsimmons points out in his submissions of 11 March 2014, these submissions by the plaintiff were misconceived. Firstly, the rule in Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 does not permit such an interference to be drawn as the rule cannot be employed to fill in gaps in evidence: Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) v Hellicar (2012) 247 CLR 347 at [232]-[234] per Heydon J; Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd (No 4) (2006) 229 ALR 136 at [50] per Heerey J. In addition, a party should not be called upon to waive legal professional privilege in such circumstances.

Conclusions concerning the circumstances of the accident

54When a dramatic event such as a motor vehicle accident occurs, the most honest of witnesses can be in error about issues such as a few seconds of timing. On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not follow in the wake of Mr Tran's car, but that she stopped before turning right, and that, in the course of so doing, the lights changed from green to amber to red. She then had to make her turn because she was stationary in front of oncoming traffic. The omission from Mr Tran's police statement of a reference to the light being green and being seen by him to be green after he heard the bang is in my view significant. I accept the plaintiff only turned right after the lights changed, and that the first defendant sped through the red light having either failed to observe the plaintiff at all, or assuming she would remain stationary.

55Accordingly, the plaintiff has established liability.

Contributory negligence

56A claim for contributory negligence was pleaded as follows:

(a)Failing to keep a proper lookout.

(b)Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for her own safety.

(c)Failing to give way to the first defendant.

(d)Making a right hand turn across the first defendant's path.

(e)Failing to steer, control and manoeuvre her motor vehicle so as to avoid a collision.

(f)Failure to apply her brakes in time, or at all, so as to avoid the collision.

(g)Failing to make her presence known to the first defendant.

(h)Failing to give way to oncoming traffic.

57I was not addressed on this topic at all by either counsel. No mention was made of contributory negligence by either counsel at any stage during the trial, including during the opening as well as during the closing submissions. In those circumstances, I propose to treat the claim for contributory negligence as having been abandoned. Any finding of contributory negligence would in any event be inconsistent with my findings on liability.

58This brings me to the issue of quantum.

Quantum

59The plaintiff has not achieved the threshold for non-economic loss. Accordingly, the relevant heads of damage are:

(1)Past and future out of pocket expenses;

(2)Past and future economic loss; and

(3)A claim for future home care.

60The issue of quantum has been clouded by the fact that the plaintiff suffered an additional accident on 20 August 2010 when she was thrown forward after a bus stopped suddenly. Her principal injuries on that occasion were to her right knee and to her nose. There is the possibility of arthritic change to her knee, but there is no evidence that arthritic change is likely to occur to her right lower leg in relation to the injury in the accident the subject of these proceedings.

61The plaintiff brought proceedings in relation to the subsequent injury to her right knee, and I take into account that there has been a settlement in relation to that claim, the terms of which are not before me. However, as is set out in the doctors' reports below, it is clear that the injury the subject of these proceedings is the principal injury.

62I have had the benefit of reading the reports of the treating doctor, Dr Jayker Davé. Dr Davé's reports carry considerable weight not simply because he was the treating doctor but also because, unlike the other experts who provided medicolegal reports for the plaintiff, he saw the plaintiff prior to her second accident.

Dr Jayker Davé

63Dr Davé in his report of 16 March 2011 stated:

""Ms McLennan has seen me in the rooms on the 07/07/2009 and the 07/08/2009, 18/09/2009 and finally on the 23/11/2010, when her fracture has been documented to have healed.

Last x-ray report dated the 11/09/2009 shows excellent alignment and bone union, not yet complete. At that stage Kirsty had done well and had returned back to work as a gym instructor, but unfortunately had a bus accident on the 20/08/2010, when the bus she was travelling in stopped suddenly and flung her forwards onto the windscreen. She hit her knee onto the driver's console.""

64Dr Davé describes the injuries from the ""two distinct accidents"" as being:

""The injuries are as noted above, with two distinct accidents being recorded. The first accident caused the fracture of her tibia along with the other soft tissue injuries as noted, whilst the second injury has caused the injury to the patellofemoral joint.""

65Dr Davé notes in his second report (31 August 2011) that the plaintiff had ""returned back to all activities"" as a gymnastic teacher, including running, jumping and flipping (p. 2).

66Dr Davé paints a picture of the plaintiff as having returned to all her activities as a gymnastic teacher and as having made a successful recovery from her injuries.

67Mr Lidden SC submitted that I should pay scant regard to these findings, as they are the findings of a doctor who is concerned only with the treatment of the plaintiff. I find this submission difficult to accept. To have recorded that she has returned back to all her activities as a gymnastic teacher, and not express any concern about her doing so, in circumstances where she had not in fact recovered, would be dangerous to the health of the plaintiff.

68Dr Davé's reports are those of a surgeon who is taking into account not only the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities, but also her ability to return to her former employment. Rather than viewing his reports as overconfident or overenthusiastic, I see them as the careful and considered opinions of the expert with the closest knowledge of the plaintiff's state of health.

Dr James Bodel

69Dr Bodel saw the plaintiff after the second accident on 15 November 2011 for medico-legal purposes. He states:

""Progress x-rays show that the fracture was slow to heal. She was given further time and remained on the crutches for about three to four months and then on a walking stick for another four or five months.

She was off work from all activities until December 2009 when she was able to return on a modified fashion. She could not demonstrate gymnastic activities and worked with smaller group. She also had to reduce her hours.

All other areas settled and the only ongoing complaint was in the region of the fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

She was unable to continue work with the elite squad of the girl gymnasts whom she had been working with."" (Report of 15 November 2011, p. 2)

70His conclusions are:

""In response to your specific questions I would indicate the following:

1. The nature and extent of the injuries sustained by our client. 

This lady suffered a serious injury in the first accident on 18 June 2009 where she suffered a fracture of the right tibia and fibula.

She suffered a more minor accident on 20 August 2010 where she suffered a closed head injury, contusion to the chest wall and an injury to the left elbow.

Ongoing disability mainly relates to the fracture of the tibia.

2. The nature and extent of the continuing disabilities from which our client is suffering.

This lady's continuing disabilities are pain and stiffness and swelling in the region of the right leg. This is principally at the fracture site and in the region of the right ankle.

3. Our client's capacity and fitness for work in general, particularly as to the effects of the injury.

This lady has returned to her pre-injury involvement in work as a gymnastics instructor.

She is struggling however as she cannot demonstrate all of the apparatus as she used to. She does not have the same skill set that she had prior to the injury.

4. The need for past and future domestic assistance.

This lady does require some domestic assistance for household maintenance and cleaning activities although I note that she indicates that she is managing.

As a result of the ongoing pathology in the region of the right leg I would recommend two hours domestic assistance per week on a commercial basis as a result of the effects of that ongoing disability in the right leg."" (Report of 15 November 2011, p 5)

71In a further report of 22 February 2013, Dr Bodel states:

""3. Our client's capacity and fitness for work in general, particularly as to the effects of the injury.

This lady has returned to work to her pre-injury style of work although in a reduced capacity and decreased hours.

In the longer term she will need to retrain in alternative duties which are predominantly of a sedentary type.

She should be able to upgrade to full time hours of work in appropriately modified duties.

4. The need for past and future domestic assistance.

This lady does require domestic assistance for household maintenance and cleaning activities.

At the time of the original injury on 18 June 2009 she did require eight hours' domestic assistance per week for a period of about eight months and then four hours' domestic assistance a week for another eight months and then two hours' domestic assistance a week ongoing after that.

She required a slight increase in her domestic assistance needs after the accident on 20 August 2010 for about four months and then back to the base level of required domestic assistance after that.

5. Your prognosis.

This lady's prognosis from the point of view of the fracture of the tibia is quite good.""

72As Dr Bodel's reports show, his reports conflate the first and second accidents, and he does not specifically allocate the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities to one accident or the other. He does, however, note that her prognosis from the point of view of the fracture of the tibia is ""quite good"". By reason of Dr Bodel's failure to differentiate between the two accidents, his reports are of limited assistance.

Dr Peter Conrad

73Dr Conrad's report of 14 December 2011 notes the plaintiff's history as follows:

""She was in hospital for a few days and then was discharged on crutches. She was followed up by Dr Dave. She had physiotherapy, but no further surgery.

At the time of the accident she was working as a gum instructress, doing about twenty-five hours per week. She was off work until September when she returned to light part-time work.

She got back to her full duties and then had a second accident on 20th August 2010 when she was a passenger in a bus when the bus stopped suddenly and she was fluing forwards onto the windscreen. She hit her right knee on the driver's console.""

74Dr Conrad's report of 14 December 2011 went on to say:

""OPINION: This lady was involved in two motor vehicle accidents, as previously described. As a result of the accident of the 18th June 2009, she sustained principally a fracture of the midshaft tibia and fibula, which were fixed with an intramedullary nail and screws and has united satisfactorily.

This was aggravated by the accident of the 20th August 2010 in which her principal injury was to her right knee and an injury to her nose, which has settled.

She has ongoing pain in her right lower leg and right knee and she needs conservative treatment. She may need physiotherapy from time-to-time.

She is well motivated and continues to work as a gym instructress, doing about fifteen hours per week and is able to do this providing she does not do an excessive amount of work involving jumping on her right leg or an excessive amount of running. This should all be part of a structured rehabilitation program.

There is a possibility that she may need removal of either the intramedullary nail and/or associated screws at a present day cost of some $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 and she would be off work for four weeks.

In the meantime she may need physiotherapy from time-to-time.

Her prognosis is guarded.""

75Dr Conrad's report of 21 August 2013 adds:

""Ms McLennan continues to be well motivated and continues to work as a gym instructress, doing some six hours per week and she is able to do this, providing she does not do an excessive amount of work involving jumping on her right leg or an excessive amount of running, squatting or lifting heavy weights. She may be able to do this work up until about 12 hours per week.

Alternatively, she would be able to do light work, up to 20 to 25 hours per week, such as light retail work or cleaning work or similar work, where she does not do an excessive amount of standing, walking, squatting or kneeling. This should be part of a structured rehabilitation program.

There is a possibility that she may need removal of her hardware, either the intramedullary nail and/or the associated screws at a present day cost of some $6,000.00 and she would be off work for about four weeks. She may need physiotherapy from time-to-time.

I have seen a report by Dr Clark, a Psychiatrist, assessing this aspect of her injury.

Her prognosis is guarded.""

76Dr Conrad's reports similarly comment on the plaintiff's medical condition in relation to both accidents. His reports, likely Dr Bodel's reports, should be viewed with caution in this regard.

Dr David Maxwell

77The plaintiff was also seen by Dr Maxwell on behalf of the defendants.

78Dr Maxwell's report of 30 August 2012 stated:

""She came under the care of orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Jay Dave. The next morning she had an operation. She had an intramedullary nail inserted into her right tibia with cross screws inserted to prevent rotation. She was in hospital for 4 days. She went home with crepe bandages on her leg using crutches. When she got home she lay on the couch. Because she said she was unsteady on her feet her dad took away her crutches after she had nearly slipped over.

She then started to ""hop around"". After one month her father gave her crutches back. She was followed up by Dr Davé who told her not to weight bear for 3 months. She then gradually started to weight bear. She changed to one crutch and then a cane. After 6 months she walked without support and returned to work. She said she has recovered quite well. Her right leg had become weak from inactivity. She had to rehabilitate her right leg.""

79Dr Maxwell further stated:

""She had a series of x-rays of her right tibia commencing on the 30/06/2009. It was noted that she had an intramedullary nail with cross screws. The alignment was excellent. There was a small butterfly fragment anteriorly. Sequential x-rays showed gradual healing of the fracture. It had united by the 10/2/2010.

The last x-ray taken on the 30/3/2011 showed the fracture had completely healed. There was some excessive callus formation causing some swelling at the fracture site. There were 2 proximal pins and distal screws. The overall alignment was anatomical.""

80Dr Maxwell gave the following diagnosis and opinion:

""DIAGNOSIS AND OPINION:

Kirsty McLennan was involved in 2 motor vehicle accidents. The 1st motor vehicle accident was more serious when she turned right at an intersection. At the time she admitted the light had changed to red. She was hit by a car that she claims was coming through the red light. She sustained a fractured tibia and this has healed in excellent position. She still has the intramedullary nail insitue.

The 2nd less severe accident occurred on the 20/8/2010. The bus stopped suddenly and she was thrown into the windscreen causing a contusion to her forehead and some soft tissue bruising. The effects of this injury settled rapidly.

Her minor continuing disability is due to the 1st motor vehicle accident.

I will answer your specific questions;

1. History - I have outlined the history in the body of the report. There were 2 motor vehicle accidents. The 1st was more severe.

2. Details of any prior or subsequent injuries or other condition affecting the claimant - The only other operation she has had was an operation on her jaw.

3. Diagnosis - She had had a fractured right tibia which is now united. She has very minimal residual disability with some discomfort after physical activity. There is no disability in relation to the motor vehicle accident of the 20/8/2010.

4. Is the treatment to date reasonable and necessary - I consider the treatment for the 1st motor vehicle accident was reasonable and necessary. There was no specific treatment required for the 2nd motor vehicle accident of the 20/8/2010.

5. Fitness to undertake pre-injury duties - I consider she is fit to undertake pre-injury work duties as a gymnastic instructor. She would also be fit for administrative work or any other form of work. She was restricted from carrying out her usual work following the 1st motor vehicle accident but only missed 3-4 days off after the 2nd motor vehicle accident.

6. Fitness for domestic duties - She is quite fit to undertake domestic duties without restrictions.

7. Prognosis - I consider her condition has stabilised.

8. Does the claimant require further surgery - She may require further surgery to remove the intramedullary nail if she continues to experience minimal symptoms. This would be related to the accident of the 18/6/2009.

9. Is the claimant fit to return to work as a gym instructor following the accident on the 20/8/2010? - Yes. The claimant was fit to return to work as a gym instructor following the 20/8/2010 motor vehicle accident.

10. Would the claimant have been fit to return to work as a gym instructor following the 18/6/2009 accident? - Yes. The claimant had been fit to return to work as a gym instructor following the 18/6/2009 motor vehicle accident.""

81Dr Maxwell's updating report of 26 November 2013 states:

""Ms McLennan does not experience as much swelling at the fracture site but occasionally it is a little tender and aches. She sometimes experiences an unusual symptom of her leg going completely numb from the knee down. She has to allow five to 10 minutes for the numbness to improve. This numbness comes on intermittently. She states she was in the surf and she developed numbness, was hit by a wave and was thrown into a rock. She went back to Dr Tablante who took another x-ray of her right knee on 18 February 2013. She states that her right knee hurts if she walks up hills. She states she still favours her right knee when demonstrating gymnastic manoeuvres. She still however uses the beam and does tumbling. She states she lands mainly on her left leg.

Currently she does not have any effects from the head injury. She feels that she has recovered from the soft tissue injury to her left forehead. She has no symptoms in relation to her chest or ribs. She has no symptoms in relation to the soft tissue bruising to the right hip. She has no symptoms in her knees. She has no symptoms in relation to her right and left elbow. She does not have any symptoms in relation to an alleged injury to the left leg. She has no symptoms in relation to an injury to her nose. She said that all the bruising and abrasions have completely healed without scarring and when I mentioned it was stated she had gross shock, she shrugged her shoulders and said she does not feel any currently symptoms of shock. She stated however occasionally she gets anxious about being in a bus and occasionally gets nightmares about having bus or car accidents but these have improved significantly.""

82Dr Maxwell went on to state:

""On examination, there was no shortening of her right leg. She demonstrated a pain-free range of movement of her right knee and right ankle. There is slight swelling in the mid-shaft of the tibia at the site of the fracture but this is not particularly tender. This was due to the callus formation. There is a 4cm vertical scar over the right knee which is very difficult to perceive, and three more scars on the lateral aspect of her right lower leg at the site of insertion of the cross screws, these were also difficult to perceive. The ligaments of the right knee were stable. Her right thigh measured 47cm and left 47.5cm. Her right calf measured 37cm and left 36cm.

She looked generally fitter and appears to have lost weight since my last examination. She now weights 70 kilograms.

DIAGNOSIS AND OPINION

Ms McLennan continues to recover. She has become more physically active and has lost weight. There is no significant muscle wasting in her right thigh indicating good function, and no loss of motion of her right knee or right ankle. She has no complaints in relation to the other alleged soft tissue injuries as a result of the bus accident. She has done a course to become a personal trainer and attends an outdoor gymnasium on an almost daily basis.""

83Dr Maxwell further stated:

""a. The history she gives, both in relation to her prior general physical condition, her onset of symptoms and the extent to which she relates his [sic] onset of symptoms to the injuries he [sic] alleges.

I have outlined the history in relation to her prior general physical condition, and the onset of her symptoms, and I have noted the extent to which she relates the onset of symptoms to the injuries she alleges. It should be noted that she has no symptoms in relation to the bus accident. Her residual minimal symptoms in relation to her right lower leg are due to the initial motor vehicle accident which occurred on 18 June 2009.

b. Her current medical condition and your opinion as to diagnosis.

She has some vague symptoms in relation to a loss of sensation in the right lower leg which comes on intermittently. It is difficult to prescribe a pathological cause for these symptoms.

c. Her capacity to work.

She is quite capable of working in an unlimited capacity as a gym instructor and as a personal trainer.""

84He described her prognosis as ""excellent"".

85Unlike Dr Bodel and Dr Conrad, Dr Maxwell does separate the two accidents, noting that, in his opinion, the plaintiff has ""very minimal residual disability with some discomfort after physical activity"" in relation to the first accident and no disability in relation to the second.

Conclusions concerning the medical evidence

86All of the evidence points to the plaintiff as having made a very good recovery from the fracture of her tibia. Her ability to work as a gymnast has continued.

87The highest Dr Bodel puts the plaintiff's problems are that she does not have the same ""skills set"" that she had prior to her injury, that she suffers pain, stiffness and swelling in the right leg at the fractured site, and that in the long term she will need to retrain in alternative duties. Dr Conrad opines that the plaintiff is able to continue with her present position as long as she does not do an excessive amount of work involving jumping on her right leg or an excessive amount of running. These views are contradicted by Dr Maxwell and by Dr Davé. For these reasons set out above, I have preferred the opinions of Dr Maxwell and Dr Davé.

Plaintiff's schedule of damages

88The plaintiff provided a schedule of damages as follows:





(a) Non Economic Loss

Nil


(b) Past out of pocket 

$4,002


(c) Future out of pocket

$10,000


(d) Past wage loss ($200 per week for 14 weeks)

$2,800


(e) Future loss of earning capacity

$100,000


(f) Future paid domestic assistance

$35,000


Total

$151,802

89The plaintiff falls below the threshold and no damages may be awarded for non-economic loss.

Past and future out of pocket expenses

90The past out of pocket expenses of $4,002 are agreed. The future out of pocket expenses relate principally to the cost of removal of the hardware inserted at the fracture site in the plaintiff's leg. At present, Dr Davé has indicated this is not necessary, but it is possible in the future.

91The removal of the pin is seen as a possibility, rather than an inevitability. In those circumstances, and taking into account the fact that the plaintiff is not currently seeking anything other than sporadic assistance with her ongoing concerns about her injuries in this accident, I am of the view that an allowance of $10,000 as a cushion for future out of pocket expenses is excessive. I would award the sum of $5,000.

Past wage loss

92Past wage loss of $200 per week for 14 weeks is claimed totalling $2,800. This figure is agreed by counsel for the defendant to be reasonable.

Future loss of earning capacity

93The task of assessing future economic loss in motor accident cases is governed by s 126 Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) which provides:

""126 Future economic loss-claimant's prospects and adjustments

(1) A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant's most likely future circumstances but for the injury.

(2) When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events concerned might have occurred but for the injury.

(3) If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted.""

94Section 126 is not a code which covers all aspects of the exercise, but one which involves the application of general law principles of assessment of damages: see Amoud v Al Batat (2009) 54 MVR 167 at [23]-[28] per Basten JA.

95The plaintiff in these proceedings, unlike the plaintiff in Amoud v Al Batat, supra, had no pre-injury, vulnerabilities or limitations. She was a fit and healthy young woman.

96The plaintiff's evidence about her pre-accident income was incorrect:

""Q. So, just so I understand it, at the time of the accident you had been working fulltime for a number of years?
A. Yes.

Q. Working fulltime for a number of years earning 600 a week at the YMCA?
A. Yes.

Q. So about 1200 a fortnight?
A. Yes.

Q. The fact was that your hours varied greatly in terms of the hours you were doing for week to week at the YMCA before the accident, didn't they?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. You say that you had been doing that 600 a week for some years. I want to suggest to you that's certainly not reflected in your tax returns is it?
A. No.

Q. If I can just ask you to assume that for the year ended 30 June, you understand the financial year, you put in tax returns for each financial year?
A. Yes.

Q. That for the year ended 30 June 2008 your gross income was 7396.
A. Yes.

Q. If you were earning 600 gross a week for that full financial year your gross income would be well over 25,000 a year, wouldn't it?
A. Yes.

Q. Why is it then that your tax returns only showed 7396 as your gross income?

HER HONOUR: This is for 2008?

FITZSIMMONS: Yes.

WITNESS: I may have my numbers wrong with my hours."" (T 34-35)

97The plaintiff was further cross-examined regarding the increase in her income subsequent to the accident in 2009:

""Q. The position was that by the year ended 30 June 2011 I suggest there had been a significant increase in your income, do you agree with that?
A. Yes.

Q. Can I simply put these figures to you, and again you may not remember them but I wanted to put them to you, according to your tax returns for the financial year ended 30 June 2008?
A. Yep.

Q. Your taxable income was 7,396. For the 30 June 2009 it went up to 11,383 although I want you to understand about 4,300 of that was Newstart?
A. Yes.

Q. Then for 30 June 2010 it was 10,526, do you understand?
A. Yes.

Q. But that included 2,430 of Newstart. Then what I want you to assume is by 30 June 2011, which was the full financial year just before this injury happened, your taxable income was up to 26,545?
A. Yes.

Q. Which included the sum of 1,586 of Newstart. So it appeared in terms of your actual income that your income had gone from roughly about $8,000 in terms of your actual income 30 June 2010 and you were up to your actual income excluding Newstart, about $25,000, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. That was from the work, the combined work that you were doing at the YMCA and also Belgravia, correct?
A. Yes."" (T 64)

98Counsel for the defendants pointed out that the plaintiff's income had in fact increased since she suffered the accident. I do not place very much weight on this, as that is not uncommon in cases involving young persons on the threshold of an adult earning career. Nevertheless, the onus lies on the plaintiff to prove loss of earning capacity: Kallouf v Middis [2008] NSWCA 61 at [68]-[93]. The court sets out at [89]-[90]:

""[89] Section 126, as Giles JA observed in The Nominal Defendant v Lane [2004] NSWCA 405 (at [61]) ""'enshrines in legislation the method for asserting an uncertain career path that was adopted in Norris v Blake (No 2)' [as] has been noted by Professor Luntz in Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death, 4th ed (2002) para 1.28 [sic, 11.2.8]"".

[90] The combined effect of s 126(1) and s 126(3) is to require the Court to identify and state the ""assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award [of damages for future economic loss] is to be based"", while s 126(1) requires satisfaction that these assumptions ""accord with the claimant's most likely future circumstances but for the injury"". Section 126(2) requires an adjustment of the ""amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions"" by reference to the ""percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury""; and s 126(3) requires the Court to state ""the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted"": Macarthur Districts Motor Cycle Sportsmen Inc v Ardizzone [2004] NSWCA 145 (at [3]) per Hodgson JA (Stein AJA agreeing); see also Bryson JA (at [52]) (speaking of s 13 of the Civil Liability Act which is in identical terms to s 126).""

99As counsel for the defendants pointed out at T 168, the plaintiff conceded she had returned to full duties and was in fact working longer hours than she had been before the accident. This included working all day and on some nights during special training camps. She has consistently reported to her doctors that she has returned to full gymnastic duties and the hours she was working demonstrate a capacity to perform those tasks she had been able to perform before the accident.

100Taking all of the medical evidence into account, I cannot be satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered any ongoing loss of earning capacity as a result of this accident. Having regard to the principles first enunciated in Graham v Baker (1961) 106 CLR 340, there is no evidence that any such loss of earning capacity would be productive of financial loss. The plaintiff has in fact demonstrated a capacity for hard physical work which indicates her recovery from the injuries suffered.

101The plaintiff's submission that she should be entitled to a cushion, even one of modest proportions, cannot detract from the plaintiff's obligation to establish that loss of capacity is likely to be productive of financial loss.

102I decline to make any award for future loss of earning capacity.

Future paid domestic assistance

103The plaintiff is a fit and healthy young woman whose complaints about housework are of a generalised nature in relation to vacuuming. Counsel for the defendants submits, and I accept, that for the plaintiff to have returned to the type of gymnastic work she has been doing while claiming she is not able effectively to participate in shared domestic chores is implausible (T 170). The evidence of the plaintiff's circumstances to date shows that in each of the domestic situations she has participated in, she has been able to perform domestic tasks herself without the need for assistance. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is no need for domestic assistance in the future given the degree to which the plaintiff has been able to carry out home duties since the accident. If I have erred in making this finding, I would not be satisfied that such assistance is likely to be sought on a commercial basis at some time in the future on the mere generalised evidence that the plaintiff would pay for such services if she was not able to call upon a spouse or other relative to perform them.

104The circumstances in which a claim for future paid commercial care in Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353 was permitted do not extend the principle of future paid domestic care to all cases where a plaintiff who is otherwise in good health and has a history such as the plaintiff states in the witness box that future paid care of some unspecified kind may be necessary in the future.

105The plaintiff's claim for future paid domestic assistance is not made out.

Summary of damages award





(a) Non Economic Loss

Nil


(b) Past out of pocket 

$4,002


(c) Future out of pocket

$2,800


(e) Future loss of earning capacity

Nil


(f) Future paid domestic assistance

Nil


Total

$11,802

Conclusion

106I gave judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $11,802. As this sum falls below the threshold in r 42.35 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) I have reserved the issue of costs.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff for $11,802.

(2)Costs reserved.

(3)Liberty to restore in 28 days.

(4)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		01 July 2014",2014-03-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763571,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 355,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR:  On the 28th day of the trial, Mr Spicer applied for an order that the present trial be discontinued against him and that in due course he be tried by another jury. The basis for that application is to be found in certain portions of the evidence given by his co-accused Ms Proud in the course of her cross-examination by Mr Steel. I dealt previously with an application by Mr Spicer with respect to Ms Proud's evidence in which Mr Spicer sought a discharge of the jury upon the basis that he was embarrassed by what she said about his role in the setting of the fire that killed the deceased: see R v Rawlinson [2014] NSWSC 329. I rejected that application.

2The evidence upon which Mr Spicer now relies is included in the material that follows:

""T1225 Q. The reality, Ms Proud, is that you are lying about this conversation? 
A. I'm not lying about the conversation. I know what took place in that motel that night and I know what he told me and what he did is sick. 

Q. I suggest to you that you are lying because you want to make the rest of your evidence sound believable? 
A. No, I'm not lying. I know what he said to me. He's sick.

...

T1227 Q. I suggest that yesterday, after court had finished sitting, that you made a comment, very loudly, to Mr Rawlinson in a position where Mr Spicer could hear, 'I'm only doing this for the kids. I don't care what happens to BJ' that's what you said, isn't it? 
A. No. 

Q. The reality is, isn't it, this evidence that you're giving about this conversation that supposedly happened when he returned home, you're giving that because you believe it will make the rest of your evidence more reliable or more believable? 
A. No, your client is a murderer. 

Q. And you're also doing it, I suggest, so that you can be in a position following this trial where you're able to care for your children? 
A. No. But my kids would always be number one to me. My kids are my world and I'm sitting in here because of something he did. 

Q. You're prepared to say whatever it takes, whether it's true or not, aren't you? 
A. No, I want to tell the truth of what he did, what he did to that poor woman.

...

T1228 Q. I suggest that you're prepared to lie if it will help you assist your children? 
A. No. 

Q. Even if that's at his expense, you're prepared to lie about things that weren't said? 
A. No, a murderer shouldn't walk free, a murderer should do their time. 

Q. You certainly didn't have that view when the police told you they needed the truth, did you? 
A. Because I was scared, he threatened to kill me too. He's done it once, he can do it again, he said to me. 

Q. You were in the custody of police officers? 
A. I don't care, I've lived with eight years of abuse from that bloke. 

Q. You knew there was a huge investigation going on; correct? 
A. I don't want to end up like Katie. 

Q. You did everything to assist him, didn't you, to not come to the police's attention; correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I suggest the reason you did that is not because of any threat by him to kill you; do you agree or disagree? 
A. He threatened me. 

Q. I suggest if that had really happened, you would have gone to the police? 
A. No, because the police can't save you all the time. Look at Katie. 

Q. You knew that the information that you had, if that was believed by the police, would take him into custody; you would have known that? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You would have known you would have been protected? 
A. How do I know that? How? At the time how do I know my family is protected when you've got him threatening the Rebels on you all the time? 

...

T1229 Q. You made no enquiries of the police whatsoever to see if they could protect you, did you? 
A. No. 

Q. This is just another convenient lie to explain why your evidence is in court is inconsistent with - 
A. No, your client is just a liar all the time, a compulsive liar. He always has been, he always will be. He always has been when he's been charged by police and always lied his way out of those too.

...

T1235 Q. And that on that particular morning BJ said to you that he was taking the car to go to work and he was doing scrapping; right? 
A. No. Why would he use the sedan for scrapping? 

Q. To take him to work? 
A. He wasn't working at the time. He was on parole and he wasn't working.

...

T1238-39 Q. You are saying that's what Wendy told you; is that a lie or is that the truth? 
A. I can't remember what Wendy had told me. 

Q. That's what you are telling the police there that Wendy had told you; you accept that? 
A. Well, then I have to be mistaken with that. 

Q. When you say 'mistaken', are you saying you are mistaken that that's what Wendy told you? 
A. I don't know, I was listening to a conversation those two were having on the phone, laughing it up what they frigging did. 

Q. You had a conversation on the pay phone? 
A. That conversation didn't take place over the pay phone. That conversation took place at home. 

Q. (Witness shown exhibit AAAS). Please have a read of question 517 and the answer. The relevant part is down the bottom on page 52. 
A. (Witness complied). Yes. 

Q. You agree now, don't you, that that is a conversation that you are saying you had with Wendy on the pay phone on that very day, correct? 
A. No, I'm saying that's a conversation I had Friday and underneath I'm going on about another conversation I had at home. That's where I'm trying to tell the police what she had told me at home. 

Q. So that's what she told you, it is not a conversation between her and BJ, is it? 
A. Yes, they had a conversation, on either the Saturday or Sunday, laughing up on the phone what they did to her, talking about how funny it was going in there lighting the fire, pouring the petrol around the bed. Real funny. 

Q. You didn't tell the police that? 
A. No.""

3The principal matters upon which Mr Spicer relies are twofold. First Mr Spicer contends that he has been irreparably and unfairly prejudiced by Ms Proud's reference to his having been on parole at a particular time as a reason why he was not then working. Secondly, Mr Spicer submits that Ms Proud's references to him always lying his way out of charges on previous occasions gives rise to a not dissimilar but equally prejudicial inference that he has been regularly in trouble with the police for which he has faced the prospect of being charged. Mr Spicer contends that this reference to his actual or inferential criminal past is material to which the jury should not have been exposed, and that in the circumstances it creates an impression of him that is both prejudicial and incapable of correction by any appropriate direction or warning.

4It is timely to observe that this material was revealed at a point in the trial when Ms Proud had already given the evidence that prompted the earlier application to which I have referred. It is uncontroversial that Ms Proud's evidence of Mr Spicer's admission to her significantly, if not entirely, confounded the basis of his defence to the Crown case, which was that he had been unaware of the presence of the deceased in the bedroom when he participated in setting the fire that killed her. It followed quite reasonably that Mr Spicer's counsel should thereafter attempt, within the confines of his instructions, to discredit Ms Proud in order to limit if possible the damaging effect of her evidence about Mr Spicer's admission.

5Equally reasonably, Ms Proud would appear to have responded to the pressure of cross-examination by turning her attention to Mr Spicer. I accept immediately that whatever may have been the genesis for her outbursts, it is irrelevant for present purposes. What is relevant in this context is the Crown's submission that, to the extent that Ms Proud was attempting to shore up or resurrect her own credibility, it was a natural and not unexpected product of questions put to her by counsel for Mr Spicer and should not, for at least that reason, be considered as material that is unfairly prejudicial to him.

6It should not pass without comment that there was little to be found in the substance of what Ms Proud said that directly assists her own position in this trial. For example, characterising Mr Spicer as an associate of bikies, as a violent man who treated her badly or physically abused her and who even threatened to kill her to keep her silent, or as a person who callously conversed with Ms Evans in humorous terms about the death of the deceased, does little to establish that Ms Proud was criminally unconcerned with it. To like effect, characterising Mr Spicer as ""sick"" or calling him a ""murderer"" who should do his time or a ""compulsive liar"" are matters that are wholly irrelevant to her own culpability. On the contrary, whether taken in isolation or in combination, the effect upon Mr Spicer is negative in every respect and prejudicial to him in the proceedings. 

7I also consider that the material complained of is unfairly prejudicial to Mr Spicer. At one level this is so simply because it paints Mr Spicer in a particularly negative light. It must remain in considerable doubt whether the jury could be expected to put such lurid material out of their minds in considering the question of his guilt. 

8The more obvious and fundamental reason why the material is unfairly prejudicial appears to me to be because it has had, or might be taken to have had, a direct and profound effect upon Mr Spicer's decision about whether or not to give evidence in his trial. At one level Mr Spicer was faced with the prospect that if he stayed away from the witness box, he would be left to confront the inevitable inference that his failure to counter Ms Proud's evidence, that he admitted what he had done to the deceased, would or could be treated as an acceptance that what she said was true. However, in the events that occurred, Ms Proud's additional evidence significantly complicated that decision to the extent that it required Mr Spicer to decide in addition whether he should or should not give evidence to meet the series of additional and extraneous allegations made about him. At a forensic level, that placed Mr Spicer in a potentially intolerable position because he would necessarily thereby expose himself to cross-examination by the Crown about his alleged admission as the price of attempting to establish that he was none of the other irrelevant things that Ms Proud said he was. In the case of his criminal record and status as a person on parole, the situation is even worse insofar as Mr Spicer would presumably never have been able to neutralise such evidence because it is true but should never have been mentioned. 

9But there is to my mind an even more compelling reason why what has occurred should lead to the separation of Mr Spicer's trial. Up until the time that Ms Proud gave the evidence that Mr Spicer had confessed to a significantly greater involvement in the death of the deceased than he had until then conceded, there arguably remained scope for him to maintain the position that his knowledge of the presence of the deceased was either nonexistent or limited. Ms Proud's evidence was on one readily available view wholly destructive of that position. However, the evidence was never part of the original Crown case against Mr Spicer but fell unexpectedly from a witness about whose other evidence the jury would have had extensively to be warned. In such circumstances there arises the distinct but untestable prospect that the jury might improperly disregard a judicial warning about some parts of Ms Proud's evidence because they wished to endorse and utilise the otherwise apparently compelling evidence given by her about Mr Spicer's alleged admission. Such an exercise carries with it the risk that the jury might illegitimately fail to take into account in Mr Spicer's favour the potentially important and detrimental effect upon Ms Proud's credibility, which the cross-examination of Ms Proud upon the areas that the jury is being asked simultaneously to disregard could have produced. As tortured or even as unlikely as that path or line of reasoning might appear to be, its mere possibility raises the spectre of irremediable prejudice to Mr Spicer.

10It was for these reasons that I somewhat reluctantly ordered that the trial of Mr Spicer should be separated from the trial of his co-accused.

11Mr Spicer's application provoked similar applications by Mr Rawlinson and Ms Proud. Mr Rawlinson contended that the evidence from Ms Proud, suggesting Mr Spicer was an unsavoury and distasteful character with a violent predisposition and a criminal history, would have the effect of tainting Mr Rawlinson by association. As appears clear, Mr Rawlinson was involved in arranging for someone to carry out his plan at least to harm the deceased if not more than that. There is powerful evidence that he deposited money into a TAB account of a woman closely connected to Mr Spicer and that Mr Spicer received it. It is equally apparent that Mr Spicer carried out an act together with Wendy Evans that led to the death of the deceased. Mr Rawlinson's concern is to maintain as much distance as he can from the insalubrious aspects of Mr Spicer's past.

12Mr Rawlinson's concerns appear to me to be the result of an unrealistic sensitivity. There is a wealth of evidence from which the jury could reason that Mr Spicer performed or participated in the act that killed the deceased and that he did so at Mr Rawlinson's bidding. How that evidence ultimately translates in terms of the jury's verdict remains to be seen. However, it is a little difficult to see that Mr Rawlinson is unfairly prejudiced just because Mr Spicer's actions at 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal have a tendency to support or confirm Ms Proud's phlegmatic opinions about him. It would be surprising in the extreme if Mr Rawlinson had been able to solicit the services of anyone of good repute or unblemished character to do what Mr Spicer did. The outcome in Mr Rawlinson's trial is more likely to be swamped by considerations of what he did or did not do than by reference to the character and antecedents of some person he is alleged to have employed to achieve his objectives.

13Ms Proud is in an even weaker position. She chose to give the very evidence that has caused Mr Spicer's trial to miscarry. It lies ill in her mouth in my view to protest about the effect that what has occurred may have upon the jury's assessment of her credibility when she is the author of her own destiny in that respect. I perceive plainly that no unfair prejudice to Ms Proud has arisen in the circumstances.

		09 December 2014",2014-03-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763585,R v Pratten (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 396,"JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: Timothy Charles Pratten was charged, tried and convicted of seven counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by deception, contrary to s 134.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”). Each charge relates to a taxation return filed for one of the seven years ending 30 June 2003 through to 30 June 2009.
	
	
	The Crown case was that Mr Pratten obtained financial advantages by filing tax returns that he knew understated his taxable income and he did that by deceiving the Commonwealth as to his income for the purpose of receiving a financial advantage.
	
	
	Mr Pratten pleaded not guilty to each charge. The jury trial was heard over a three-month period (not including interlocutory proceedings) and the jury returned its verdict on 13 June 2012. Prior to the hearing of the sentence proceedings, Mr Pratten launched a collateral attack (“the civil proceedings”) on the initiating and investigative process, challenging the conduct of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The collateral attack was based predominantly on constitutional and administrative grounds.
	
	
	The parties accepted that the civil proceedings may be affected if the Court would impose a sentence. Accordingly, the sentence proceedings were adjourned until after the civil proceedings concluded. The civil proceedings were dismissed by me on 21 May 2013.
	
	
	The substantive hearing of the sentence proceedings commenced on 28 March 2013, and concluded with written submissions on delayed psychiatric reports, which written submissions of the Crown and Mr Pratten were dated 29 August 2013. There were some inconsequential submissions made by Mr Pratten thereafter (at which time, I understand, he was not legally represented in these proceedings).
	
	
	An appeal against the judgment in the civil proceedings had been lodged. Because of the conceded effect any sentence imposed would have on the appeal, I held up the imposition of the sentence. There had been no application for expedition of the appeal. After six months, I caused an enquiry to be made of the Registry, at which point it came to my attention, for the first time, that the appeal had been discontinued in December 2013, just prior to its allocated hearing.
	
	
	It is unfortunate that there is no requirement on the parties to inform a trial judge of the withdrawal of any such appeal. The foregoing is not a criticism of the parties. It is the process of the Court that should organise such notice. Nevertheless, the imposition of a sentence has been delayed. That delay is, as to one third of it, the result of the submission on behalf of Mr Pratten as to the relationship between the civil and sentencing proceedings, but the period between December 2013 and now, nor before May 2013, cannot be attributed to any conduct of Mr Pratten. In any event, Mr Pratten, during the whole period between being discharged and arrested (except 8 days) has been subject to quite stringent bail applications.
	
	
	I turn then to the sentencing exercise. Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000.00. Mr Pratten has spent eight days in custody and, apart from those eight days, been the subject of conditional liberty since being charged.
	
	
	The Court is bound to apply the sentencing regime prescribed by the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”), and in particular, when arriving at an appropriate sentence, to impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the offence. In that regard, the Court is required to take into account, where relevant, the considerations prescribed by s 16A of the Act.
	
	
	While it is necessary to have regard to and apply consistency in sentencing, such consistency is obtained through consistency in the application of legal principle (including the requirements of the Act, and to the extent applicable, the common law) not the mechanical or arithmetic application of other sentences imposed on other offenders.
	


The nature and circumstance of the offence


	
	The conduct that gives rise to these seven offences arises out of one continuing course of conduct (see s 16A(2)(c) of the Act), being the arrangements for business affairs and receipt of income of Mr Pratten. That this is one continuing course of conduct is evidenced by two prime examples.
	
	
	First, apart from the identity of the trust accounts that were the source of payments to Mr Pratten, the Crown case depended on a consistent approach to the receipt (and payment) of money without regard to any suggested change from one year to another.
	
	
	Secondly, Mr Pratten's tax returns, which form the basis for the Crown's allegations of dishonesty, deception and financial advantage, were lodged on three occasions: two of them in August 2005; one of them in June 2006; and four of them in September 2009.
	
	
	The Crown case, and the criminal conduct, does not involve the forging of false invoices or the compilation of false books or the like. The payments to Mr Pratten were largely payments made from Vanuatu trust accounts, without any attempt to conceal payments made directly to him. Different issues arise as to certain third party payments, which I will shortly address.
	
	
	It is necessary to set out the conduct and its effect. I will try to be brief. Nevertheless, apart from three months of oral testimony, there are over 200 exhibits, mostly consisting of volumes of documents or schedules of financial transactions. As a consequence, the following is necessarily general and a little simplistic. The issues associated with the following will be dealt with later.
	
	
	As part of the investigation of Project Wickenby, alleged discrepancies were found in payments out of two trust account companies. The companies were Vanuatu International Trust Company (VITCO) and International Financial Trust Company (IFTCO). Each of those companies operated in relation to relevant transactions in different years. The details of the years of those operations are largely irrelevant in determining either objective culpability, or the seriousness of the offence, or the subjective circumstances of Mr Pratten.
	
	
	Both IFTCO and VITCO were, it seems, operated by an accounting firm or firms, the principals of which included Mr Robert Agius. The evidence is that Mr Robert Agius was described as ""a principal backer, a principal player"" in the establishment of an insurance company in Vanuatu, and at other times as ""its head"". The company was initially called Rural and General International Insurance Limited (RGII) and later changed its name to Commercial Pacific Insurance Limited (CPI). I will refer to the company as CPI.
	
	
	I do not accept as proved, either on the balance of probabilities or beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Pratten was a principal of CPI. Any evidence suggesting that proposition, whether directly or indirectly, is weak and is not accepted. Of course the evidence raises a significant suspicion of that fact, but it does not allow the Court to travel beyond suspicion.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I do accept that Mr Pratten was to receive 25% of the profit of CPI on its winding up, which was to occur, absent extension, within 10 years of its formation. CPI was formed in 2002 after alterations to the minimum conditions that an Australian company was required to satisfy in order to offer insurance. The Crown did not adduce evidence, during sentencing proceedings, that Mr Pratten received 25% of the profit at any time during 2012.
	
	
	Up until 2002, Mr Pratten was the major shareholder in an insurance company, Rural and General Insurance Limited (RGIL). Other than grandfathering prior policies, RGIL ceased operating in July 2002. After the requirements were altered, Mr Pratten established an insurance brokerage, Rural and General Insurance Broking Limited (RGIB). Mr Pratten was the major shareholder of RGIB through another company, of which he was sole director and shareholder, namely, 71 Cowper Street Holdings Pty Limited.
	
	
	During the whole period relevant to these charges, Mr Pratten received a salary from either or both RGIL and/or RGIB. RGIB brokered insurance to CPI (and, during some of the period, other insurers).
	
	
	The evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Pratten performed work from which CPI benefited.
	
	
	RGIB collected premiums for CPI and remitted them to Vanuatu. There is no suggestion that RGIB did not withhold the appropriate level of tax before paying Australian source income to an overseas entity. Further, there is no suggestion that either RGIL or RGIB failed to deduct the appropriate amounts of tax from Mr Pratten's salary, and remit those amounts to the Australian Tax Office (ATO).
	
	
	To complicate matters further, Mr Pratten owned or controlled various companies, and together with his daughters, was a beneficiary of a family trust. One of the companies was the trustee, of the family trust. Mr Pratten's business structure (or structures) was (or were) not uncomplicated. The overwhelming impression from the trial, and tracing the payments of money, is that Mr Pratten was insufficiently strict, or particular, in differentiating between transactions for each of the different entities, and also between the entities and his own personal affairs.
	
	
	The Crown did not adduce evidence that any of the companies owned or controlled by Mr Pratten did not pay sufficient tax. Further, the Crown did not adduce any evidence that the Pratten Family Trust did not pay sufficient tax. Moreover, the Crown did not prove that the amounts by which it alleged Mr Pratten understated his income were not declared as income by, or otherwise on the books of, one or other of Mr Pratten's related entities (that is, the aforesaid companies or trust). If it were possible that all of the income was declared by one of those entities, or a combination of them, there would seem to be an hypothesis consistent with innocence of these charges.
	
	
	Nevertheless, Mr Pratten has been found guilty of the offences, and I am bound by that finding. Therefore I am required to sentence on the basis that for each relevant year some amounts, known to be income, were deliberately omitted from the tax returns by Mr Pratten, thereby dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage from the Commonwealth by deception.
	
	
	Mr Pratten had control of RGIB, and operated his Australian business through RGIB, which in turn had a business relationship with CPI. The Crown has proved, as earlier stated, that Mr Pratten performed work from which CPI benefited. This work included insurance broking, arranging reinsurance, performing training, and other ancillary functions. The Crown alleged at trial (and on sentence) that some of this work was rewarded by CPI from its accounts in Vanuatu, held at IFTCO and VITCO, to Mr Pratten or at his direction.
	
	
	The Crown case was that the payments from IFTCO and VITCO were payments to Mr Pratten or for his benefit for the work done. I directed the jury in the summing-up that it would need to be sure that the money from IFTCO and VITCO was the money of CPI, and that no other reasonable hypothesis exists. The jury were also informed that, as the Crown put its case, they had to be sure that CPI paid the money to Mr Pratten, or at his direction, because he performed work for them.
	
	
	In that regard, the jury had to be sure that Mr Pratten performed the work, or provided the services, in his personal capacity, and not in his capacity as a director of RGIB or the trustee company or any other entity. If hypotheses were available, on the evidence accepted, that either the money was not that of CPI, or was not paid for services provided by Mr Pratten in his personal capacity, or both, then the Crown has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The jury convicted. At least some of the money, paid from the accounts in IFTCO and VITCO emanate, on the jury's finding, from CPI, and were paid for services by Mr Pratten in his personal capacity.
	
	
	Early in the trial, the Court summarised the Crown case by seven fundamental propositions:
	



	
	Moneys (including payments of expenses) “the disputed amounts” were paid to Mr Pratten, or for his benefit, by various entities at Mr Pratten's direction;
	
	
	The disputed amounts were income in the ordinary meaning of that term, and Mr Pratten was required to declare the disputed amounts as income in his personal tax returns;
	
	
	Mr Pratten did not declare the disputed amounts in his personal tax returns;
	
	
	These disputed amounts were not declared in order to deceive the Commonwealth;
	
	
	The ATO issued tax assessments on the basis of the declared lower income;
	
	
	The tax assessments were lower than they otherwise would have been;
	
	
	As a consequence, Mr Pratten gained a financial advantage, and he did so by deception.
	



	
	At the time, the Court was informed only propositions (2) and (4) above were truly in issue. That information was not completely accurate. Proposition (1) was in issue, although not accurately, or clearly, identified on behalf of the accused, in that it was in issue that all of the disputed amounts were for the benefit of Mr Pratten in his personal capacity, and it was disputed that Mr Pratten gave the directions in his personal capacity.
	
	
	Whatever the ultimate amount, the Crown has not proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Pratten did any more than implement a scheme, planned and organised by Vanuatu accountants. The amounts, however, are large.
	
	
	The Crown claims that the income that was not declared totals $5,009,722.63 for which Mr Pratten received a financial advantage of $2,277,003.00 (being the tax shortfall).
	
	
	The Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt the full extent of the foregoing amounts. It is necessary to break the foregoing into years. For 2003, the Crown alleges undeclared income of $1,068,706.00 and a tax benefit $518,322.00.
	
	
	For 2004, the Crown alleged undeclared income of $275,367.00 and a tax benefit $133,513.00. For 2005, the undeclared income was $332,490.51 and the tax benefit was $160,865.00. For 2006, undeclared income equalled $995,401.59, for which the tax benefit was $475,987.00. For 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Crown alleged undeclared income of $1,381,207.11, $822,382.42, and $134,168.00 respectively, for which the tax benefit was $633,017.00, $330,305.00 and $24,993.00 respectively.
	
	
	The Crown has not proved, to the requisite standard, that the foregoing amounts, which include third party payments and loans, were all income derived by Mr Pratten, and dishonestly and by deception not disclosed to the ATO. I have included a schedule of those transactions, which, notwithstanding the jury's verdict, were not proved by the Crown to the requisite standard to be Mr Pratten's personal income that he deliberately and dishonestly did not declare in order to deceive the Commonwealth to obtain a financial disadvantage.
	
	
	The amounts represent transactions for which there exists a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt. The reasonable hypothesis goes to the nature of the transaction. The jury verdict, and the manner in which the issues were put to the jury, would prevent the Court, in this exercise, finding reasonable hypotheses going to the source of the income, or whether Mr Pratten personally performed services for CPI.
	
	
	The net result is that the Crown allegations include payments to third parties and amounts that have not been proved to be anything other than loans. Neither category has been proved by the Crown to be income in the hands of Mr Pratten, that should have been (or, more accurately, that he knew should have been) declared as his income.
	
	
	The amounts by which the income is to be reduced, therefore, totals $2,235,065.96, being $727,325.33 in 2003, $198,272.00 in 2004, $242,679.41 in 2005, $350,792.42 in 2006, $381,516.70 in 2007, $296,580.10 in 2008, and $37,900.00 in 2009. As a consequence, to the extent that the amounts involve assessment of culpability, I find for the purposes of sentencing that a total amount of $2,960,577.04 was income, of which $2,774,658.00 was undeclared, providing a financial advantage of approximately $1,252,324.00 being the tax that was not paid. I have not tried to calculate accurately the tax that would be payable on those amounts, as it is sufficient to have a general indication.
	
	
	The foregoing does not take account of the deductions that may have been available, but I accept that while it may affect tax payable, it has little effect on the assessment of objective seriousness. It is the level of dishonesty that one is examining: R v Boughen; R v Cameron (2012) 215 A Crim R 476; [2012] NSWCCA 17 per Simpson J at [56] to [57].
	
	
	The Crown case created significant artificiality. I do not say that by way of criticism. It sought to include only income in the ordinary sense, without statutory enlargement of that term. I understand the reasons why the Crown would see that as appropriate, but as a consequence, some loans or distributions of trust that are statutorily included in taxable income, were not addressed on that basis. Instead, the Crown sought to prove that the payments were ordinary income, as that is understood.
	
	
	As earlier stated, I do not consider that Mr Pratten was other than an implementer of a scheme presented to him. Certainly the contrary has not been proved by the Crown to the requisite standard. Nevertheless, the scheme was implemented over a number of years, requiring three separate episodes of dishonest acts. The nature and quality of the acts did not differ substantially, and again, as has been stated, this was one course of continuing conduct, implemented on three occasions for seven years’ returns.
	
	
	However, I accept that the scheme or arrangement was dishonest from its inception.
	
	
	In dealing with the seriousness of the offences arising from deliberately lodging dishonest tax returns, in R v Glyn Morgan Jones; R v Anthony Joseph Luis Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108, I said (McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreeing):
	


“[13] Of late, procedures for the filing of income tax returns have been relaxed and much greater emphasis has been placed upon self-assessment. Such a process reposes on the taxpayer a heavy duty of honesty. The practical restrictions on the capacity of government to apprehend offenders for every offence necessarily requires that the legislature and the courts ensure that deceitful conduct, in a commercial enterprise, once discovered, is appropriately punished. Deterrence looms large.

[14] While the analogy is not always appropriate, there is much to be said for the applicability of statements relating to customs duty to offences of this kind. In that regard, I repeat the oft quoted passage from Kitto J in L. Vogel and Son Pty. Ltd. v Anderson, Minister of State for Customs and Excise for the Commonwealth of Australia [1968] HCA 90; (1967) 120 CLR 157 at 164:

“The duty evaded has now been paid, and I understand that when the evasions were discovered the defendants gave the Customs every assistance in their investigations. But when all the considerations relied upon by the defendants have been given due attention the case still cannot be regarded as other than a serious one. Not only are the defendants guilty of a sustained course of conscious wrongdoing, but the offences are in a field in which punishments for deliberate offences must be severe. The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organization of the community, and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of frauds is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with the Customs, but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The Customs Act makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact, for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weight the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile.”

See also DPP (Cth) v Goldberg (2001) VSCA 107.


	
	I do not accept, to the requisite standard, that the Crown has proved that Mr Pratten's change in accountants was for reasons of dishonesty. He informed his accountant of an interest in CPI, and he was provided advice that it did not require declarations to the ATO. There are numerous reasons, some raised during the course of the trial, for changing accountants.
	
	
	Mr Pratten has shown no remorse for the offences in question. Further, there has been no co-operation with the Australian Federal Police or ATO in relation to these matters.
	
	
	However, as may be obvious from earlier comments, the degree of “co-operation” by Mr Pratten at trial was extraordinary. There was little or no objection to any documents, and there was co-operation to minimise the issues. The length of the trial, and the number and complexity of exhibits, was the Crown's choice. Again, I make no criticism in that regard. Most of them were agreed, and Mr Pratten's conduct of the trial is a matter I take into account to his credit, albeit that the Court is not a ""law enforcement agency"", but not significantly to his credit.
	


Sentencing


	
	The principles of sentencing are well-known. In white-collar crimes more than most, general deterrence plays a significant role. Unlike crimes committed on the spur of the moment, most white-collar crimes are planned and embarked upon after weighing advantages and disadvantages. This is no exception. Nevertheless, the principles are clear.
	
	
	Sentencing is an intuitive process. Sentencing involves the resolution of conflicting goals, protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. These goals overlap and cannot be considered in isolation from each other. Often they point in different directions (see Veen v R (No 2) [1988] 164 CLR 465 at 476).
	
	
	Nevertheless, sentencing must remain an intuitive process.
	
	
	I have so far taken into account those relevant factors prescribed in s 16A of the Act, except the need for adequate punishment, and the subjective circumstances of the offender. The former is manifest. I deal with the latter below.
	


Sentence Factors


	
	Mr Pratten was born in Sydney in 1960. He has one sibling, his parents are both deceased. He was married in 1995 and separated in 2000, seemingly as a result of the effects of his wife's post-natal depression. Mr Pratten's two daughters are estranged from their mother, and Mr Pratten is their only available carer.
	
	
	Their welfare and state of health was the subject of evidence.
	
	
	There are reports of 25 March 2013 and 10 July 2013, from the psychologist, relating, amongst other things, to Mr Pratten and the effect of his potential incarceration on his daughters. Those reports are from Mr Watson Munro. I accept those reports, and I accept that hardship caused to Mr Pratten's two daughters is in this case an exceptional circumstance, warranting consideration in mitigation of sentence, and/or in determining the type of sentence to be imposed: R v Maslin (1995) 79 A Crim R 119; R v Yeung Lo [2004] NSWCCA 382.
	
	
	Mr Pratten himself has high levels of depression and anxiety, and will find it very difficult to cope in a custodial environment. He requires intensive and regular psychiatric or psychological treatment of a kind that is generally unavailable in the prison system.
	
	
	Mr Pratten has no criminal record other than offences arising from this conduct, or ancillary to it, namely, failure to file tax returns at a time during or after the conduct here in question.
	


Conclusion


	
	Notwithstanding the Crown's submission, I do not consider this case anywhere near the higher end of the range of objective seriousness for the offences he committed. The provisions under which Mr Pratten was charged is not a tax offence, and may involve very serious fraud.
	
	
	Further, Mr Pratten did not engage in the falsifying of any documents, nor in my view did he plan this scheme. At least the Crown has not proved it to the requisite standard. In my view his culpability is at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	His subjective factors, in which I include his attitude at his trial to an insignificant degree, are important. His own health is precarious, the effects of incarceration on his daughters is significant, and the circumstances sufficiently exceptional to warrant their consideration.
	
	
	There are three separate episodes of filing false returns. Further, Mr Pratten has been on conditional liberty just on three years, and spent eight days in custody. Taking account of the fact that some part of his conditional liberty was longer because of his civil action, I allow approximately one third of the time on bail as a period of incarceration: Renshaw v R [2012] NSWCCA 91.
	
	
	I am mindful of the provisions of s 17A of the Act, and in particular, that imprisonment is the last option, to be imposed only when no other sentence is appropriate. I consider these offences sufficiently serious to warrant some custodial sentence. I pay particular regard to general deterrence. I do not consider specific deterrence to be a significant factor.
	
	
	For Counts 1 and 2, committed in 2005, I fix 500 hours of community service. For Count 3, committed in 2006, I fix 250 hours of community service. For Counts, 4, 5, 6 and 7, I fix a sentence of 3 years’ and six months’ imprisonment. I adjust the starting date by 12 months’ to take account of conditional liberty and prior incarceration.
	
	
	I also take account of the exceptional subjective issues, to which I have referred, for which I allow an extended period on parole.
	


Sentence

Mr Pratten,


	
	For the 1st and 2nd offence on the indictment, you are convicted and you are sentenced to 500 hours of community service.
	
	
	For the 3rd offence on the indictment, you are convicted and you are sentenced to 250 hours of community service.
	
	
	For the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th offences on the indictment you are convicted and you are sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years’ and 6 months’, commencing 31 March 2013, to be released after 18 months’ on entering a recognizance of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for 24 months’.

		29 April 2016",2014-03-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763586,R v Nguon & Ream [2014] NSWDC 385,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Linna Nguon and Peter Ream, stand trial on an indictment dated 3 June 2013 on one count each of attempted possession of a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs, allegedly being cocaine and methamphetamine.
	
	
	The accused were arrested on 4 November 2011, along with 2 alleged co-offenders, at a warehouse at Newton St in Wetherill Park. The alleged co-offenders are Ben Faulkner and another man identified in these proceedings only as DB.
	
	
	DB pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and was sentenced by Judge Norrish QC in or about April 2013. He gave evidence on the committal and it is proposed that he will give evidence in the Crown case in the present trial.
	
	
	In broad summary, the Crown case is as follows. In or about late October a quantity of drugs, being approximately 24 kgs of cocaine and 27 kgs of methamphetamine were detected by authorities concealed in a tractor grapple bucket which had been consigned to a Fafiro Keo, who the evidence suggests is an associate of Ben Faulkner, from an address in Vancouver in Canada. The drugs were seized and replaced with an alternate, benign, substance and a listening device was also installed inside the grapple bucket, which was resealed so as to conceal the fact that it had been intercepted. The grapple bucket was then released from customs and was collected by Keo in a truck which had been hired by the accused Nguon from Camden Hire on 1 November 2011. The bucket was eventually transported to the warehouse in Wetherill Park. The truck was returned to Camden Hire by the accused Nguon on 4 November.
	
	
	It is alleged that during the course of the afternoon of 4 November, the 4 co-offenders were all present from time to time at the warehouse. There were some comings and goings, but all four are said to have been present at the premises for a large proportion of the relevant time. Throughout that time, the warehouse was under police surveillance. That surveillance consisted primarily of a concealed video camera, located opposite the entrance to the warehouse, and the listening device which had earlier been installed in the grapple bucket.
	
	
	The principal product of the surveillance was 3 mp4 files which resulted from the simultaneous recording of the video footage from the concealed camera and the audio signal transmitted from the listening device which had been hidden within the grapple bucket. The recording was tendered on the voir dire and played in court and is exhibit VD J.
	
	
	The audio quality of that recording is poor. It picks up some of the conversation of those present at the warehouse that afternoon, a great deal of which, though audible, is indecipherable. Indeed, so much of it is indecipherable that it is frequently impossible to confidently attribute a proper context to some of what is discernible. Furthermore, the audio quality and the discernibility of the recorded speech is adversely affected by a variety of other factors. First, there is a multitude of what might reasonably be described as industrial sounds which are recorded, such as hammering, banging, drilling, motors starting and running and so on. Secondly, there are recorded sounds apparently emanating from a radio or television, possibly both, playing in the background. Thirdly, there is electrical or other interference which seems at times to disturb and break up the signal being transmitted from the hidden listening device. Fourthly, the warehouse is a large open space with a lot of hard surfaces and there is a degree of consequent reverberation. Fifthly, the voices heard on the recording are more or less audible at different times and it is reasonable to infer that each individual is moving around and is at different times more or less proximate to the listening device. An additional complication in sensibly analysing the content of the recording is that it appears that the hidden listening device is picking up sounds not only from within the warehouse where it is located inside the grapple bucket, but also from adjoining units in the complex within which the warehouse was located.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the poor quality of the recording and the problems with it that I have outlined, there is sufficient discernible from the recording to effectively provide some corroboration of the evidence of DB concerning who was present and what was occurring in the warehouse that afternoon. It is abundantly clear, even on only one listening, that four people are present at the warehouse that afternoon and four distinct voices are heard at different times. It is also plain that considerable co-operative effort, predominantly on the part of the 3 males, was being directed to trying to gain access to the interior of the grapple bucket.
	
	
	Tara Beckett, an officer of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), was at all material times the case officer for operation Copia, which was the police investigation into activities connected with the importation of the tractor grapple bucket. It seems the case officer is the AFP officer with the principal day to day carriage of an investigation, under the supervision of a team leader. For all practical purposes, Ms Beckett was the AFP officer in charge of the investigation.
	
	
	On about 18 November 2011, Ms Beckett sent the 3 mp4 files from the surveillance of the warehouse to a Mr Graham Kinraid, who is currently employed within the AFP as Team Leader, Planning, Deployment and Systems but who was, at the relevant time in the position of Team Leader, in the AFP Audio-Visual Laboratory. His role involved working with, and supervising, a team of 2 others in audio and video signal processing. That is, using their training, skill and experience, with the aid a variety of technical equipment, to make recorded material playable in a common format or to provide some analysis or enhancement to improve its quality.
	
	
	The request that Ms Beckett made of Mr Kinraid was in essence a request for him to “enhance” the audio recording from the surveillance. Mr Kinraid understood that what he was being asked to do was to make a general assessment of the audio files and come up with a solution intended to improve the quality of the audio, or the “listenability” as he described it. In more precise terms, the instructions which he said he received were to enhance the audio from the device in the warehouse in order to ascertain the involvement and discussion of all parties in the warehouse, paying particular attention to the female voice.
	
	
	Mr Kinraid, who has qualifications as a radio technician and an engineering certificate, and many years experience in this work in Australia and New Zealand, prepared two statements and gave additional oral evidence explaining the nature of his efforts in “enhancing” the audio recording from the surveillance. Those statements, dated 17 September 2013 and 18 March 2014 are marked Exhibits VD K and VD L respectively. After he received the mp4 files from Ms Beckett, Mr Kinraid changed their format from mp4, which is a combined audio-visual file format, to a .wav file. Files in the .wav format are much larger files, thus apparently facilitating their manipulation, which are playable on most computers and compatible with the equipment in his section’s laboratory. He then transferred those files to the laboratory’s digital file storage, access to which is restricted to members of his team, so that he could work on them. The work that Mr Kinraid undertook was performed in the days leading up to 22 November 2011, at which time he emailed to Ms Beckett the product of his efforts, being the 3 .wav files that constitute what has been called the enhanced audio (Ex VD M).
	
	
	The “enhancement” which Mr Kinraid achieved involved the digital manipulation of the audio files, in particular by the application of four different filters. The idea of the application of the filters is generally to reduce some of the sounds that may be masking conversations or otherwise making it difficult to hear those conversations. The selection of appropriate filters, from a range of tools that might be used, was done by a process of analysis of the problems that Mr Kinraid discerned with the unenhanced audio files.
	
	
	The first filter which was applied to the audio file is called a de-click filter. A de-click filter is a computer algorithm which analyses a digital audio file to locate clicks and remedy their deleterious effect on the quality of the audio. A click is represented by very sharp rise times in the wave form of the sound, disturbing the otherwise smooth wave form. These clicks usually denote something in the nature of electrical interference rather than a natural phenomon such as speech or music. After locating clicks, the de-click filter seemingly smooths out the wave form, replacing the sharp rise with a continuous wave. Mr Kinraid said that the filter does not diminsh or affect speech.
	
	
	The second filter applied by Mr Kinraid was an adaptive filter. It can be used in a number of different ways, but in this instance was used to try and ameliorate the large amount of reverberation that was present as a result of the listening device having been located in the large open space of the warehouse. Mr Kinraid said that after sound bounces off hard surfaces like walls, ceilings and concrete floors it is eventually picked up at the microphone some little time after the sound from the direct source is picked up by the microphone. This delay or echo makes the sound very convolved and the recorded voice sounds more complex. What the filter does is to make an estimation of what might happen in the future, so by a series of coefficients it locates a repeated noise as something that needs to be reduced. In essence, it filters out the the echo, or time delay, which results from large reverbertant space. As I understand it, this has the effect of “cleaning” the sound and simulating what would be heard if the source was directed only at the microphone, without the delayed repetition of the reflected sounds. Again, Mr Kinraid said that the application of the filter should have no deleterious effect on the spoken voice.
	
	
	The third filter applied was a parametric equalization filter. It is intended to lower the amplification of annoying tones at particular frequencies, so as to reduce them to background noise. The filter does not have an effect on the speech sounds per se, nor does it remove them. It is intended to facililtate the listenability of recorded speech.
	
	
	The final filter Mr Kinraid applied was a compression filter. This is a tool to improve the level of quiet background sounds when there are no louder sounds present. So, where there are large workshop noises in the foreground, for example, the filter sets those loud noises to a lower level with the net effect being that the volume of quieter noises is amplified so they are easier to hear, rather than being overpowered by the very loud sounds. The consequence of the combined application of this filter and the adaptive filter is that it could create an impression that the source of a particular sound is closer to the microphone than it is in fact.
	
	
	Throughout the process of applying each of the filters, Mr Kinraid adopted a checking procedure which involved listening to the recording before and after each adjustment. It was as he described it a live comparison, which he was able to do with the click of a button. If there was the desired improvement in the quality of the audio the adjustment would be maintained. If not, it would be discarded and other adjustments would be attempted.
	
	
	Throughout the voir-dire the mp4 recordings that were sent to Mr Kinraid were described as the “unenhanced” audio and the product which resulted from the application of his expertise, that is the .wav files, was described as the “enhanced” audio.
	
	
	Whilst the enhanced audio is considerably easier to listen to, its quality and its capacity for meaningful analysis is still affected by some of the factors outlined in paragraph 7 above.
	
	
	It was put to Mr Kinraid in cross-examination that the digital manipulation of the audio which he performed could result in alterations to the speech captured on the recording. He accepted that this was possible, but regarded it as a very remote possibility and unlikely to occur.
	
	
	In the period 25 January 2012 to 20 February 2012, Adam Jones, another AFP officer who had by that stage been engaged on Operation Copia for approximately 6 months, spent some time preparing a transcript of the unenhanced recording. He originally estimated that he had spent 300 hours on that task. Later in his cross-examination he conceded it could not have been any more than about 135 hours at most and that he was unable to provide any certainty as to how much time was actually devoted to the task. His statement, and the transcript which his efforts produced which is annexed to it, are exhibit VD F. At the time he prepared the transcript Mr Jones had been an AFP officer for 4 or 5 years. He had no qualifications in speech science, acoustics or linguistics and had no training or qualifications in transcription. He had, at most, limited experience in transcription. He claimed to have transcribed telephone intercept recordings on 3 prior occasions. However, he had no recollection of when he had done this, or even the names of the associated operations.
	
	
	Mr Jones said he watched and listened to the unenhanced recording twice before commencing his preparation of the transcript. Over that period of nearly a month in January and February 2012, Mr Jones listened to the unenhanced recording the whole way through about 4 or 5 times. Twice before commencing the transcript, twice after completing the transcript to check it and, presumably, possibly one other time. As he was transcribing it he also listened multiple times to various discrete, but unidentified, passages which he found difficult to discern. From time to time he collaborated with Tara Beckett and possibly others as to their opinion of these difficult passages. If their opinion differed from his he said his opinion prevailed and is reflected in the transcript. Ms Beckett’s recollection was that she was consulted in this way roughly ten times by Mr Jones whilst he was preparing the transcript of the unenhanced recording. He seemed less certain as to how many times it occurred.
	
	
	Ms Beckett has prepared two statements for the purposes of the proceedings. The first, dated 6 June 2012 (Ex VD G), had annexed to it a transcipt of the enhanced recording signed by her on each page. In her statement she attested to the accuracy of that transcript. I will in a moment explain the process by which that transcript was prepared. Her second statement was made on Saturday 15 March 2014, two days before the trial commenced, and some considerable time after the date fixed by the Court for service of the prosecution evidence. That statement (Ex VD H) had annexed to it two documents. The first was an amended version of the June 2012 transcript which had been prepared on about 14 and 15 March 2014. The second was a document in a tabular format which had in one column a version of Mr Jones’ transcript of the unenhanced recording and in a column to the right of that a version of Ms Beckett’s transcript of the enhanced recording. This amalgamated document had also been produced on about 15 March 2014 and was itself an amendment to an earlier document which took essentially the same tabular format and which I was told had been produced for some purpose connected with the commital proceedings (Ex VD N). It emerged in the course of her cross-examination that the version of the transcript of the enhanced recording which appears in the amalgamated document annexed to her March statement is different both to her June 2012 transcript and to the other transcript annexed to the March 2014 statement.
	
	
	Ms Beckett’s first transcript was produced in the following way. At some unidentified time after she had received the enhanced recording from Mr Kinraid in November 2011 she listened to sections of the enhanced recording. Prior to that, she had also listened to portions only (again unidentified) of the unenhanced recording for some purpose connected with bail applications, as well as those portions Mr Jones had asked her to opine upon. In addition, in her capacity as officer in charge of the investigation she had read the transcript produced by Mr Jones.
	
	
	At some time which she could not specify, beyond estimating around April/May 2012, Ms Beckett sent the enhanced recording to Auscript. Auscript is an independent transcription service which has a contract with the AFP and from time to time transcribes for them listening device and other recordings, such as recorded interviews. Auscript completed a transcript of the enhanced recording which they provided to Ms Beckett. It is Ex VD 5.
	
	
	After receiving the Auscript transcript, Ms Beckett listened to the enhanced recording and began preparing her own version of a transcript by making amendments to the Auscript transcript with the use of word processing software. This task commenced sometime on 5 June 2012 and was completed sometime on the following day. The transcript so produced is the one annexed to Ex VD G. In the course of making the transcript she estimates she listened to the recording twice through in its entirety, but also listened two to five times to some passages that were difficult to discern. Ms Beckett was unable to estimate how many hours she was engaged in this task and she has no records recording the time spent.
	
	
	Ms Beckett described her process of deduction in attributing identity in the transcript to various speakers in the following way (at p 56.38 of the transcript on 26 March 2014):
	


Male 1, Benjamin Faulkner, he identified himself on the tape and he spelt his name out.  Male number 2 was by deduction as he had called Male 3 ""Peter"" and then the only female that was in the warehouse was Ms Nguon and we could identify that through the video on the day of their arrest.


	
	At some time after completing her first transcript in June 2012, and presumably prior to the commital in May 2013, Ms Beckett produced the first amalgamated document (Ex VD N) which contained in tabular form the transcript prepared by Mr Jones in the left hand column and her transcript of the enhanced recording in the right hand column. The first column in that document contains what has been described as a time-stamp for the unenhanced recording. That is, against portions of the transcript there is recorded the time of the day at which the various asserted passages of speech occurred. There was no similar time-stamp for the transcript of the enhanced recording which appeared in the right hand column of that document.
	
	
	Purportedly for the purpose of time-stamping the transcript of the enhanced recording in this amalgamated document, on 14 March 2014, the Friday before the commencement of this trial on Monday 17 March, Ms Jones commenced listening again to the enhanced recording and whilst doing so made various – though as it turns out not identical – amendments to both the transcript of the enhanced recording in the amalgamated document and the transcript which she had produced by amendment of the Auscript transcript in June 2012. Why she embarked upon the time-stamping of the amalgamated document was never explained; and seems a curious thing to have done, having regard to the fact that it has not been suggested that the Crown proposes to rely upon that document in any respect in these proceedings. In any event, that was Ms Beckett’s explanation for returning to the recordings and the transcripts.
	
	
	The amendments made on this occasion included the addition of some of the most hotly contested portions of the transcript. The prime example, for present purposes, is the change from “I don’t know … (indistinct)… tapping” (p 6 of the transcript annexed to Ex VD G) to “Cocaine… (indistinct) tapping… Cocaine” (p 6 of the transcript annexed to Ex VD H). In addition to that change there are numerous other changes that are the subject of serious and, in my view, well founded dispute. Those changes include significant, and at least in my view having listened to the recording, erroneous, changes to the attribution of identity of various speakers.
	
	
	Ms Beckett now confidently acclaims that the version of the transcript which she produced on 15 March is accurate. She attributes her confidence in the accuracy of the transcript generally, and the most recent changes she has made to it in particular, to two things primarily. The first is that when she listened to the transcript in March this year, she did it in a quieter part of the AFP’s premises than the general operations area where she had apparently worked on the June 2012 transcript. The second is that in the preceding two years she has had a number of face to face meetings with Faulkner and DB and claims to have, by reason of those meetings, come to know better the characteristics of each of their voices.
	
	
	Incriminating opinion evidence identifying alleged offenders and the content of their conversations on sound recordings has been admitted in a number of cases, or at least permitted to go to the jury as an “aide memoire”. The opinions are sometimes those of investigating officers and have been profferred on the basis of what has become known as “ad hoc expertise”. Put broadly, the contention supporting receipt of this material on one basis or another, that is, either in evidence or as an aid, has been that the so called ad-hoc expert has aquired “expertise” as to the content of the recording by repeated listening.
	
	
	The Crown proposes to tender at trial both the unenhanced recordings (audio and video) and the enhanced recording (audio only). It also originally proposed to tender transcripts of those recordings.
	
	
	By a Notice of Motion dated 5 March 2014, Ms Nguon objected to the tender of particular identified pages of the transcripts of the unenhanced and enhanced recordings. In that application Ms Nguon relied in particular on ss 79, 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act. In the course of the voir-dire the Crown changed its position. It now proposes that the transcripts go to the jury only as aides memoire. It proposes that the transcript of the unenhanced recording prepared by Mr Jones be provided to the jury as an aide memoire to assist them in listening to that recording. It further proposes that the transcript of the enhanced recording prepared by Ms Beckett on about 15 March 2014 (not the one in the amalgamated document, but rather the one which amends the June 2012 transcript) be provided to the jury as an aide memoire to assist them in listening to that recording.
	
	
	Ms Nguon and Mr Ream both oppose the use of those transcripts as aids. Ms Nguon also applies to have the enhanced recording excluded in the exercise of the discretion pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	The Crown submits, and I don’t understand it to be disputed, that the procedure of providing a jury with a transcript of a recording to use as an aide memoire when listening to the recording has the imprimatur of the High Court and other superior courts binding on me: see, in particular, Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180, at 188; R v Cassar [1999] NSWSC 436; R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405; Li v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 281.
	
	
	It is also common ground, as I understand it, that whether or not that procedure is adopted in any particular case is in the discretion of the trial judge and each case must be assessed in the light of its own particular facts and circumstances.
	
	
	In summary, the Crown’s submissions in favour of the transcripts being provided to the jury as an aid in this case are to the following effect.
	
	
	First, the tapes are long, each being approximately 2¼ hours in length.
	
	
	Second, the tapes are of poor quality and need to be listened to a number of times in order adequately to make out much of the speech that is recorded.
	
	
	Third, the two police officers who have produced the transcripts have had the opportunity to listen to the tapes numerous times – in the case of Mr Jones, purportedly four or five times in total, with repeated listening to some unidentified passages; and, in the case of Ms Beckett, four times in total over a period of 2 years, also with additional repeated listening to some more difficult, but also unidentified passages. In Ms Beckett’s case, in respect of the March 2014 transcript, it is also submitted that she has the additonal benefit of having interviewed Faulkner and DB a number of times in the preceding couple of years. By that means, it is submitted, she has acquired some knowledge and understanding about the particular characteristics of each of their voices which assists her in attributing identity to different speakers on the recording.
	
	
	Fourth, the involvement of those officers in the investigation, and the knowledge they have in that connection acquired, gives them a peculiar advantage in creating a transcript and attributing meaning and identity to passages of speech. It is also submitted, correctly, that the authorities which proceed from Butera make it clear that the fact that a transcriber is involved in the investigation is not necessarily an impediment either to the admissibility of a transcript, where that is what is in issue, or to its alternative use as an aide memoire.
	
	
	Fifth, the potential dangers to which the accused point in resisting the use of the transcripts as an aid can all be cured by appropriate directions. The principal dangers that are identified, so far as questions of fairness to the accused are concerned, relate to the possibility that in circumstances where the recording is of poor quality, and hence very difficult to listen to, and the transcripts are produced by experienced police officers, the jury will eschew their responsibility to listen carefully to the evidence and to draw their own conclusions about it and will accord priority to the aid over the evidence, on the not unreasonable assumption that it has the imprimatur of those experienced police officers. The sort of direction that is contemplated by the Crown is to the effect that the transcript is not evidence, but merely a guide and that they must make their own minds up about the content and context of any speech and the identity of the speakers. It is submitted that I must assume that a jury will understand the directions and act upon them.
	
	
	Sixth, the fact that there are differences between the transcript produced by Mr Jones and the one most recently produced by Ms Beckett would operate to reinforce, in the minds of the jury, a direction as to the basis for provision of the transcript and the appropriate use to be made of it.
	
	
	Finally, it is submitted that use of the transcripts would not invite an inordinate lengthening and complication of the trial. Indeed, the Crown submission appears to be that the use of the transcripts as an aid will achieve some efficiency and an inevitable shortening of the trial.
	
	
	The Crown relies, in support of the use of the transcripts as an aid, on the proposition that Mr Jones and Ms Beckett have become qualified as “ad hoc” experts. It is submitted that the cases recognise that where a recording is of poor quality a jury may be assisted by a transcript made by someone who has listened repeatedly to the recordings.
	
	
	The notion of ad hoc expertise, at least in this connection, appears to have its genesis in R v Menzies [1982] 1 NZLR 41. In that case, the debate concerned whether or not a jury should have access to a transcript of voice recordings covertly made. The NZ Court of Appeal concluded that where the quality of the recordings was so poor the provision of “expert” assistance to the jury was justified. It was held that a detective had acquired a special expertise by reason of repeated listening to the recordings. Cooke J stated, at 49:
	


… deficiencies in the recording may make it necessary to play tapes more than once to enable a better understanding, yet the sheer length of the tapes may mean that inordinate time would be taken by replaying them to the jury. In such cases, while there should normally be at least one playing to the jury, the evidence of an expert should be admissible as an aid to the jury. He may be a temporary expert in the sense that by repeated listening to the tapes he has qualified himself ad hoc.


	
	For a period of time, the notion of ad hoc expertise remained confined to the production of transcripts from sound recordings as an intrerpretive aid for the jury: see Edmond & San Roque, Quasi-justice: Ad hoc expertise and identification evidence, (2009) 33 Crim LJ 8 at 9.
	
	
	The practice of allowing juries access to transcripts of recordings as an aid received the apparent imprimatur of the High Court in Butera. This is the case upon which the Crown primarily relies in support of the use of the transcripts as an aid in this case. It has been suggested that Butera does not provide a general warrant for those who have listened repeatedly to recordings to proffer their opinions about the identity of speakers on the recording as admissible evidence: see eg Edmond & San Roque, at p 9. Nor does it provide a general warrant for the use of transcripts as an aid. Ultimately, the case concerned finding an appropriate balance between notions of convenience on the one hand and the dictates of justice on the other. Certainly one point of distinction between Butera and the present case is that it, like many of the cases which have followed it, involved the significant complication of being concerned with recordings that were substantially in a foreign language. In those circumstances the primary evidence, the recordings, is of essentially no utility to a jury and there is an inevitable need for the application of genuine expertise by translators.
	
	
	In Eastman v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 9; 158 ALR 107, the Full Court of the Federal Court considered the use that might legitimately be made of transcripts of indistinct recordings that had been digitally enhanced. The court concluded that police officers who had spent thousands of hours listening to the recordings were “qualified ad hoc in interpreting the utterances of the appellant that were audible” and so permitted the use of the transcripts as an aid for the jury: at p 112. At pp 112 - 113 the Court (Von Doussa, O’Loughlin and Cooper JJ), accepted the approach endorsed in Menzies and Butera and stated:
	


The evidence of the witnesses on this topic disclosed that the tape recordings upon which the Crown sought to rely are in many places indistinct, and extremely difficult to decipher… The tapes were transferred to a digital form of electronic recording, and then enhanced. Mr McQuillen and Ms Lawson listened to the tapes for thousands of hours and became qualified ad hoc in interpreting the utterances of the appellant that were audible. It was common ground between all the witnesses on this topic that the transfer of the recordings to digital form and the enhancement process did not produce artefacts. The jury, when it heard the recordings, listened to enhanced tapes rather than the original master tapes. This was done without objection, and the master tapes were tendered in evidence so that they could have been played had that been requested.

The poor quality of recording would have made it very difficult for the jury to have comprehended the recorded utterances if it had listened  to the tapes unaided by the transcript prepared by Mr McQuillen. It seems to us that it would have been a largely pointless exercise to have required this, and one that would have been immediately followed by what in fact occurred, namely that the jury was informed of Mr McQuillen's interpretation of the sounds, and then the tapes were played whilst the jury had Mr McQuillen's transcript before it as an aid. The procedure followed in this case was the procedure approved in R v Miladinovic (1992) 107 FLR 241 at 248 and R v Watts [1992] 1 Qd R 214 at 222.


	
	There is a fundamental point of distinction between the present case and the facts in Eastman. In that case the authors of the transcript had spent thousands of hours listening to the tapes. That is far from analagous to the present case which is more analagous to the circumstances in Smith v the Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650.
	
	
	In Smith the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ) made the following observations, pertinent by analogy with the present circumstances, at [11] (my emphasis):
	


Because the witness's assertion of identity was founded on material no different from the material available to the jury from its own observation, the witness's assertion that he recognised the appellant is not evidence that could rationally affect the assessment by the jury of the question we have identified. The fact that someone else has reached a conclusion about the identity of the accused and the person in the picture does not provide any logical basis for affecting the jury's assessment of the probability of the existence of that fact when the conclusion is based only on material that is not different in any substantial way from what is available to the jury. The process of reasoning from one fact (the depiction of a man in the security photographs) taken with another fact (the observed appearance of the accused) to the conclusion (that one is the depiction of the other) is neither assisted, nor hindered, by knowing that some other person has, or has not, arrived at that conclusion. Indeed, if the assessment of probability is affected by that knowledge, it is not by any process of reasoning, but by the decision-maker permitting substitution of the view of another, for the decision-maker's own conclusion.


	
	Certainly in Smith the High Court was talking peculiarly about visual identification and it was in the context of an issue of admissibilty rather than use of opinions as an aid. However it seems to me that what the Court there says applies a fortiori when one is considering the use of an opinion solely as an aid, unconcerned about its admissibility strictly per se. Furthermore, it seems to me that their Honours’ observations are equally applicable to opinions about the content and context of speech (where the relevant language is English) as they are to questions of identification. Here the opinions of the AFP officers reflected in the transcript go to all three matters: content, context and identity.
	
	
	In R v Cassar [1999] NSWSC 436, Sperling J catalogued a number of propositions said to be drawn from the combined operation of the Evidence Act and the decisions in Menzies, Butera and Eastman. Those propositions, outlined by by his Honour at [7] were as follows (the references to Eastman are to the ALR report):
	


(a) A document that purports to be a transcript of words recorded on a tape is admissible to prove the conversation: s48(1)(c);

(b) No oral or other evidence is necessary to validate such a transcript, it being sufficient that it purports to be a transcript of the words: s48(1)(c);

(c) Where a tape is indistinct, a transcript may be used to assist the jury in the perception and understanding of what is recorded on the tape: Butera at 187;

(d) Where a tape is indistinct, a transcript made by an ""ad hoc expert"", being a person qualified only by having listened to the tape many times, may be used for this purpose. That is particularly so where the tape needs to be played over repeatedly before the words uttered could be made out unaided: Menzies at 49 cited in Butera at 188;

(e) If there is doubt or disagreement whether the transcript accurately deciphers the sounds captured on the tape, the transcript should be used only as an aide-memoire. I take that to mean that the jury is to give priority to what they hear (or do not hear) on the tape, if that is not consistent with what appears in the transcript: Butera at 188;

(f) The jury may have the transcript before them when this tape is played over in court: Eastman at 200;

(g) The jury should be informed, when the transcript is tendered, as to the use which they may make of it: Eastman at 220;

(h) A transcript may be rejected or its use limited pursuant to ss 135-137.


	
	In their very helpful paper earlier referred to, Edmond & San Roque trace the development of the concept of ad hoc expertise in the subsequent case law and, in particular, the transition from its use to assist juries in deciphering the content of audio surveillance recordings to the more contentious and problematic area of identification of voices.
	
	
	That transition seems to be best reflected in NSW in the decisions of the CCA in R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 and Li v The Queen (2003) 139 A Crim R 281.
	
	
	The combined effect of the various cases to which I have referred, which in the main are self-evidently binding on me, reflects acceptance, in an appropriate case and subject to an over-riding discretion in a trial judge, of a practice of permitting the use, either by admission in evidence or provision as an aid, of a transcript of a recording to facilitate a jury’s convenience in listening to recordings of dubious quality. Furthermore, the cases reflect a preparedness to allow the use of transcripts prepared by police investigating the relevant offences, as distinct from transcripts prepared independent of an investigating authority.
	
	
	There is no doubt that in appropriate circumstances a transcript may be very beneficial in facilitating the task of a tribunal of fact. This will particularly be the case where the primary evidence consists of recordings of conversations in a foreign language. In that case there is an obvious necessity for the introduction of genuine expertise. That is, a ""bridge between data in the form of primary evidence and a conclusion which cannot be reached without the application of expertise"": Dasreef v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588, per Heydon J, at [90]. The primary evidence, foreign language conversations, will be meaningless to most tribunals of fact without the admission of expert opinion evidence translating the conversations. In those cases the admission of the expert evidence can be subject to the the full rigour of the limitations on admissibility of evidence of that character which the law imposes, in particular under s 79 of the Evidence Act. The opinions will be relevant and admissible because they can sensibly be said, in those cases, to rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. The situation will generally, if not invariably, be quite different where the recorded conversations are in English. Obviously where there is no controversy about the opinions which a transcript represents then there will be no harm, and considerable convenience, in a jury having it either in evidence or as an aid to their own assessment of the underlying evidence. However, in most English language cases, particularly where there is a genuine contest about the opinions which a transcript represents, the situation is fundamentally no different to the one which the High Court addressed in Smith.
	
	
	It seems to me that the superior courts will in due course have to give more detailed consideration than has so far been given to the foundation, as a matter of principle, for the notion of ad hoc expertise. There is even more crucial need for principled scrutiny of the notion where the contested conversations are exclusively in English and the relevant expertise has been gained in the course of an investigation. It may be that a consideration of the foundation of ad hoc expertise as a matter of legal principle will also, on an appropriate occasion, be usefully informed by expert evidence, for example from the field of cognitive psychology and cognate disciplines, about contextual and confirmation bias and questions of priming.
	
	
	It is possible that the existence of the over-riding discretion in the trial judge will ultimately be found to provide adequate protection. However, in circumstances where it involves such a serious undermining both of the strictures on admission of opinion evidence and the rigour which ought to be observed with evidence of identification, the notion of ad hoc expertise is arguably indefensible as a matter of legal principle, particularly where English language conversations are concerned. It seems to me to have even more serious problems where the ad hoc expert has acquired the so-called expertise in the context of a police investigation.
	
	
	The common law early recognised the problems, which one might characterise as contextual or confirmation bias, which arise from expression of opinion based upon the acquisition of knowledge in the course of a criminal investigation.
	
	
	In 1850, the opinion of a police officer who had identified an accused as the author of a threatening letter was excluded. The investigating officer knew the accused from prior dealings but had not previously encountered his handwriting. Discussing the exclusion of this identification evidence, Maule J explained (R v Crouch (1850) 4 Cox CC 163 at 164):
	


Knowledge so obtained, that is to say, for such a specific purpose, and under such a bias, is not such as to make a man admissible as a quasi-expert witness. He does not come to speak to a fact, but as a witness of skill, to give his judgment upon a particular question. The only means he has had of acquiring a capability to form such judgment are not such as to make him a competent witness in that particular.


	
	Explaining his Lordship’s remarks, and endorsing the exclusionary approach which it reflects, the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Richard (1918) 13 Cr App R 140 said:
	


That case does not decide what degree of preparedness is necessary to constitute an expert, but it does decide that a person is not entitled to give such evidence if his only knowledge of the subject is that acquired in the course of the case.


	
	The caution and prudence which those remarks represent seems to have been overtaken, at least in this country, by the development of the case law on ad hoc expertise.
	
	
	It was submitted by Ms Yehia SC, for Ms Nguon, that the notion of ad hoc expertise purportedly obtained by investigating police officers is the modern day equivalent of the police verbal. I think that submission has considerable force. In Driscoll v R (1977) 137 CLR 517, Gibbs J, with whom Mason and Jacobs JJ agreed, made the following observations concerning the use of unsigned records of interview, at p 542:
	


The danger is that a jury may erroneously regard the written record as in some way strengthening or corroborating the oral testimony. Moreover the record, if admitted, will be taken into the jury room when the jury retire to consider their verdict, and by its very availability may have an influence upon their deliberations which is out of all proportion to its real weight. For these reasons, it would appear to me that in all cases in which an unsigned record of interview is tendered the judge should give the most careful consideration to the question whether it is desirable in the interests of justice that it should be excluded.


	
	It seems to me that there are obvious analagous problems with the use of opinions of police officers about the content and context of recorded conversations and the identity of the participants in those conversations. Those problems are necessarily greater where the transcripts are disputed in significant and material respects. The problems are not cured by the simple expedient of using the transcripts as an aid, rather than tendering them.
	
	
	Whether it exists as a reflection of considered principle or as a result of judicial pragmatism in particular cases, for present purposes I am bound to give appropriate recognition to the existence of the concept of ad hoc expertise. Ultimately, as I earlier indicated, it exists in aid of juries’ convenience. As Gaudron J observed in Butera, at p 211:
	


“… questions of convenience are not at large: ""Convenience and justice are often not on speaking terms""…. The discretion of a trial judge to make available to the jury a transcript of evidence given by a witness is a discretion which is circumscribed by conventional considerations of fairness. Thus, without being exhaustive, there is no discretion to make available a transcript if it would tend to unduly emphasize the evidence, or to accord to it a probative value which it does not possess. …


	
	Although her Honour was in dissent in respect of the result in that case, the force and cogency of her remarks are not diminshed by that fact. It is that potential contest between convenience and the interests of justice and the fair conduct of a trial which, in my view, underpins the discretion whether or not to allow the use of transcripts as an aid. As I have indicated, the existence of that discretion is not in issue.
	
	
	Ultimately, in the exercise of the discretion, I have concluded that the transcripts should not go to the jury as an aide memoire. There are at least five principal reasons why I think that is the preferable course. Some of them are, in my view, sufficient in and of themselves to justify that conclusion. In combination the conclusion is compelling in my view.
	
	
	First, I am not satisfied that the transcripts are a beneficial aid to critical listening to either of the audio recordings. In fact I think it more probable than not, indeed likely, that by reason of the form and content of the transcripts the jury would be distracted from their task of attending to the evidence by having the transcripts available as a so called aid. I have listened to each of the recordings on the voir dire, and in the course of listening to them attempted to follow them with the assistance of the respective transcripts. Such is the form and content of each of the transcripts that I found the task of listening was significantly distracted by frequently attempting to work out where in the transcript one was at any particular time. There are intermittent and irregular indications in the transcripts of how far into the recording one has progressed. In addition there are extensive periods in the recordings where there is no meaningful dialogue and all that can be heard is the industrial sounds that I earlier referred to or electronic interference or static. Some of these periods, and there are many of them, last for as much as 10 or 15 minutes. Others are of shorter duration, but are frequently recurring. As a consequence of the occurrence and duration of these periods not being recorded in the transcript, I found myself frequently scanning backwards and forwards in the transcript to work out if my reading had got out of synch with the recording and trying to determine if I had missed a passage. The consequence was inevitable distraction from concentrating on the recording. I consider that there is a very real likelihood that a jury would be similarly distracted, rather than assisted, by provision of the transcripts.
	
	
	This particular difficulty with the transcripts seems to me to exacerbate the potential for the jury to give priority to the content of the transcripts, rather than the evidence itself, thus giving probative force to the opinions of the transcribers which they are not intended to have and should not have, given that the transcripts are not evidence. As a matter of human experience, I think there is a very real danger that where the quality of the recordings is as poor as it is, even in the enhanced version, and calls for careful, critical, listening to discern the content and if possible the context of any dialogue, a jury would be inevitably inclined toward reliance upon the transcript rather than their own assessment of the recording. This is precisely the vice to which Gibbs J adverted in the passage cited above from Driscoll. I think this danger is even greater where the transcripts are the product of the efforts of experienced police officers. The jury is likely to take some comfort from the trancripts having that sort of apparently authoritative imprimatur. In that event, the evidence will have been supplanted with opinions which are in substantial respects disputed, and hence argumentative, and which, in the case of an aide memoire, are not in evidence.
	
	
	These particular dangers are real and, in my view, not capable of adequate, amelioration by directions. As Gleeson CJ and Gummow J observed in Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13]: “The system of criminal justice as administered by appellate courts requires the assumption that as a general rule, juries understand and follow the directions they are given by trial judges. It does not involve the assumption that their decision making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice”. It is the latter part of that proposition which informs the existence of exclusionary discretions and the necessity on occasions to discharge juries. The law recognises that not every potentially prejudicial risk can be adequately overcome, so as to ensure a fair trial, by the giving of directions. In my view, the dangers to which I have adverted in respect of these transcripts are not amenable to adequate amelioration by any direction which I might be able to give. The dangers of course are amplified in the present case by the fact that it is proposed that two different transcripts be put before the jury, made by two different police officers.
	
	
	The second reason I have concluded that the transcripts should not be permitted as an aid, at least not in circumstances where crucial parts of their content is so hotly contested and, in my view, contested on grounds that are reasonable and sustainable, is that I think in all the circumstances of this case the jury is in as good a position as Mr Jones and Ms Beckett to form their own conclusions about what the recordings reveal. In many respects the circumstances are analagous to those which were the subject of the High Court’s consideration (in the context of visual identification opinions) in Smith.
	
	
	In the present case the recordings are in English. There is no complication by intrusion of any foreign languages, which necessarily require the application of some expertise to translate.
	
	
	The recordings are reasonably lenghty, at approximately 2¼ hours duration each. However, they are not inordinately or impractically lengthy. Furthermore, the crucial parts of the transcript, so far as there is a need to identify dialogue which the Crown will no doubt contend has an inculpatory character, are very short and can be readily identified by reference to a point of time in the recording. The totality of these passages would not exceed more than a few minutes in total. The practical consequence of these factors is that, with relative ease, the jury can put themselves, or in address be put, in the same position as the AFP officers who prepared the transcripts. I have already referred above to the amount of time those officers spent listening to the respective recordings. As I have already noted, this is not a case like Eastman, where the authors of the transcripts had spent thousands of hours listening to the recordings. Personally, I don’t understand how the length of time listening to recordings can fairly be said to generate or reinforce expertise, rather than bias, but it remains a point of significant distinction between that case and the present.
	
	
	The third reason in support of my conclusion, which is closely related to the second, is that in my assessment the authors of the transcripts are not relevantly ad hoc experts.
	
	
	In respect of Mr Jones, he initially opined that he had spent some 300 hours in total preparing the transcript. In further cross-examination on that estimate, he conceded that he could not in fact have spent any more than 135 hours at most in listening to the tapes. In my assessment it is more likely than not that he spent considerably less time than that on the task and that his estimate is unreliable. He eventually claimed that he spent about four to five hours per day in the relevant period in January and February 2012 listening to the tapes and preparing the transcript. His police diary, however, does not record any of that work. As I understood his and Ms Beckett’s evidence, the purpose of officers maintaining their police diary is to keep a record of the time spent on significant tasks. In the relevant period Mr Jones’ diary only records work performed on an unrelated investigation which was apparently in its early stages at the time. His failure to record in his diary any time relating to work done on the transcript is irreconcilable with his estimate of the time spent on the task. By the failure to record any time in the diary, and in the absence of any other evidence supportive of his estimate, I conclude that it is more likely than not that the time devoted to the task of transcribing the unenhanced audio in the relevant period was insignificant. Had it been significant, his and Ms Beckett’s evidence gives the clear impression it would have had some reflection in the diary. His explanation for the failure to record any of the time he asserts he spent on the task was unconvincing and I do not accept it. Indeed, he was far from certain in his estimate in any event. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that a great deal of time was devoted to the task of listening to the recording and producing the transcript. Even if Mr Jones had devoted the whole of his estimated 135 hours to task, that does not in my mind justify either the conclusion that he has acquired ad hoc expertise sufficient to accord his opinions the status of providing any benefit to the jury, or the conclusion that he is in any better position than the jury will be by the end of the evidence in the trial to form their own conclusions about the content and context of conversations on the recording and the identity of speakers.
	
	
	I reach the same conclusions in respect of Ms Beckett. She has listened to the tape a maximum of four times in total and has additionally replayed, an unknown number of times, certain unidentified portions of the tape to try and discern what is recorded. She first listened to the tape twice in June 2012, the product of which was the substantially amended Auscript transcript which she annexed to her statement of 6 June 2012. She returned to the task on the eve of the commencement of the trial, in March 2014, purportedly purely to time-stamp one version of the transcript. Curiously, the version of the transcript which she time-stamped is not the one which the Crown seeks to rely upon for present purposes. In addition to time stamping that version of the transcript she also made some changes to the transcript from June 2012 which had been based upon the Auscript transcript. There is not conformity between that transcript, which is annexed to her statement of 15 March 2014, and which is the one the Crown wishes to use as an aid for the jury, and the newly time-stamped transcript.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Ms Beckett defended her asserted confidence in the accuracy of her 15 March transcript with a vehemence that caused me more concern than it gave me any comfort. The version of the transcript on which the Crown seeks to rely had added to it, long after the time by which the Crown was obliged to provide materials to the accused, substantial potentially inculpatory material. I am far from satisfied that the transcript which is proferred is accurate or reliable in many significant respects. It contains words, some the subject of fierce debate, which I certainly was unable to discern on listening to the recording. It does not contain words that I clearly heard. It contains admitted errors, some of them substantial, particularly as to attribution. It is at odds with the transcript of Mr Jones in significant respects and it differs in numerous substantial respects from the version produced in June 2012.
	
	
	The Crown sought to supplement the submission as to Ms Beckett’s ad hoc expertise, and the likely accuracy of the latest version of the transcript, with the proposition that Ms Beckett has spent numerous hours in face to face contact and discussion with Mr Faulkner and Mr DB in the two years between June 2012 and the present. This, so it is submitted, gives her a greater capacity to recognise the voices of DB and Faulkner on the tape and so by a process of deduction to identify Ms Nguon and Mr Ream when they are speaking.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that any of the circumstances relied upon justify a conclusion that Ms Beckett has ad hoc expertise such that her opinions as to content, context and identity on the tape would provide any real benefit to a jury over and above what the members of the jury would be able to determine for themselves by faithfully fulfilling their oaths and affirmations. The potential which I have outlined above for the transcripts to mislead rather than benefit a jury is exacerbated both by the numerous errors which the transcript in my assessment appears to contain, only some of which are admitted, and by the inconsistencies between the two transcripts sought to be relied upon.
	
	
	In R v Hall [2001] NSWSC 827 Greg James J had occasion to draw a parallel between the High Court’s decision in Smith concerning visual identification evidence, to which I have earlier referred, and opinion evidence of police concerning aural identification from lawfully obtained covert recordings. After referring to the High Court’s decision in Smith, his Honour made the following observations, at [39], which are apposite in the present case:
	


I have a similar problem in the present matter to that with which the High Court dealt. I consider I cannot simply substitute the views of the police officers as expressed in the transcript for my own appreciation of what might have been said or who spoke. Nor can I assume that because the officers assert the transcript reflects what they heard, the transcript should be used to give that content to the sounds. They are not experts nor can I hear nor conclude that a jury could hear on the CDS what is on the transcript. In this case, to use the transcript as an aide while listening would be likely to have the effect of allowing the police officers’ views to so affect what is discerned as to substitute their views of the content for what would be independently appreciated as the content. It may be that the police officers have, after many repetitions, reached the opinion that the content is as set out in the transcript. I simply have no information as to whether a jury might feasibly attempt to test or reproduce what they did to reach that result. I consider the officers’ opinions are inadmissible and I would reject the use of the transcript because of the danger of its accuracy being untestable.


	
	As I indicated earlier, the dangers to which his Honour adverts seem to me only to be amplified rather than diminished by reason of the fact that the contested opinions are sought to be introduced as an aid and not as evidence.
	
	
	The fourth reason which founds my conclusion that the transcripts should not go to the jury is that reliance upon the transcripts, even as a mere aid, will have the likely result of inordinately lengthening the trial. Mr Hughes, for Mr Ream, submitted that if the transcripts were used as an aid it would be incumbent upon him and Ms Yehia SC, for Ms Ngoun, to introduce into evidence the various other transcripts that have been produced over the last two years. He submitted that exercise would be necessary to counter any possible adverse consequence for the accused arising from the essentially argumentative opinions of the AFP trancribers going before the jury in the form of aides memoire.
	
	
	To my mind, if the use of the transcripts as an aid were permitted, such an enquiry into the reliability, credibility and accuracy of the AFP officers’ opinions would be entirely justified so as to avoid any adverse consequences for the accused arising from the various dangers I have already identified. If the time that has been expended on the voir dire is any indication, that exercise, were it embarked upon, would be a necessarily time consuming one. It would have the consequence of substantially lengthening the trial with an issue that is for all intents and purposes collateral to a consideration of the real issues.
	
	
	The Crown submits that such an exercise could not and would not be permitted because the transcripts would not be evidence, they are merely used as aids. Strictly speaking, that may be right, but this is very much a “cake and eat it too” submission in my view. On the one hand the Crown wants contested opinions of experienced police officers placed before the jury, with all the inherent danger that those opinions will be given probative force to which they are not entitled, but would deny the accused the opportunity to go behind those opinions in the way envisaged by Mr Hughes’ submission. The extent to which this collateral issue would lengthen the trial would likely be sufficient in and of itself in my view to exclude the transcripts had they been tendered. This consideration has even greater force where the transcripts are only sought to be used as an aid.
	
	
	This leads to the fifth reason supporting my conclusions; considerations of fairness. If the transcripts go to the jury as an aid they will carry all the dangers of unfair prejudice to the accused that I have earlier identified. That is, in particular, the danger that the contested opinions of the transcribers, which are not evidence, will subvert the evidence and distract the jury from its task of considering the actual evidence, the recordings themselves. In the circumstances of the present case, those dangers cannot be adequately diminished by a direction to the jury, for the reasons I have outlined. Accordingly, there is patent unfair prejudice to the accused if the opinions are used as an aid. That unfairness is only exacerbated or further highlighted if the Crown’s submission referred to in the previous paragraph is correct and the accused are not able to go behind and test those opinions.
	
	
	By contrast, there is no unfairness to the Crown if the use of the transcripts as an aid is denied. The Crown submitted that there would be unfairness to it if use of the transcripts as an aid was denied. Madam Crown made the following submission, at p 202 of the transcript:
	


The unfairness, your Honour, is that they sit and listen to a recording cold where you've had evidence from the officers that it's taken them a number of times to get used to the noise, the way people are speaking so they can start understanding it.  So the unfairness to the Crown is if we don't have the guide or the aid, I may have to say to the jury, ""Terribly sorry about this, but you are going to have to listen to this two hour 15 minute recording four times or five times so that your ears start getting used to it and you can start properly understanding what was said"".


	
	In my view that submission dramatically overstates the reality of the situation. Indeed, as submitted on behalf of Ms Nguon, the Crown submission assumes precisely that which is the danger; that is, by being given the transcript the jury will substitute the opinion of the police for the acquisition of their own opinion by however many listenings that requires. The Crown case is not diminished in any respect and there is no relevant unfairness to the Crown in denial of the use of the transcripts as an aid. It has the evidence of the recordings to rely upon. Subject only to my ruling on an objection to the tender of the enhanced recording, to which I will shortly come, the recordings can be played to the jury. The critical parts can be played and replayed, including in address and by the jury in the privacy of the jury room. As I have already indicated, the crucial passages occupy very little time and could be played and replayed to and by the jury many, many times without it being an inordinately lengthy exercise.
	
	
	As I understood it, the parties were agreed that the considerations outlined at s 192(2) of the Evidence Act provide a useful guide to the appropriate considerations and parameters in the exercise of my discretion in respect of the use of the transcripts. Save for that concerning the nature of the proceeding, I think I have dealt in what I have said above with all those that are relevent in the present circumstances. This is a trial of serious criminal charges, it goes without saying that the exercise of any discretion must be circumscribed by a scrupulous attendance to ensuring a fair trial. That has informed my approach to each of the other considerations.
	
	
	For all the foregoing reasons, I decline to permit the use of the transcripts as aides memoire.
	
	
	As I have mentioned, Ms Nguon applies to have the evidence in the form of the enhanced recording excluded in the exercise of the discretion under s 135 of the Evidence Act. That application is supported by Mr Ream.
	
	
	Put very shortly, the submissions in support of that application are as follows.
	
	
	First, it is submitted that the best that can be said in favour of the enhanced recording is that it marginally improves listenability. However, it doesn’t improve the clarity of words spoken, particularly by the female, and hence it does not improve the intelligibility of the recording and so adds nothing to the probative value of the unenhanced recording. The probative value of the enhanced recording, on that basis, so it is submitted, is at best slight.
	
	
	Second, it is submitted that the enhanced recording is apt to be confusing or misleading because of the consequence of the combined application of the adaptive filter and the compression filter, which I referred to at paragraph 17 above. This is said to be of particular significance to the case against Ms Nguon, because her precise location within the warehouse during the afternoon of 4 November 2011 and the level of her involvement in the activities of the males and her proximity to the grapple bucket are central issues in the case.
	
	
	Third, it is submitted that admission of the enhanced recording would result in undue waste of time, involving the need to listen to two recordings in circumstances where the intelligibility is only marginally, if at all, improved in the enhanced recording.
	
	
	It is true to say that the enhanced audio is more “listenable” by reason of the efforts of Mr Kinraid. I think it understates the position slightly to attribute no improvement in intelligibility. Though I do think it is reasonable to say that those improvements are probably only marginal, given that whilst more conversation is discernible, there are no great advances in determining the context of most of that conversation. To that extent it might be said that the enhanced recording adds little to the probative value of the unenhanced recording when one considers their combined effect. However, even accepting that there is only limited supplementation of Crown case over and above what it gains from the unenhanced recording, the probative value of the enhanced recording is high in my view. Considered on its own, and not by reference to the combined effect of it and the unenhanced recording, its probative value is very high. It goes to a critical aspect of the Crown case.
	
	
	I accept that the enhancements have the capacity to create the impression in a listener that a particular speaker is closer to the listening device than is in fact the case. This necessarily gives rise to concerns about the capacity for the jury to be confused or misled. These concerns, however, seem to me to be well capable of being addressed by the cross-examination of Mr Kinraid and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, directions from me. The question which is central to the case against Ms Nguon then becomes a matter for the jury’s determination in the conventional way. I do not think the capacity for misleading or confusion is such as to outweigh the probative value. This is an instance where, whilst I accept there is some danger of confusion or of the jury being misled, it can be adequately cured so as to avoid unfair prejudice, such that as between probative value and potential prejudice the balance does not favour exclusion. Accordingly, I would not exclude the enhanced recording on this basis.
	
	
	As to the potential for undue waste of time, again I do not think that the balance favours exclusion. Certainly the necessity to listen to the enhanced as well as the unenhanced recordings will add some time to the length of the trial. That additional time is not inordinate in my view. Particularly in circumstances where I have disallowed the use of the transcripts as aids, I think the jury’s task will be facilitated by access to both recordings. The enhanced recording is more listenable and, apart from the capacity to create a misleading impression as to the location of a speaker, does not effect any adverse change to the recorded conversations. Where the jury may well have to listen to the recordings, or certainly parts of them, numerous times in any event, I think it is advantageous that they have access to both versions, particularly where the listenability of the enhanced version makes that task less onerous. Accordingly, I decline to exercise the discretion to exclude the enhanced recording. It may be tendered before the jury.

2763604,HL v Regina; YG v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 43,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offence and Sentence
On 27 February 2012 the applicants pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count of demand money by force whilst in company of each other with intent to steal. The offence is contrary to s99(2) Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. There is no standard non-parole period.

3The applicants were juveniles at the time of the offence. It was an indictable offence, but not a serious children's indictable offence, as defined by s3 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Syme DCJ determined pursuant to s18(1)(b) of the Act to deal with the applicants in accordance with Division 4 of Part 3 of the Act, rather than according to law. 

4On 27 April 2012 her Honour, pursuant to s33(1)(e) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, sentenced each applicant to a period of probation for 12 months, commencing 27 April 2012. Her Honour recorded a conviction in relation to the offence against each applicant. 

5A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 15 May 2012. The appeal was filed on 1 August 2013. The grounds of appeal are:

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in that the strength of the Crown case was taken into account when assessing the discount for the plea of guilty.

Ground 2: The applicants suffer a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon them with the sentence imposed upon their co-offender, AT (a child).

Factual Background

6The following facts were agreed between the parties. In June 2010 the female victim, XS, met a person called RJ. The victim and RJ were Chinese students studying in Australia. Both were juveniles. They became involved in a relationship but after some weeks, the victim decided to end the relationship. A number of RJ's friends (including the two offenders) were unhappy with the way the victim had treated RJ. The two offenders considered that the victim should repay money which RJ had spent on her during their relationship. 

7On 11 August 2010 GE telephoned the victim and told her that she would be assaulted if she did not meet at Chatswood railway station on 13 August 2010. On that afternoon, the victim met GE at the railway station. They then caught a bus to the ""Forest Way"" shops. GE and the victim then walked to the house where RJ lived. RJ let the victim and GE into the house. Shortly thereafter some other people (including AT and the offenders) arrived at the house. 

8The victim was confronted about the way she had treated RJ during their relationship. One of the young people told the victim that she owed RJ $800 (being the money RJ had spent on her plus $400 ""interest""). The victim felt she was being bullied into paying the money. She indicated that she did not have the money. The offender YG (a female) dragged the victim from the couch where she was sitting. The victim indicated that she did not have the money but that she would get the money.

9While in the house, the victim ate dinner. After dinner, the offender YG told the victim to get off the couch. She complained that the victim was too slow and dragged her off the couch. One of the young people took two mobile phones belonging to the victim out of her bag. Later, AT contacted the victim's guardian and told the guardian that she would be staying with her for the night. At about 9pm the victim asked to leave the house. All of the persons present except RJ indicated that she could not leave. She spent the night at the house.

10On the morning of 14 August 2010 the victim left the house. Everyone from the house, except GE, walked with her to the ""Forest Way"" shops. The victim realised that she did not have her mobile phones. She was told that RJ would return them to her. Subsequently, arrangements were made to return the phones to the victim at the bus stop at the ""Forest Way"" shops.

11On 18 August 2010 after arriving at the bus stop, the victim spoke with RJ by mobile phone. RJ told her to meet him at the house. She went to the house to get her phones. When she got to the house (at about 3pm) RJ, the offender HL (a male), the offender YG, AT and another person were there. While sitting on the lounge, the offender HL crossed his legs and in so doing made contact with the left ear of the victim, causing it to bleed. The group appeared angry that she had (previously) recorded abusive and threatening conversations with them on her mobile phones. A short time later, GE arrived at the house and threw his jacket at the victim. The jacket hit her chest.

12The group abused the victim for recording the conversation. They asked her if she had the $800. She indicated that she did not. The offender YG then used scissors to try to cut the victim's hair causing her to scream. GE pushed her to the floor and put a cloth in her mouth to gag her. The offender YG used scissors to cut off an amount of the victim's hair causing her to cry. RJ asked the others to let her go but they refused. The offender stood close and spoke to the victim while she was leaning against the wall. She was then forced to write an ""IOU"" note indicating that she borrowed $800 from RJ and would return the money to him in two weeks. At about 6pm, the door of the house was opened and the victim was allowed to leave. RJ did not participate in the assault on the victim but neither did he try to stop it. The offender HL smashed one of her mobile phones.

13The victim caught a bus to Chatswood. At Chatswood she told her friend what had happened and the matter was reported to the police.

14The co-offender AT, whose sentence is relied upon for parity purposes, was aged 16 years and 9 months at the time of the offence, YG was aged 17 years and 10 months and HL 17 years and 6 months. AT was sentenced on 22 June 2011 at Bidura Children's Court. She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to an offence under s86(2) Crimes Act 1900 being an offence of take and detain a person in company with intent to obtain an advantage. On indictment that offence was punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment. The jurisdictional limit on the Children's Court was a control order for a maximum of 2 years. AT was sentenced to a 12 months period of probation, pursuant to the provisions of s33(1)(e) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. The learned magistrate declined to record a conviction pursuant to s14 of the Act.

Sentence proceedings

15Her Honour noted that although general sentencing principles would apply, the Children's Court (Criminal Proceedings) Act operated so that rehabilitation was to be given a greater emphasis.

16Although the offenders and the victim were all aged 17 at the time, her Honour concluded that general deterrence still had to be given some weight for the following reasons:

There were a number of people involved in the offence. 

The frightening nature of the offence. 

The degree of forethought that went into the offence. 

The offence continued over a period of three days.

17Pleas of guilty were entered and were accepted on the day of the trial. Before then they had proceeded to a committal stage in the Children's Court. Her Honour found that the offenders were entitled to a discount which could be ""reflected either in the length of the sentence imposed or by the nature of the sentence imposed"".

18In relation to the plea of guilty, her Honour said:

""A plea of guilty is sometimes taken into account as evidence of remorse and contrition. In this case there was a strong Crown case because of the statement of the victim, which probably affords the offenders less credit ... However neither offender gave evidence and the finding of their remorse, and therefore their prospects of rehabilitation, must therefore be guarded.""

19In relation to subjective matters, her Honour noted that neither offender had a criminal record in Australia or China. Neither offender gave evidence and no explanation was given for their involvement in the offence. The offenders were both students from China as was the co-offender and the victim. They came to Australia to finish their secondary studies and remained to enrol in tertiary studies. Her Honour noted that both offenders had parental, financial and emotional support, together with other support in Australia. A number of references from persons in Australia were placed before the court.

20Her Honour characterised the offence as ""frightening and demeaning for the victim. It was a frightening offence involving a number of offenders against a single victim."" (ROS 4.7) Her Honour did not regard factors of a cultural nature as an excuse, nor as an acceptable explanation for the serious criminal behaviour. She characterised the behaviour as aggressive and cowardly.

21Her Honour found that the offences were serious in that they involved a young victim. Although the violence was somewhat limited, there was a large degree of menace and fright. Injury by way of cut hair was inflicted. Her Honour accepted that there was little or no evidence of planning, over and above what might be usual for this sort of offence. She regarded the fact that the offending took place over three days and that the offenders were persistent in their endeavours, as an aggravating feature.

22In relation to mitigating factors, her Honour took into account the offenders' prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour did not see in the evidence or in the references any indication of regret or apology tendered to the victim. Her Honour could find no acknowledgement of any regret as to what the victim might have felt with respect to what happened to her. Her Honour took into account that each offender had spent a considerable time on reasonably strict bail conditions, including a curfew.

23Although the matter was to be dealt with under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, her Honour considered that the purposes of sentencing were important. She thought that it was important that each offender be adequately punished for their involvement in this offence and that in order to prevent crimes, it was necessary to send a message of general deterrence to the wider community. Her Honour accepted that as a result of the very long period that the offenders had been on bail, and the loss of face which they had suffered within their own community, specific deterrence had to some extent been dealt with. Her Honour took into account that the maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 14 years.

24In relation to parity, her Honour said:

""The other issue that I take into account is the issue of parity. A co-offender was dealt with in the Children's Court when she pleaded guilty to a similar, but more serious offence, in that jurisdiction. It was a notionally more serious offence, but the involvement of the co-offender and the actions undertaken by the co-offender, were quite similar. While I accept that the maximum penalties are to be used as a guide in sentence, it is each offender's involvement and their actions and the objective seriousness of the circumstances of the offence which is the most important consideration in sentence. Parity is therefore, in my view, an important consideration. 

The co-offender was involved in the same way. She pleaded at an early part in the proceedings and she was sentenced in a court with a different jurisdictional limit."" (ROS 7.5)

25In relation to whether a conviction should be recorded, her Honour said:

""With respect to the issue of conviction, I have considered this issue. This is a very serious offence. I note and observe that the person dealt with in the Children's Court did not have a conviction recorded against her. I am not bound by those Children's Court findings. I am of the view that to record a conviction for these two 19 year olds is appropriate, notwithstanding they were 17 years of age when this offence was committed. I take into account the serious nature of the behaviour and the circumstances of the offence. I take into account the need to address specific and more importantly, general deterrence, when imposing sentence."" (ROS 8.5)

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in that the strength of the Crown case was taken into account when assessing the discount for the plea of guilty.

26The applicants submitted that her Honour when referring to the strength of the Crown case was in fact referring to the utilitarian value of the plea rather than contrition and remorse. They submitted that such an approach was contrary to R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12] where Howie J (with whom Studdert and Dunford JJ agreed) said:

""12 This Court has pointed out, time and time again, that the strength of the Crown case is an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The strength of the Crown case is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse and what weight should be given to that factor in determining the appropriate sentence. ...""

Consideration

27The applicants' submission is misconceived. Properly read her Honour was only referring to the strength of the Crown case in the context of an assessment of remorse and contrition. She was not giving any consideration to the utilitarian value of the plea. Her Honour was saying nothing more than that the strength of the Crown case weakened the extent to which the applicants could rely upon their plea of guilty as indicating remorse and contrition. In treating the matter in that way, her Honour's observation was fully in accord with R v Sutton.

28This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2: The applicants suffer a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed upon them with the sentence imposed upon their co-offender, AT (a child).

29The applicants submitted that the recording of a conviction against them but not against AT constituted a marked and manifest disparity in sentencing so as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on their part. They submitted that a recorded conviction could have serious consequences for their careers. They submitted that in order to satisfy the parity principle, this Court should intervene to remove the conviction recorded against them.

30In support of that submission, the applicants relied upon the following matters: their ages and that of AT were generally similar, they were charged with a less serious offence, they like AT had pleaded guilty, they like AT had no criminal record and their subjective cases were very similar. The applicants also relied upon concessions made by the Crown in the sentence proceedings where the Crown accepted that parity existed between their circumstances and those of AT. 

31The applicants submitted that even though there were some differences between their circumstances and those of AT, the principle of proportionality needed to be applied. The applicants relied upon JM v R [2012] NSWCCA 83 where Simpson J (with whom Whealy JA and Hoeben J agreed) said:

""93 The second aspect of the observations extracted from Postiglione of present materiality is the question of proportionality. Even when differences, either in culpability, or in personal circumstances, or both, justify disparity in sentencing, then, nevertheless, due proportion between the sentences is to be applied.""

32The applicant also relied upon Sen v R [2013] NSWCCA 30 where Rothman J (McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing) said:

""21 As has been explained many times, the principle of parity in sentencing derives from the application of the fundamental principle of equal justice: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 463; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26l; 189 CLR 295 (Per Dawson and Gaudron JJ) at 301-302, citing with approval Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60.

22 Equal justice is a fundamental norm (Green, supra) and an essential aspect of natural justice. It requires that like should be treated alike, and that which is unalike should be treated unalike in proportion to their ""unalikeness"": Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia (1989) 1SCR 143 per McIntyre J citing Aristotle's Ethica Nicomachea; R v Tiddy (1969) SASR 575.""

33The applicants submitted that any factors applicable to them and distinguishable from AT that justified the recording of a conviction in their case did not exist. They submitted that the recording of a conviction in their case gave rise to a ""marked"", ""glaring"" and ""gross"" disparity that required the intervention of this Court.

Consideration

34I have concluded that the applicants do not have a justified sense of grievance when their circumstances and those of AT are considered in conformity with applicable principle. A sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 463 at [28].

35Contrary to the applicants' submissions, the age of AT was not generally similar. She was 12 months younger than YG and 9 months younger than HL. When considering lack of maturity and appreciation of the seriousness of offending, such an age difference at that time of life is significant.

36There was no evidence before the sentencing judge that either applicant had expressed any victim empathy, a matter which was noted by her Honour. In contrast, AT's background report stated that she ""displayed a high level of remorse and victim empathy"". It was accepted by the prosecutor that on the first occasion that the victim had been detained at the premises, AT had comforted her and provided her with some clothes to keep her warm as it was a cold evening.

37In contrast with AT, the agreed facts indicated that the applicants had used force to intimidate the victim. On two occasions, on 13 August 2010 YG had dragged the victim from a couch and on 18 August had cut the victim's hair causing her to cry. On 18 August HL had kicked the victim in the ear (perhaps inadvertently), had spoken to her in an apparently threatening way causing her to write an ""IOU"" and had smashed one of her mobile telephones.

38These matters provided a clear basis for her Honour differentiating between AT and the applicants. Even though the Crown had made a concession favouring the applicants, her Honour was not bound by that concession. On the contrary, her Honour was required to exercise her discretion quite independently of those submissions. It is clear from ([25] hereof) that her Honour gave particular attention to the question of whether a conviction should be recorded.

39In view of the very real differences between the circumstances surrounding the offending by AT and by the applicants, it cannot be said that her Honour did not properly apply the principle of parity. Because of those differences, it could not be said that the difference in the sentences could be properly characterised as ""gross"", ""marked"", ""glaring"" or ""manifest"".

40This ground has not been made out.

41The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed.

42BELLEW J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2763609,Boorer v HLB Mann Judd (NSW) Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 100,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Leeming JA that, for the reasons he gives, the Court should make the orders that he proposes.

2LEEMING JA: The primary judge dismissed Mr Boorer's claim after a four day trial in the last week of November 2012. Her Honour's reasons, promptly delivered on 6 December 2012, occupy 166 paragraphs over 44 pages. Her Honour resolved the central factual controversy, of how and why false information came to be lodged with ASIC by the respondent (HLB), unfavourably to Mr Boorer, based in part upon her unfavourable assessment of him during cross-examination. 

3Putting to one side a claim for misleading and deceptive conduct (which was not agitated on appeal), her Honour found there was no breach of a duty of care at common law in respect of two strands of Mr Boorer's case. Speaking generally, Mr Boorer alleged that HLB was under a duty of care requiring it (a) to lodge returns with ASIC properly and (b) to monitor the solvency of his company. Her Honour also found that if there had been a breach of duty in either respect, the breach caused no loss. 

4Mr Boorer appeals as of right to this Court, and at the forefront of his appeal is a Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 challenge to her Honour's determination of the critical contested issues of fact. Before turning to the ""real review of the trial"" that that entails, it is convenient to outline the factual background and identify the areas in dispute.

Overview of factual background

5Mr Boorer caused to be incorporated an unlisted public company, Techontap International Ltd, in 2003. His evidence at trial was that he knew that, as a public company, Techontap was subject to ""far higher standards of corporate governance"", including an annual audit and having at least three directors, than a proprietary company. He consciously chose a public company structure because he intended ""to raise significant external capital from sophisticated investors and institutions"". He also said that he hoped at some stage to float Techontap on the Australian Stock Exchange.

6A company which appoints a person to act as a director must first obtain that person's signed consent. The company must keep the consent. A public company must have at least one secretary (although a proprietary company need not). A company which appoints a secretary must first obtain that person's signed consent, and, once again, the company must keep it. A company must lodge with ASIC a notice in the prescribed form (Form 484) within 28 days of appointing a director or secretary. A person must not lodge a document with ASIC which is, to the person's knowledge, false in a material respect. Those obligations are contained in ss 201D(1), 201D(2), 204A(1), 204C(1), 204C(2), 205B(1) and 1308(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Contravention of any is an offence: ss 1311(1) and 1308(2). 

7These are basic aspects of corporate regulation in this country. 

8Irrespective of how the controversial facts underlying this litigation are resolved, there have been sustained contraventions of each of those provisions. Taking the most charitable view, neither Mr Boorer, nor Ms Mariana Von Lucken, who was at relevant times an employee of HLB, was aware of those offences. It should be added that it was no part of either party's case that there had been deliberate wrongdoing; indeed, when the primary judge raised the seriousness of intentionally misleading ASIC, counsel for Mr Boorer said ""We don't have to go that far. I pulled out before I got to that stage.""

9Techontap retained HLB to provide a variety of accounting, taxation, auditing and company secretariat services, including preparing and lodging forms with ASIC from time to time. It was common ground at the trial and on appeal that HLB owed Mr Boorer (personally) a duty of care in relation to the forms lodged with ASIC, although the content of that duty of care was in issue. In its amended defence, HLB alleged that its duty was discharged when it prepared and lodged forms with ASIC in accordance with Mr Boorer's instructions. Mr Boorer contended for a broader duty of care. There was competing expert evidence, not fully resolved by the primary judge, as to the content of the duty of care.

10It was uncontroversial that HLB arranged for Techontap to use its premises as that company's registered office in Sydney, that HLB was Techontap's tax agent and prepared tax returns and, importantly for this appeal, was Techontap's registered agent with ASIC, prepared and lodged ASIC forms, maintained company registers, and prepared minutes of meetings of Techontap's board. HLB was also appointed as Techontap's auditor in December 2003 (s 327A of the Corporations Act required a public company to appoint an auditor within one month of its registration as a company); however it was common ground that no statutory audit was ever undertaken.

11On 10 May 2004, Mr Boorer advised Ms Von Lucken that one of the three directors of Techontap, and its secretary, had that day offered his resignation. Following the resignation, the remaining directors of Techontap were Mr Boorer and his son.

(a) The purported appointments of Messrs Leonard and Brett King

12Mr Boorer then invited Mr Leonard King and his son Brett to become directors, with Mr Leonard King as secretary. Mr Leonard King lived in Melbourne, and Mr Brett King in Hong Kong. The primary judge found that both Messrs Leonard and Brett King were willing to become directors of Techontap, so long as sufficient capital had first been raised. The primary judge found that, shortly before 22 July 2004, Mr Boorer telephoned Ms Von Lucken and asked her to prepare directors' consents for Messrs Walter Adamson and Leonard and Brett King. Emails from each of those three men, stating their dates and places of birth and addresses, were forwarded to Ms Von Lucken. For example, on 22 or 23 July 2004, Mr Boorer wrote to Ms Von Lucken, copied to Mr Leonard King:

""Mariana,

Leonard King has consented to be director/secretary techontap International Limited - can you please provide consent form to him and register accordingly.

You will note his company, Kingston Group, has shares that also need issuing as per spreadsheet.

Nearly there!

Graeme""

13Ms Von Lucken caused to be prepared minutes of a directors' meeting of Techontap held on 26 July 2004 at 10am dealing with the allotment of shares and the appointment of three directors and a secretary. Each appointment was in the same terms; for example, in the case of Mr Leonard King, the minutes provided:

""•  IT WAS RESOLVED that Leonard Keith King, who has consented to the appointment, be appointed Director to take effect from today.""

14The document prepared by Ms Von Lucken was signed by Mr Boorer. He did so in a meeting with Ms Von Lucken on 28 July 2004. At the same meeting, Mr Boorer signed a Form 484 notifying ASIC of the appointment of Mr Adamson and Messrs Leonard and Brett King as directors and of Mr Leonard King as secretary.

15There is no suggestion in the evidence that Mr Boorer knew that it was an offence for a company to appoint a director or secretary without first obtaining that person's consent in writing. There is no suggestion in the evidence that Ms Von Lucken knew that it was an offence for Techontap to have appointed those men without first obtaining their written consent, or that she ever advised Mr Boorer of the obligations and offences created by ss 201D and 204C. Indeed, there is but scant suggestion in the evidence that there was an actual meeting, or even a telephone meeting, between the remaining two directors of Techontap, Mr Boorer and his son, at 10am on 26 July 2004. Mr Boorer's first affidavit stated that he ""totally relied upon Ms Von Lucken"", and did not read the bundle of about 80 pages held together with a bulldog clip provided by her, but instead merely signed where he had been asked to sign. Although Ms Von Lucken swore that she recalled being told by Mr Boorer that he intended to have a directors' meeting on 26 July 2004, Mr Boorer denied that any such conversation occurred.

16The primary judge found that on 28 July 2004, although Ms Von Lucken had the signed minute of the directors' meeting of 26 July 2004, and the signed Form 484, she knew that none of the three men had signed consents. At some time in the next fortnight before lodging the Form 484, Ms Von Lucken received a consent form signed by Mr Adamson. Despite repeated requests by Ms Von Lucken, consents from Messrs Leonard and Brett King were not forthcoming.

17There was a dispute at trial, which is central to this appeal, as to the terms of the conversations between Mr Boorer and Ms Von Lucken over this period. The primary judge found (and this finding is strongly challenged on appeal) that Mr Boorer instructed her to lodge the form with ASIC in these terms:

""I promise to chase them up, but please lodge the forms with ASIC now so that I am not in breach of the Act.""

18There is no dispute that the Form 484 was lodged on 12 August 2004, and that thereafter ASIC's records were amended so as to reflect that Messrs Leonard and Brett King were directors of Techontap and Mr Leonard King its secretary. On the same day Ms Von Lucken's assistant sent a handwritten note to Mr Leonard King in these terms:

""Dear Mr King,

Enclosed are letters of consent to appoint yourself as Director & Secretary of Techontap International Limited. Also enclosed is a letter from the Kingstone Group Pty Limited applying for the allotment of 625 founders shares. Would you please sign these documents and return them to this office. It would be greatly appreciated if you would arrange for Brett to sign the documents where appropriate. Should you have any queries, please contact me on (02) 9020 XXXX.

Mariana Von-Lucken.""

(b) The realisation that Messrs Leonard and Brett King were not validly appointed

19Some months later, on 29 March 2005, Mr Adamson resigned, purportedly with effect from 15 March 2005. On 30 March 2005, Mr Boorer asked Ms Von Lucken to effect Mr Adamson's resignation as at 15 March.

20After March 2005, Techontap only had two directors, instead of the three which Mr Boorer and Ms Von Lucken well knew were required, unless (as was recorded in ASIC's register) Messrs Leonard and Brett King had been appointed directors. After May 2004, Techontap had no company secretary, as required by s 204A, unless (as was recorded in ASIC's register) Mr Leonard King had been appointed secretary. During the trial, it was common ground that Messrs Leonard and Brett King never consented to be appointed, and were not in fact appointed, as directors or (in the case of Mr Leonard King) secretary. What was disputed was when each of Mr Boorer and Ms Von Lucken appreciated that fact.

21A related issue at trial, which was also prominent in the appeal, was as to the time when Mr Boorer learned that no signed consent forms had been received by HLB. The primary judge found that Mr Boorer knew this on 30 September 2004, and was critical of that and other aspects of his evidence (it will be necessary to return to this below). However, it was uncontroversial that Mr Boorer knew the true position by the end of May 2005.

22On 28 May 2005 Mr Boorer sent an email to Mr Brett King which included the following:

""...however recently I saw a ASIC company print out and saw you listed as a director of Techontap International Limited - did you sign Consent to Act as Director forms? If so I sincerely apologise for not keeping you across matters. If you did, then Ruben Simon Boorer (my eldest son) you and I are the three directors. (Walter resigned two months ago)

Sam Seabury, whom Dad introduced, will not accept appointment until funding is in place, however he is proving a solid CEO and has the discipline, determination and loyalty to manage high growth that I believe will come once the business plan is funded. 

That said Techontap is dangerously close to being insolvent and so Sam and my efforts are focussed on raising a Stage One Convertible Note for $AUD250,000 and $AUD1.25 Stage Two for 20% equity. Stage One is needed asap and while we have $500K from R&D Grants due by 22 July, we are running close to the wind.""

23On 30 May 2005 there was an exchange of emails between Mr Boorer and Mr Brett King. Mr Brett King said that he had ""confirmed with Dad that neither he nor I consented to directorship for [Techontap]."" Mr Boorer responded:

""That is a relief! Will action to ensure ASIC reflects that - and how come your name appears. Mann Judd may have mistakenly submitted forms, certainly without my approval.""

24The primary judge found that notwithstanding this exchange of emails, the plaintiff took no action to rectify the ASIC records. Her Honour rejected Mr Boorer's evidence that he promptly forgot about his promise to rectify ASIC's records.

25Techontap's balance sheet as at June 2005 (the version in evidence had been provided to Mr Boorer on 1 September 2005) showed a precarious financial position. Its current liabilities exceeded $322,000. Although its current assets were some $405,000, $396,000 reflected a ""R&D Claim Receivable"". On 2 September 2005, HLB had lodged a tax return claiming an R&D tax offset of $385,420.80. Around 22 September, HLB received that refund and remitted $339,000 to Mr Boorer (HLB retained some $46,000, reflecting $36,000 of work performed and $10,000 for future work). The following Monday 26 September 2005, Mr Boorer caused an administrator to be appointed to Techontap.

26Also in September 2005, Mr Leonard King wrote to ASIC saying that neither he nor his son Brett had consented to being appointed as officers of Techontap. Mr Boorer forwarded Mr Leonard King's email to Ms Von Lucken under this email:

""Mariana,

Len King is quite upset over the matter below - and rightly so. He has never signed Consent to act as Director - neither has his son Brett.

Can you please advise urgently how this matter can be corrected?

Best regards,

Graeme.""

27There was a further dispute at trial, and on appeal, as to the conversations between Mr Boorer, Mr Leonard King and Ms Von Lucken in September and early October 2005; principally this was relevant as bearing upon the primary judge's finding that Mr Boorer, on 12 August 2004, had instructed Ms Von Lucken to lodge the Form 484. Mr Leonard King said that Ms Von Lucken had acknowledged that she had made an error, for which she would take full responsibility, when the Form 484 was lodged. He gave evidence and was cross-examined about his recollection. The primary judge found at [55]:

""I do not accept Mr King's evidence about this conversation. I am satisfied that Ms Von-Lucken told him that she would investigate the documentation and also that she was prepared to inform ASIC that there had been an error. However, I am not satisfied that she admitted that it was her mistake or that she was responsible for it. As I have found above, Ms Von Lucken did what the plaintiff had instructed her to do. She had no reason to admit that she had made a mistake and I am satisfied that no such admission was made.""

(c) Winding up of Techontap and disqualification of Mr Boorer

28Techontap was wound up on 14 December 2005. That, together with his having been a director of two other companies to which a liquidator was appointed in March and October 2004 (and whose unsecured creditors were expected by the liquidators to receive 0 cents in the dollar: see s 533(1)(c)) engaged ASIC's power under s 206F to disqualify Mr Boorer. ASIC conducted a hearing under s 51 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) on 27 May 2008 on the question whether he should be disqualified. Following that hearing, on 27 June 2008, ASIC issued a notice of disqualification, preventing him from managing corporations without the leave of ASIC for two years. The disqualification was published on the ASIC website and received some publicity. The disqualification was, in part, based upon a finding that Mr Boorer had misled ASIC by signing the Form 484 and providing it to HLB. ASIC's delegate said:

""...in view of Mr Boorer's experience as a director of 10 companies, I do not find it credible that he signed dated forms appointing Brett King and Leonard King as directors without understanding what he was doing, particularly as the relevant form has large headings indicating that the purpose of the form is to appoint a company officeholder.

Mr Boorer has not provided evidence to support his assertion that HLB Mann Judd lodged the documents contrary to Mr Boorer's instructions. He must have returned the duly signed forms to HLB Mann Judd in order for them to have lodged the forms with ASIC. In the absence of documentary evidence to the contrary, the conclusion I draw is that the forms were lodged on Mr Boorer's instructions.""

29However, there were other matters on which the delegate relied. The liquidators' reports complained of the absence of proper books and records. Three companies failed, and creditors were unpaid. The delegate observed that in the absence of good record keeping, Mr Boorer could not know the financial position of his companies. 

30Mr Boorer sought review from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, constituted by the Hon B Tamberlin QC, Deputy President. On 26 May 2010, the AAT set aside ASIC's decision and replaced it with a decision that Mr Boorer be disqualified from managing corporations for a period of one year, operative from 27 June 2008: Boorer v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2010] AATA 390. It seems that no stay of ASIC's disqualification was sought, and so, for practical purposes, Mr Boorer was unable to manage corporations from 27 June 2008 until 26 May 2010. In concluding that a lesser period of disqualification was the correct or preferable decision, the Tribunal accepted evidence from Mr Boorer and Mr Leonard King (the latter does not appear to have provided evidence to ASIC's delegate) that there had been an error on the part of HLB in the lodgement of the Form 484. The reasons record that:

""38. Mr King states that an employee of HLB Mann Judd admitted that she had not received consent forms signed by Brett or Leonard King and that lodgement with ASIC showing them as directors was an error on their part. Having regard to the evidence of Mr King, I am satisfied that the misleading statement was made, but that it was explicable by a fact that arose from an error on the part of the accountants and miscommunications which were not intentional. I find that no adverse conclusion can be drawn as to the conduct of Mr Boorer in relation to this matter. I accept that it was an honest mistake.
...

46. I do not accept that he has engaged in blameworthy, false or misleading conducting in relation to the lodgement of documents nominating Mr Leonard King and Mr Brett King as directors. Incorrect statements were made but they were consequence of an honest mistake.""

Nevertheless, the Tribunal was satisfied that there were significant breaches by Mr Boorer in failing to keep and conserve adequate financial records and in allowing Techontap to trade while it was insolvent.

The claim against HLB based on insolvent trading

31At trial, Mr Boorer advanced a claim of breach of duty by HLB, in failing to warn him that he was, or might have been, trading while insolvent. Her Honour addressed the case as it had been advanced in particulars extending outside the scope of the pleading (although no amendment had been sought) and concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish any breach of duty, and had also failed to establish that there would have been any difference had advice been given that Techontap was, or might be, trading while insolvent: at [114]-[134]. 

32None of the ten grounds of appeal challenged the finding of failure to establish breach of any duty in relation to insolvent trading. Although two paragraphs (paragraphs 53 and 54) of Mr Boorer's written submissions on the appeal pointed to error in relation to that finding, the respondent's written submissions filed 20 December 2013 correctly stated that breach of duty in relation to insolvent trading was ""not a matter raised in any of the grounds of appeal"", and, even if it were, there was no challenge to the finding of no causation. The written submissions also indicated that HLB's retainer was limited and did not give it access to current financial information pertaining to Techontap's solvency, such that HLB did not have an opportunity, let alone a responsibility, to assess Techontap's solvency. Both of those matters were findings made by the primary judge, and neither was challenged in the notice of appeal.

33The appeal was listed for hearing on 25 March 2014. On the day before the appeal was listed to be heard, a proposed amended notice of appeal was provided to the respondent and leave was granted to rely upon it at the commencement of the appeal. The amended notice of appeal did not challenge the findings of no breach and no causation in relation to insolvent trading. 

34After the luncheon adjournment, a further application to amend, so as to challenge the findings in relation to insolvent trading, was made. Leave was refused, on the basis that reasons would be given when judgment on the appeal was delivered. 

35I joined in that order (a) because counsel for the respondent claimed that she was prejudiced by the belated raising of these additional grounds, (b) because, on its face, that claim was plausible, the grounds requiring a review of a deal of evidence and submissions otherwise not mentioned in the parties' written and oral submissions on the appeal, and (c) because no explanation was provided for the lateness of the application, in circumstances where the appellant had been squarely on notice for nearly three months and had supplied a proposed amended notice of appeal not extending to these grounds on the previous day. The obligations in ss 56-58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) all point squarely against the grant of leave; the amendment, if allowed, would unquestionably have led to further written submissions, if not the need for additional oral submissions. The only available inference is that there had been a deliberate forensic choice in the months preceding the hearing of the appeal not to expand its scope. There comes a time in litigation when it is too late to renounce deliberate forensic choices cf Levy v Bablis [2012] NSWCA 128 at [70]; Warth v Lafsky [2014] NSWCA 94 at [71]-[80]. That time was well and truly reached by 2.15pm on the afternoon of the hearing of the appeal.

Findings on causation and loss connected with the Form 484

36Putting to one side the insolvent trading claim, her Honour made findings on causation and damages regarding the lodgement of the Form 484 at [153]-[157]. It is convenient to reproduce them in full, for two reasons. The first is that only if they are successfully set aside is there an occasion for this Court ordering a retrial. Counsel for Mr Boorer candidly and properly conceded that this was a case where, if appellable error were established, this Court could not determine the outcome. There would need to be a retrial. But this Court must not order a new trial unless it appears that ""some substantial wrong or miscarriage"" has occurred: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR), r 51.53(1).

37The second is that there are cases where a successful challenge to factual findings undermining a conclusion of no breach might of themselves undermine findings of causation and loss, because those latter findings are infected by the earlier erroneous approach. Although this was not squarely put on behalf of Mr Boorer, it was arguably implicit in the submissions advanced. 

38Her Honour found (at [149]-[150]) that CCI's unwillingness to re-engage Mr Boorer after his contract expired had nothing to do with the disqualification. Her Honour continued as follows:

""153 Had the defendant refused to lodge the Form 484 until the written consents had been received, then the plaintiff would still have been disqualified under s 206F from managing a corporation for a year, since this was what the AAT decided was the appropriate length of disqualification: Boorer and Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2010] AATA 390.

154 The plaintiff submitted that his loss of income ought be assessed by reference to figures in the order paid by CCI to CSI referred to above. I accept the defendant's submission that this contract was, in the plaintiff's career, an outlier. There is no evidence to establish that this contract with CCI was other than an extraordinarily lucrative period in an otherwise relatively unremunerative working life. Furthermore, for reasons given above, I am not satisfied that the cause of cessation of the CCI work had anything to do with the Disqualification.

155 The next question that arises is whether the opprobrium of being disqualified for managing companies that did not have sufficient capital to meet their obligations and failing to keep adequate books and records is significantly less than the opprobrium of those matters together with the opprobrium of authorising a document to be lodged with ASIC which showed persons as directors when they had not consented in breach of s 1308 of the Corporations Act. The plaintiff submitted that the additional ground carried a significant additional stigma since it impugned the plaintiff's reputation for honesty and integrity, in a way that record-keeping and under-capitalisation did not.

156 I accept that the effect on the plaintiff's reputation for honesty and integrity of a finding of misleading and deceptive conduct would be substantial and that, conceivably, it would affect his capacity to earn in roles for which honesty and integrity were prerequisites. It does not, however, seem to me that the role that the plaintiff, through CSI, performed for CCI required such qualities, or that the role the plaintiff performed through CS previously, required such qualities. His role in both instances was essentially technical and involved him in assisting clients to set up systems and databases and use them effectively.

157 In any event, for the reasons given above, there is no basis for concluding that but for the Disqualification, CCI would have offered him more work.

...

162 The plaintiff has adduced no reliable evidence that any diminution of earning capacity that he has suffered as a result of the defendant's (assumed) negligence, has or will be productive of economic loss.

163 While the plaintiff was disqualified, he could not be a director, or manage a company. There is no evidence of his being a director of a company other than one of which he was a major shareholder. He did not put his case on the basis that he ought be awarded a buffer for the loss of opportunity to be a director of companies of which he was not a shareholder. In all the circumstances, I do not consider that I should award a buffer.

164 Nor am I satisfied that work such as the work that the plaintiff was performing through CS, and later CSI, would not have been as available to him after the Disqualification as it was prior to the Disqualification.

165 For these reasons, even had I been satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to success on damages, I would not have awarded him more than nominal damages.""

39The ""CCI work"" referred to was consultancy work performed by Mr Boorer for the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry pursuant to a consultancy agreement which expired in August 2008.

Grounds 8-10 of the amended notice of appeal

40Grounds 8, 9 and 10 deal with damages. They are in these terms:

(8)Her Honour erred in failing to infer that disqualification by ASIC would affect the appellant's standing in the market place.

(9)Her Honour erred in not applying or not correctly applying the principles enunciated by the High Court in Husher v Husher (1999) 197 CLR 138 in regard to the loss of earning capacity of the appellant.

(10)Her Honour erred in finding that the appellant's income received from the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was not representative of the appellant's earning capacity and in finding that the engagement with that entity was ""an extraordinarily lucrative period in an otherwise relatively unremunerative working life"".

41Ground 8 is not made out. Her Honour did, expressly, accept that the plaintiff's reputation would be affected by ASIC's order and that ""conceivably, it would affect his capacity to earn in roles in which honesty and integrity were prerequisites"": at [156]. 

42More importantly, even if ground 8 were made out, it does not undermine the ultimate finding that there was no loss. It was established conclusively by the decision of the AAT that Mr Boorer should be disqualified from managing the affairs of corporations, albeit for a period of one year, for matters expressly unrelated to anything to do with the lodgement of the Form 484. True it is that if Mr Boorer's income were dependent upon his being able to be a company director, the additional year's disqualification would matter. But there was no evidence that he was denied income by reason of his being disqualified for an additional year. It was not part of Mr Boorer's case that he lost any income from being unable to act as a director between 26 June 2009 (the date of expiry of the one year disqualification) and 26 May 2010 (when the AAT set aside the two year disqualification and substituted a period of one year.

43Similarly, there was no evidence before her Honour of any differential impact upon Mr Boorer's reputation between a one year period of disqualification and a two year period of disqualification. Nor is that in any way surprising. Mr Boorer tendered an email from a prospective business partner who said:

""Graeme part of my job is to make sure that who I partner with is ethically sound so to do this I obviously carry out research as much as possible [sic]. 

I'm not sure that this is you but there seems to be an issue with a G.J.Boorer with ASIC, would you like to expand on this comment. 

I'm really sorry to have had to raise this.""

44It is obvious that it was the fact of the disqualification, rather than its length or the reasons for it, which was critical to Mr Boorer's reputation. Even if the reasons for it were made available, it is easy to see that a prospective commercial partner would be much more concerned by his consistent history of holding office in companies that fail, and trade while insolvent, and fail to keep records, as opposed to the lodging of an erroneous Form 484. 

45Ground 9 was not the subject of any written submissions, as was pointed out in the respondent's written submissions. Ground 9 was not addressed orally either. It is to be taken as abandoned.

46Ground 10 was not advanced in writing or orally. Even if it were made out, it did not matter. Her Honour's finding was that the CCI contract came to an end, and Mr Boorer's subsequent employment and income was unaffected by the disqualification. No basis was advanced to challenge her Honour's finding that the work performed by the plaintiff for CCI, and subsequently, was not affected by the disqualification.

47Accordingly, the limited challenge to the findings of no loss fails. Moreover, the findings are unaffected by the outcome of the balance of appeal, challenging the findings of breach. They are independent of the unfavourable credit findings made by her Honour, and the fact-finding process used in relation to breach. 

48Test the matter this way. Suppose, in accordance with Mr Boorer's case on appeal, and contrary to the credit-based factual findings of the primary judge, Ms Von Lucken was in breach of her obligations to him when she lodged the Form 484, and suppose as he and his witness said, she accepted that it was her fault. The fact of the matter is that Techontap failed, no differently from other companies managed by Mr Boorer, he was disqualified by ASIC and the AAT determined that the disqualification, for matters unrelated to the false Form 484, was appropriate. Even if factual findings were made wholly in his favour on questions going to breach of duty, Mr Boorer would nevertheless fail to establish his tortious cause of action unless somehow he could demonstrate that there was loss of income or reputation by reason of the reliance by ASIC's delegate on the lodgement of the false Form 484. But there was no viable challenge to her Honour's findings on loss, and those findings are both inherently plausible and independent of any errors in the fact-finding process relevant to breach of duty.

49Had this been a case where there remained on the record a disqualification order based upon a finding that Mr Boorer had misled ASIC when the Form 484 was lodged, then, conceivably, it might have been appropriate to remit the matter for retrial if Fox v Percy error had otherwise been made out. At least in principle, there can be a ""substantial wrong or miscarriage"" within the meaning of UCPR r 51.53 even if no pecuniary consequences flow from it. But that is not this case. The only order damaging Mr Boorer's reputation that is extant is an order which expressly (and contrary to the findings of the primary judge) exonerates Mr Boorer from culpable conduct in relation to the lodgement of the Form 484.

The balance of the appeal

50On this basis alone, the appeal must be dismissed. Nevertheless, because of the importance of the issues to both parties, in deference to the submissions received by this Court, and in compliance with Kuru v New South Wales [2008] HCA 26; 236 CLR 1 at [12], I turn to the balance of the appeal.

51The obligation as stated in Kuru is not to deal with all grounds of appeal, even those which are unnecessary to the outcome, but to consider whether to deal with them. It is possible to deal in detail with most of the specific challenges to findings of fact advanced on appeal, and to do so relatively concisely, and I do so below. There are large questions as to breach, which were not argued before this Court at all, nor fully determined by her Honour. Although they cannot alter the outcome of this appeal, the impact of their resolution by this Court on other litigation is unknown. All those considerations point to a more restrained approach on some of the more general questions that arise.

52Rather than dealing with the grounds in the order in which they appear, it is more convenient to deal with the issues the subject of challenge on appeal.

(a) Did the primary judge err in finding that Mr Boorer instructed Ms Von Lucken to lodge the Form 484? (grounds 1 and 3)

53Mr Boorer denied that he instructed Ms Von Lucken to submit the Form 484. In his submissions on the appeal, it was put that it was inherently unlikely that he would have done so. It was said that ""all that needed to be done was for Ms Von Lucken to remove the two pages in relation to the Kings and send the form to ASIC with only Mr Adamson's page"". It was said that it took many years before Ms Von Lucken first stated that she had lodged the forms because she had been so instructed. One obvious time for her to have done so was in September 2005, when complaint was made to ASIC about the errors in the forms and there was a meeting about it. Although there was a dispute as to whether at that time she had told Mr Leonard King that it was entirely her fault, there was no suggestion that she said at that time that she only lodged the form because she was instructed to do so. 

54Mr Boorer's submissions complain that:

""On 12 August 2004 Ms Von Lucken knew that she had a method available to her to fulfil her duty to Techontap, by removing the pages relevant to the Kings and lodging the Form 484 in relation to Mr Adamson only. She was in breach of her duty by lodging the offending forms.

The trial judge appears never to have realised that the breach was not in putting in the Adamson form, but in failing to remove the King forms before lodgement; had that been done there would have been no breach."" 

55The authors of those submissions focus upon just one breach: the continuing obligation of a public company to have three directors: s 201A(2). No regard is paid to the totality of the unlawful conduct, which could not be cured by lodging pages 1, 2 and 5 of the Form 484. There would still be an ongoing breach of s 204A(2): public companies must have a secretary. Further, it is far from clear that lodging part of a form which had been signed by Mr Boorer, which reflected only one of the four appointments (three as directors, one as secretary) which were purportedly the subject of Techontap's resolution on 26 July 2004, would not contravene s 1308(2). 

56The short point is that contrary to Mr Boorer's written and oral submissions, there was no easy step for Ms Von Lucken to take on 12 August 2004 which would prevent breaches of the Corporations Act.

57However, taking an approach which reflects the parties' seeming ignorance of many of their legal obligations, let it be assumed that Mr Boorer and Ms Von Lucken knew only that ASIC must not be misled and that Techontap required three directors. It does not follow that it was ""glaringly improbable"" for Mr Boorer to have instructed Ms Von Lucken to have lodged the form. 

58The fact that on the same day that the form was lodged, a handwritten note was sent to Mr Leonard King requesting his consent, in circumstances where there had been repeated requests for his signed consent, makes it not implausible that the only reason that Ms Von Lucken lodged the form was that she was asked or instructed by Mr Boorer to do so. Far from amounting to a glaring improbability that would entitle an appellate court to set aside the factual finding of the trial judge, it is hard to think why Ms Von Lucken would lodge a document, knowing that signed consents were required, and knowing of her obligation not to mislead ASIC, unless Mr Boorer was placing pressure upon her to do so. It seems very unlikely that it was a miscommunication or administrative error. But the short point is that Mr Boorer's submission did not discharge the heavy burden to challenge a factual finding made by the primary judge.

(b) Did the primary judge err in finding that Mr Boorer knew by 30 September 2004 that signed consents had not been obtained? (ground 3A)

59The primary judge said that Mr Boorer knew by 30 September 2004 that no signed consents had been lodged by Messrs Leonard and Brett King. That finding was based upon a misreading of two emails of that date, sent to Techontap's in-house accountant and copied to Mr Boorer. The emails dealt with the shareholders of Techontap. In its first few months of existence, Techontap had issued shares and there had been some transfers. The email attached a list of shareholders, stated that the last five issues of shares had not been advised to ASIC as signed forms had not been returned, and ""Similarly, we have not been provided with the signed share certificates for these transfers, or the letters of consent"". It is quite plain that the reference is to shareholder consents, not directors' consents. (The fact that Ms Von Lucken's affidavit made the same mistake, as to which she was not cross-examined, is neither here nor there.) Accordingly, her Honour erred at [38] and [39] when she said:

""By email dated 30 September 2004, the defendant wrote to Mr Crewe-Brown requesting 'letters of consent'. I infer that the reference to such documents was a reference to the consent forms from Messrs King which were still outstanding. Mr Crewe-Brown forwarded the email to the plaintiff. In Mr Crewe-Brown's covering email to the plaintiff he added:

'Are you following up the matters relating to the signing of forms?'

These documents establish that as at 30 September 2004, the plaintiff knew that no consent forms had been received by the defendant. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff himself had received signed consent forms from Messrs King, or indeed that such forms were ever signed. Accordingly, the plaintiff knew that, although they had earlier indicated that they would consent to becoming directors, they were not prepared to sign consent forms and therefore were not in fact willing to be directors of Techontap.""

60It must be said that her Honour was led to that finding by the express submission of counsel appearing for HLB, which was not contradicted at the time by counsel appearing for Mr Boorer. 

61However, although that matter was capable of influencing her Honour's assessment of credibility (for Mr Boorer claimed that he did not appreciate that the signed consents of Messrs Leonard and Brett King had not been provided), her Honour did not return to the matter when she came to address credibility. Instead, her Honour relied on other contradictions between Mr Boorer's evidence and the contemporaneous documents, the lack of internal consistency in Mr Boorer's evidence, his credibility in relation to peripheral matters (such as when Techontap's lease commenced) and his demeanour: at [93]-[101]. I would not regard her Honour's error in relation to the 30 September 2004 email as materially contributing to her Honour's assessment of credibility: see Riley v The Owners - Strata Plan 73817 [2012] NSWCA 410 at [52]. Ample support remains: see Xu v Jinhong Design and Constructions Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 277 at [63].

(c) Did the primary judge err in failing to accept Mr Leonard King's evidence that Ms Von Lucken admitted she had made an error in September and October 2005? (grounds 4 and 5)

62On the disputed conversations in September and October 2005, Mr Boorer was critical of her Honour's reasoning at [55] set out above.

63It was said in written and oral submissions that Mr King had not been challenged as to his recollection. That is not so: it was squarely put that Ms Von Lucken had not said that she had made a clerical error, but rather that she needed to look at the file because she had not seen that part of the file for over a year. Mr King's answer was ""It may be. I don't think so"". An email from Ms Von Lucken to Mr King of 13 October 2005 and an email on the same day from Mr King to Mr Boorer (in which Mr King said that he had not yet heard from Ms Von Lucken ""as promised"") tend to support Ms Von Lucken's evidence. Neither email contains any indication that Ms Von Lucken had admitted that she lodged the Form 484 with ASIC in error.

64There was more force in the criticism of her Honour's reasoning that Ms Von Lucken had no reason to admit she had made a mistake. It is perfectly clear that Ms Von Lucken had made a series of mistakes, in failing to advise Mr Boorer of the obligations to which he and his son and his company were subject. It was wrong for them to purport to appoint any director without first obtaining his written consent. It was wrong for the Form 484 to be lodged without consent having been provided. Far from being remarkable for Ms Von Lucken to have admitted that she had made an error, it would have been the truth. (To be sure, it appears as though the trial was run without reference to the basic provisions of the Corporations Act to which reference has been made above.)

65Even so, I do not think that Mr Boorer has surmounted the heavy onus he bears in displacing the primary judge's demeanour-based findings.

(d) Did her Honour err in not finding that there was a breach of duty when the Form 484 was lodged in the knowledge that signed consents were not obtained? (ground 2)

66Her Honour concluded that there was no breach of duty in the circumstances of this case where Ms Von Lucken followed Mr Boorer's instructions. Even on the factual findings made by her Honour, I respectfully disagree with that conclusion. To my mind it is obvious that Ms Von Lucken was wrong - in the sense that there was a prima facie breach of federal law - to lodge the Form 484 knowing that written consents for two of the directors and the secretary had not been obtained. It was not seriously contended to the contrary.

67That conclusion does not of itself mean that there is a breach of the private law duty to take reasonable care she owed to Mr Boorer. It would be one thing if Mr Boorer well knew of the obligations and offences created by ss 201D, 204A, 204C and 205B. If Ms Von Lucken believed that he knew all of those things, and nevertheless instructed her to lodge a document which was false or misleading, then while she would still herself be in breach of the Corporations Act, she would not be liable to him for breach of a duty at common law. 

68However, where as here it is plain that Mr Boorer was ignorant of the obligations imposed by the Corporations Act, I would not lightly accept that following his instructions discharged her duty. Plainly enough, one of the reasons Techontap was paying HLB thousands of dollars in fees was for her to take reasonable care to ensure compliance with the Act.

69What precisely was the duty was not explored in any detailed way in written or oral submissions in this Court. Competing expert evidence was given at trial. It was not resolved by her Honour, because of the narrower duty formulated by her Honour, and the factual finding that Mr Boorer had instructed Ms Von Lucken to lodge the form. While the precise content of the duty is an important question, it does not matter in this case because, even in the event of my finding it was breached, there was no loss. In the circumstances, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to say anything further about it. I do not consider that anything in Kuru requires any different course.

(e) Remaining grounds of appeal

70Ground 6 asserts that her Honour erred ""in not attributing to the respondent an independent statutory duty not to mislead and deceive ASIC under s 1308 of the Corporations Act"". No submissions, in writing or orally, were made in support of it, and I take it to have been abandoned. 

71Ground 6A was a challenge to her Honour's decision to permit a question to be asked of Ms Von Lucken in re-examination. On the face of the transcript, the witness had given inconsistent answers. Mr Boorer has not demonstrated that putting the question was outside the latitude afforded to the trial judge. In any event, Ms Von Lucken's answer makes no difference to any aspect of the appeal.

72Ground 7 asserted error in ""not finding that the actions of the respondent were causative of loss and damage to the appellant"". In circumstances where her Honour found no breach, and no loss, and where the appellant accepted there must be a retrial, it is not possible to take this ground any further.

Orders

73I propose that the appeal be dismissed, with costs.

74SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with the orders proposed by Leeming JA and with his Honour's reasons.

		03 April 2014",2014-04-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2763610,R v Hiroki [2014] NSWSC 365,"Judgment

1Aroha Hiroki, ("" the applicant""), is charged jointly with Jason Hiroki, ("" the co-accused""), that on 27 July 2011, they murdered Nicholas Katapodis at Mt St Thomas in New South Wales. 

2The applicant is charged in the alternative, with an offence against s 349(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, that she received, harboured, maintained and assisted the co-accused who had murdered Mr Katapodis.

3On 7 February 2014, each of the applicant and her co-accused, were arraigned and pleaded not guilty. 

4By Notice of Motion filed 3 March 2014, the applicant sought an order that she be tried separately from her co-accused. 

5The Crown opposes such an order. The solicitor for the co-accused informed the Court that he did not wish to make any submission with respect to the application. 

Overview of Crown Case

6An overview of the Crown case is to be obtained from the Crown Case Statement which was tendered on the application. 

7On the afternoon of 27 July 2011, the applicant and her co-accused were drinking at the Hellenic Club at Figtree, when they met a friend, Mr Wade Knowles. Knowles, who was drinking with them, later introduced Mr Katapodis to them. 

8The four remained drinking at the Club until late in the afternoon when, after visiting a number of other places, they arrived back at the premises that the applicant and her co-accused occupied in Mt St Thomas. 

9There they continued drinking, and the three males in the group consumed cannabis. At some stage in the course of the evening, Mr Katapodis went to the bathroom to use the toilet. He was extremely intoxicated, and commenced to urinate all over the bathroom floor and walls.

10The co-accused became aware of this, took hold of Mr Katapodis and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. 

11Mr Knowles assisted Mr Katapodis to his feet and took him back out into the dining room. Things apparently calmed down and the drinking continued. Mr Knowles left the premises at about 8.30pm, leaving Mr Katapodis in the presence of the applicant and her co-accused. This was the last occasion when Mr Katapodis was seen alive by anyone other than the applicant and her co-accused. 

12The applicant and her co-accused attended the Coniston Hotel at around 11.45pm that evening. Both had changed the clothes they had been wearing earlier that day prior to arriving back at her home. They spent about an hour at the Hotel, and returned home.

13On the following day, the co-accused told Mr Knowles both in a telephone call and in the course of conversation, that he had hit Mr Katapodis once after Mr Knowles had left the previous evening, and told Mr Katapodis to leave, which he did. On any view, this was a false account. 

14On 31 July 2011, the applicant and her co-accused attended the premises of a Mr Webster, who lived in the Dapto area, having caught the train together to get there. The co-accused asked Mr Webster if he could ""borrow a bit of turf"" so that he could bury a body. He told Mr Webster: 

""I killed a bloke. I went down to get another case of piss and when I got back home he was on top of my Missus. I grabbed him threw him off out of anger and he hit his head on a coffee table. I killed him when he hit his head.""

15There is an issue as to whether the applicant, although in the general vicinity of this conversation, heard and took part in the conversation. Mr Webster declined to allow the co-accused to bury a body on his property. 

16On 12 August 2011, Mr Katapodis was reported to the police as being missing. Having determined that the last place that Mr Katapodis had been seen alive was at the house occupied by the applicant and her co-accused, police executed a search warrant on that premises. 

17Police discovered that there was blood in three rooms of the premises, the lounge room, the dining room and the kitchen. Carpets, wall hangings and furniture items within those rooms had blood on them. The majority of the blood was found in the dining room. Some attempt had been made to clean the walls of the house. In one of the bedrooms, a lawn bowls bag was located, and blood was found on some of the lawn bowls and inside the bag. The majority of the swabs taken of the blood had the same DNA profile as Mr Katapodis. 

18A Crown expert has formed the conclusion that the bulk of the bloodstain patterns on the walls, ceiling and furniture items were produced from an area low to the ground.

19During the search, the police located what they believed was an attempt to dig a grave in a confined area underneath the house. The police formed the opinion at that time that the attempt to dig the grave had been unsuccessful. A palm print was found in the mud surrounding the gravesite which has been identified as that of the co-accused. 

20On 14 September 2011, the co-accused who had been on a business trip to Queensland was, upon his return from Queensland, arrested and charged. He exercised his right to silence. 

21On 20 February 2013, shortly before his trial was due to commence, a letter was received by the prosecuting authorities from the solicitor for the co-accused. The letter indicated that the co-accused was prepared to tell police where Mr Katapodis' body was buried, and that he also wished to be interviewed over the death. The letter provided an outline of the co-accused's version of events, which in substance contended that the applicant was solely responsible for the death of Mr Katapodis. 

22On 28 February 2013, the co-accused was interviewed in a formal recorded interview by police officers. At Question 49, in a rather long answer, he gave a version of events which included the following:

""But it was more Aroha saying 'get rid of [Mr Katapodis]'. I just, I said 'No, he's harmless, you know, he's done nothing wrong, he's only done that piss and that was it, he got a touch up for that'. And Wade left him there and we just sat there drinking and smoking all night, and when I smoke, I always do the old sneaky two, I went over to the lounge, but I said to Aroha and Nick, I said, 'just wake me up in an hour, cause I'm usually like that, at, you know, I'll have an hour's sleep, and then I'll get back up and start drinking with you again'. ... And in that hour or two, I'm not too sure how long it was, and then the biggest ... nightmare happened I suppose. Aroha's tugging at me, trying to get me up, and I finally woke up and I'm like, 'what's going on?' and I got off the couch and walked over, sort of, probably about two steps, and I seen Nick on the ground, I just said, '... what's happened here?, you know, what's ... going on? I was swearing hard at Aroha. She said he tried to come onto her. I said 'what do you ... mean? You know?' and she said 'He tried to come onto me, and I whacked him, and I looked at Nick. He was on the ground and he was out'. And I said, 'it must have been one hell of a ... whack', you know, and I was just gobsmacked. Straight away in my head I'm thinking I'm to blame. I think I throttled her and I just said, 'what the fuck have you done, what have you done' and I walked over to Nick, cause he looked out of conscious, and I put my hand over his mouth and nose and there was no air or nothing.""

23There was an answer to similar effect to a later question, when the co-accused told police that the applicant had said to him on the following day that she kept hitting Mr Katapodis on the head. 

24He then told police that he, with the applicant's assistance, wrapped Mr Katapodis' body in gladwrap, temporarily stored it in a shed on their property, and on the evening of 1 August 2011, had wheeled the Mr Katapodis' body, with the applicant's assistance, down to the front yard, dragged the body under the house, dug a grave and put the body in there.

25After the interview with the co-accused, the police re-excavated the gravesite which they had earlier identified, and found the body of Mr Katapodis. The forensic pathologist was unable to express any opinion as to a direct cause of death, largely because of the decomposition of the body of Mr Katapodis. However, the doctor noted a number of skull fractures which were potentially life-threatening injuries. He did not discover signs of any other potentially life-threatening injuries. 

26It is clear that each of the applicant and the co-accused have given different stories about what happened to different people. 

27I have referred earlier to the version of events given by the co-accused to the police on 28 February 2013. The sister of the co-accused visited the co-accused in jail in November 2011. As she was leaving, her brother told her that the applicant had committed the murder. When she spoke to the applicant, the applicant said that the co-accused had assaulted Mr Katapodis and that he then came ""... flying off the couch and started stabbing him ... three or four times"". No stab wounds were identified during the post-mortem examination. 

28On another occasion, the co-accused told his sister that the applicant had hit Mr Katapodis over the head with a bottle while he, the co-accused, was asleep. Somewhat later in time, another version of what happened emerged when a covert listening device captured a conversation between the applicant and the co-accused's sister, in which the applicant told her that Mr Katapodis had been assaulted not because he had come onto her, but because he had fouled the toilet. She said that she had not hit Mr Katapodis over the head with a bottle, but that the co-accused had used one of the lawn bowls to ""smash him over the head"". 

29On another occasion, the applicant's boyfriend, with whom she formed a relationship after the co-accused went to prison, has noted that the applicant had told him that the co-accused assaulted Mr Katapodis and beat him whilst in a rage. This seemingly had resulted in Mr Katapodis' death. 

30On three occasions in September 2011, the applicant gave interviews to the police. In the first interview, she gave a version of events which involved the co-accused assaulting Mr Katapodis, and then Mr Katapodis leaving the premises and not returning. In the second interview, she gave a similar version, but said that she had also assaulted Mr Katapodis. She maintained that Mr Katapodis had left the premises. Neither of these versions can be completely true, because Mr Katapodis died at the house occupied by the applicant and the co-accused.

31In the third interview, in September 2011, the applicant gave a broadly consistent version to her earlier accounts, but amplified it in some respects.

32On 27 March 2013, the day that the applicant was arrested and charged after the body of Mr Katapodis had been exhumed, when interviewed by the police, the applicant initially maintained a version of events consistent with that which she had provided to the police in September 2011. 

33During the course of the interview, it having been suspended for a period of time, the applicant gave the police a further version of events, indicating that she wanted to ""tell the truth"". She described the events which took place, in this part of the interview, as consisting of a serious assault by her co-accused on Mr Katapodis, consisting initially of a physical assault and then consisting of an occasion when the co-accused took a lawn bowl out of a bag and threw it at Mr Katapodis, striking him in the head. After he had fallen to the ground, the co-accused walked over to where he was lying and hit him on the head with a beer bottle.

34The applicant, according to this version, left the room at that point in time, and did not see what happened further. She accepted that she knew that the body had been buried by her co-accused, but denied knowing precisely where it was. 

35A number of phone calls between the applicant and her co-accused were intercepted lawfully whilst the co-accused was in jail, and the applicant at liberty. It is fair to say that an available inference from these telephone calls is that both the applicant and her co-accused were involved in the murder of Mr Katapodis.

The Application

36The applicant submits that she would suffer a positive injustice if she were tried jointly with the co-accused. She submits that there are two ways in which that positive injustice arises. 

37The first is that there will be evidence before a jury, namely, the electronically recorded interview of her co-accused of 28 February 2013, which, given that it is not admissible against her, nevertheless will put before the jury compelling evidence that she was involved in the murder, in a way which is not described by any other evidence. She submits that notwithstanding any directions which a trial Judge may give, the admissibility of this evidence would be highly prejudicial to her and result in a positive injustice to her. 

38The second basis upon which she submits that there should be a separate trial is that, having regard to all of the circumstances surrounding her relationship with her co-accused, the nature of his personality, and the nature of their relationship, she would feel physically and psychologically intimidated to such an extent that she would not be able to adequately follow the proceedings at her trial, give appropriate instructions to her counsel, or feel safe in giving evidence, should she choose so to do, at a trial.

Evidence

39I have earlier referred in some detail to the account of the events given by the co-accused about the applicant to the police on 28 February 2013. There is no need to describe any further evidence with respect to the first basis of injustice.

40It will, however, be necessary to identify and examine the evidence provided with respect to the second of the two grounds advanced by the applicant. 

41The applicant and the co-accused are first cousins. Prior to the arrest of the co-accused, they had been in a de facto relationship for some years.

42The applicant swore an affidavit on 3 March 2014. The Crown did not seek to challenge, by cross-examination, any matter in that affidavit. 

43According to the affidavit, the applicant and her co-accused commenced an intimate relationship in 2005 in New Zealand. The relationship was one which was characterised by physical violence perpetrated on the applicant by her co-accused. Prior to moving to Australia, the applicant's evidence is that the physical assaults upon her became a regular event in their relationship and she says that the only way she could stop her co-accused from assaulting her was to pretend to be unconscious.

44The applicant and the co-accused moved to Australia in 2006. The co-accused's consumption of alcohol increased in volume and, as a result, the violence against her also increased. Clearly, from the applicant's evidence, she was living in a relationship in which she was regularly being physically abused, up until the arrest of the co-accused in September 2011. Since his arrest and being in custody, there has been no occasion for the co-accused to perpetrate any physical violence on the applicant. 

45I accept the applicant's evidence that the relationship between her and the co-accused was one characterised by physical abuse perpetrated upon her by the co-accused. I accept that evidence for a number of reasons. 

46First, the Crown did not seek to challenge it. In the absence of any challenge to it, there would need to be a good reason as to why I would not accept it. 

47Secondly, the applicant's evidence is corroborated by a police Facts Sheet relating to an incident which occurred on 14 August 2009 in the Lake Illawarra area. That Facts Sheet records an incident between the applicant and the co-accused at the Dandaloo Hotel, which was witnessed by a number of people who were present on the premises. After the co-accused and the applicant left the premises, their dispute continued and the co-accused armed himself with a long timber-handled axe and followed the applicant towards an exit from the Hotel. As the co-accused approached the applicant, he held the axe above his head and said ""[g]et in the car now or I'll slice you up"". Although the vehicle drove off and the applicant was heard to be yelling, nothing more was seen. 

48The car was stopped by police, the axe was located in the back seat of the vehicle and, during a further search of the vehicle, a timber-handled fold knife was located. The co-accused was intoxicated. He adopted a very aggressive demeanour towards the arresting police. 

49The Facts Sheet then contains this paragraph:

""The victim was spoken to at length regarding the dispute, however refused to provide police with any details of the domestic dispute between her and the accused. The victim stated 'Me and my man argue like any normal couple. The problem is not between me and my man, it's between him and another bloke'. Police took out an interim apprehended violence order securing the protection of the applicant against the co-accused.""

50Thirdly, I have been provided with both the transcripts and recordings of two telephone conversations, which have occurred between the applicant and the co-accused. The first occurred on 14 December 2011. It is fair to say that the applicant and the co-accused engaged in a degree of heated conversation between each other in the course of that telephone conversation, suggesting, to the extent that any relationship existed, that it was a volatile one. The second conversation, which took place on 19 December 2012, was also a heated one. In it, the co-accused speaks in a very loud and forceful manner towards the applicant, and appears, to me, to lose his temper and significantly raise his voice in a manner which could be construed as threatening. 

51Finally, in an entirely unprompted way, the applicant described the abusive nature of the relationship in answer to a number of questions from police officers in the course of her various interviews with those police officers. Although much of what she said in those interviews was, to her knowledge, untrue, I see no reason to disbelieve her on the issue.

52The evidence also reveals that on 7 February 2014, when both the co-accused and the applicant were brought to this Court for the purpose of arraignment, they encountered one another in the cell complex at the Court. Apparently, the applicant did not expect the co-accused to be present. The co-accused verbally threatened the applicant whilst in the cell complex, and also threatened to cause harm to the applicant's boyfriend, Justin, who is a witness in the trial. 

53The applicant then records her reaction to that threat, which must be seen in the context of the long-term relationship between the applicant and the co-accused. She said:

"".... I then had to sit in the dock with only a single guard separating Jason and me. I noticed that Jason was even bigger than before he went to jail. He was also looking at me with a level of hatred beyond what he used to look at me when he used to bash me. I was shaking like a leaf in the court room. I could not concentrate on what was happening in court. 

...

16. I know that I would not be able to concentrate in court if Jason was in court with me. I also know that I would not be able to give evidence freely if Jason was in the same room as me. I know what he is capable of and after seeking the look in his eyes and his behaviour that day in court, I believe he is capable of an even greater level of violence towards me.""

54The fact that the applicant was verbally threatened by her co-accused is corroborated by her solicitor. 

55I accept that such verbal threats were delivered by the co-accused to the applicant on that occasion. 

Principles of Law

56As a general rule, and as a matter of good public policy, where it is alleged that a crime has been committed jointly by two or more individuals, those individuals should be prosecuted in a joint trial: R v Beavan (1952) 69 WN (NSW) 140; R v Assim [1966] 2 QB 249; Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41. 

57As Toohey J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) said in Webb at 89:

""I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prima facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others ... There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence, so far as it concerns each accused ... In the end the critical question before an appellate court in these circumstances is whether, by reason of the joint trial, there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice or, put in another way, whether improper prejudice has been created against an accused.""

58The exception to the prima facie rule of joint trials is if it is established that there is a positive injustice caused to an accused by requiring him or her to participate in a joint trial, then a separate trial should be ordered: R v Middis NSWSC, unreported, 27 March 1991; R v Baartman NSWCCA, unreported, 6 October 1994; R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66.

59In Fernando at [210], the Court (Newman, Studdert and James JJ) approved the statement of Hunt J in Middis, stating that:

""The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him a joint trial.""

60The reported cases have recognised that one way in which a positive injustice can be shown is where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than, and different from, that admissible against another accused who is to be jointly tried, and where that evidence contains material highly prejudicial to that applicant, although not admissible against him or her. If the consequence of the admission of such evidence is that a weaker Crown case against an applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, that may be a sufficient ground for a separate trial: see Middis; Baartman; Fernando at [210].

61More recently, it has been said that the question of comparison of relative weaknesses and strengths of the cases against each accused, should not be regarded as an overly relevant factor: see R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 at [40]; R v Lu; R v Pham [2007] NSWSC 1141.

62However, a number of decisions suggest that where the defence cases to be conducted before the jury involve each accused seeking to blame the other accused, then that is a factor which tends in favour of the holding of a joint trial. The remarks of Toohey J, to which I have earlier referred, support such a proposition. 

63The remarks of Herron J (as the Chief Justice then was) in Beavan, have also been consistently approved. At 142-143, his Honour said:

""If separate trials were had, very often only one half of the picture could be presented to the jury. In order to do complete justice, juries are entitled to see and hear all those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose, and it is neither a rule of law nor of practice that where an essential part of one accused's defence amounts to an attack on a co-accused there must be separate trials. Cases have occurred, and will no doubt continue to occur, in which one accused says that he or she was persuaded by the superior intellect of the other accused to take some part in the enterprise, or that he or she was intimidated by the relationship or threats of that other. It is essential to the proper appreciation of such cases that the jury should see and hear all parties.""

64More recently, in Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 79 ALJR 662, the High Court of Australia was considering a question of whether there had been a miscarriage of justice arising from a failure to order separate trials in circumstances where an infant was murdered, and that death could only have been caused by one or other, or perhaps both, of two accused who were tried jointly. At [58], Callinan and Heydon JJ said:

""The events leading up to the murder and dismemberment of the infant, and the guilt or innocence of the appellant and the co-accused, were closely interconnected. Their relationship, their similar motives, their almost equal opportunity to commit the crimes, and their capacity, either separately or jointly to commit them, all argued very strongly in favour of a joint trial. There were no special or other features of the case requiring that they be tried separately. That one might seek to incriminate the other, as each accused here did, could provide no justification for a direction that the appellant and his co-accused be tried separately: R v Palmer [1969] 2 NSWR 13. A joint trial of the appellant and the co-accused served to give the jury the means of obtaining a conspectus of the respective roles of each of them in the crimes with which they were charged.""

65Most recently in Ross v R [2012] NSWCCA 207, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered the question of separate trials. Allsop P (with whom Hidden and Davies JJ agreed) said with respect to joint or separate trials, this:

""24. The appellant and the mother were jointly charged with a number of the offences. In the ordinary course one would not expect them to be tried separately: R v Demirok [1976] VR 244 at 254; Demirok v R [1977] HCA 21; 137 CLR 20; and see generally R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [199]-[212]. The danger that may exist is by the admission of evidence against one only of the accused. This risk is to be obviated by express and careful directions as to the use of evidence: R v Harbach (1973) 6 SASR 427 at 433. There is a public interest in the avoidance of the risk of inconsistent verdicts, of inconvenience to witnesses, and in ensuring finality is reached as expeditiously as possible by having one trial. The interests of justice in this respect are not limited to those of the accused: Demirok; Webb and Hay v R [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 at 89.

25 In R v Baartman (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Powell JA and Smart J, 6 October 1994, unreported), the Chief Justice accepted as stating the relevant principles what Hunt J had said in R v Middis (Supreme Court of NSW, 27 March 1991, unreported):

'1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and
2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and
3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,
a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.'

26 There is a balance to be struck between the public interest and any prejudice to the accused, relevant to which assessment is whether there is positive injustice to the accused: R v Dellapatrona (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 133.""

66It is important to observe what was said in R v Dellapatrona (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 133:

""There remains a balance to be struck between the public interest and the efficient dispatch of criminal trials and any prejudice which may be caused to the accused. It is desirable to have all those charged in relation to a particular crime tried at the same time unless positive injustice would thereby be caused."" (emphasis in original)

67It is also necessary to note that it is the case that the common law proceeds upon the assumption that juries obey instructions and directions from trial Judges. In Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414, McHugh J said at [31]:

""The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and they obey the trial judge's directions. ... Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.""

68On the other hand, as Gleeson CJ and Gummow J said in the same case, at [13]:

The system of criminal justice, as administered by appellate courts, requires the assumption that, as a general rule, juries understand, and follow, the directions they are given by trial judges. It does not involve the assumption their decision making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice.""

Discernment

The Evidentiary Basis for Separate Trial

69It is clear that if a joint trial is held, the evidence to be tendered by the Crown would include the electronically recorded interview of the co-accused given on 28 February 2013, in which he tells the investigating police that the applicant is entirely responsible for the fatal assault on Mr Katapodis, and that he played no role in that fatal assault. 

70The Crown Prosecutor, who appeared before me, made it plain that whilst the Crown had an obligation to put that material before the jury because it was exculpatory of the co-accused, the Crown did not accept the truth of what the co-accused had said in giving that version to the police. In fact, the Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that the Crown would be putting to the jury that they should not accept that version of the events. 

71It is equally clear that counsel for the applicant would be putting to the jury that they ought not accept such an account. 

72Accordingly, insofar as the evidence sought to be tendered by the Crown is concerned, with respect to the relevant part of this electronically recorded interview, the jury would be confronted with submissions that the evidence ought not be believed, consistently by the Crown and the applicant's counsel. As well, the trial Judge would be required to, and it must be assumed would, give a direction in clear terms setting out what evidence was admissible against each accused, and what evidence was not admissible against each accused. Clearly, the electronically recorded interview of the co-accused is not admissible against the applicant, and the jury would be so directed. 

73In those circumstances, I would not be satisfied that a joint trial, which would include that evidence, would result in a positive injustice to the applicant. 

74There is a reasonable case against the applicant on the basis of other evidence. It is clear that the applicant, and the co-accused, were left alone in the house with the deceased, Mr Katapodis. They were the last people to see him alive. At the very least, the applicant, in her interviews with investigating police, finally accepts that she was present at a time when Mr Katapodis was killed. She participated to some extent in an assault upon him, which was part of a continuous series of events, resulting in the death of Mr Katapodis. As well at least, she was aware that the co-accused buried the deceased's body somewhere on the property in which they both lived. She participated in cleaning up some of the blood splatter from parts of the walls and furniture. She accompanied the co-accused to the property of Mr Webster when he was requested to provide land where the body could be buried. And, as well, she has given a number of admittedly false accounts to the police officers with respect to what occurred. 

75Importantly, the contents of telephone conversations which have been recorded, and other conversations in which she has participated, are put forward by the Crown as evidence of statements contrary to her interest from which the inference ought be drawn that she was involved in the murder of Mr Katapodis. 

76In light of all of this material, I am not satisfied that the admission into evidence of that electronically recorded interview against the co-accused will result in a positive injustice to the applicant. 

77I would not be prepared to uphold the applicant's Motion on this ground.

Applicant's Fear of the Co-Accused as a Basis for a Separate Trial

78I have already noted that I accept the applicant's evidence that she is fearful of the co-accused. That fear initially derived from the physical abuse which occurred in the course of their relationship and cohabitation. The resumption of the relationship is impossible before the commencement, and for the duration of, a trial. That is because both the applicant and the co-accused are in custody, and are kept in separate Correctional Centres. Any contact between them at pre-trial hearings or during the trial will be in highly structured environments. It will be a matter for the Correctional Service to ensure the proper physical safety of the applicant and co-accused, both in a courtroom and travelling to and from the Court, and whilst in the Court complex. 

79There is no basis, having regard to a fear of physical harm in the preparation for, or else during the trial, to order a separate trial.

80Different considerations, however, apply to the question of the applicant's state of mind. The applicant has deposed that her state of mind is such that she fears that she will be unable to follow the trial and adequately give instructions to her counsel, and if she chooses so to do, to give evidence. She has that state of mind because of the past physical conduct of her co-accused towards her, and a fear that he will cause similar physical conduct to her in the future, either directly or indirectly. Put differently, she says that she is intimidated by the presence of her co-accused, such that any trial, if held jointly, would be unfair

81The Crown does not submit that I should find that such fears are irrational, but the Crown does submit that, in all of the circumstances of these proceedings, and having regard to the principles to which reference has been made earlier, the applicant's fears are insufficient to bring about any positive injustice to her. 

82On the other hand, the applicant's counsel submits, in writing, the following:

""In order to raise a reasonable doubt and address adverse inferences that might otherwise be available on the evidence, the applicant may make a decision to waive her right to silence and enter the witness box in her trial. The applicant's affidavit of 3 March 2014 ..., strongly suggests that the applicant's defence could be severely compromised, resulting in a positive injustice, if she cannot give her evidence freely and without fear. Furthermore, an unjustifiable unfairness would occur if the applicant were unable to properly follow proceedings as a result of the intimidating presence of the co-accused. Given the history of violence and threats from the co-accused to the applicant, noting that the applicant has given a police interview implicating the co-accused, it is unsurprising that her current sense of fear and trepidation has been heightened despite their respective incarcerations.""

83Thus, it is submitted by the applicant that a joint trial would compromise her ability to present a reasoned defence at her trial. 

84The Court is obliged, in considering the applicant's submissions, to have regard to, and to take into account, the public interest in the administration of justice in avoiding, where possible, the cost, expense and inconvenience of replicating, or substantially replicating, a second trial. There is also a public interest, as the authorities show, in putting two applicants before the same jury where they each seek to blame each other for the crime with which they are both charged.

85I do not leave out of this consideration the fact that the applicant, but not her co-accused, is facing alternative charges, one of murder and the other of being an accessory after the fact of murder. However, in my view, the substance of the defences of each of the applicant and the co-accused is that they were not responsible for the death of Mr Katapodis, and that they seek to implicate each other.

86The public interest in having these respective contentions heard before the same jury, together with the Crown's case against both of the accused at the same time, is a significant one. 

87It is a matter for the applicant to persuade me that she will suffer a positive injustice. However, I am not so persuaded. 

88First, a good deal of the preparation for the trial will be done prior to the trial commencing. It will done by the applicant in consultation with her lawyers, providing them with such instructions as is appropriate. There is no suggestion that this process would in any way be adversely affected in the context of a joint trial as opposed to the context of a separate trial.

89Secondly, whether the applicant faces a joint or separate trial, the fact that her defence is that she was not responsible for the murder, but that her co-accused is responsible, is now well known. Nothing new will come of that defence, whether the trial be a joint one or a separate one. If she fears revenge being taken upon her by her co-accused either directly or indirectly, the joint trial or a separate trial will not affect this concern. 

90Thirdly, in the event that for any reason the applicant is unable to give instructions to her lawyers during the course of the trial, it would be open to those lawyers to seek a short adjournment for the purpose of obtaining instructions from the applicant free from the presence of the co-accused, and free from any intimidation from the co-accused. In this way, proper instructions for the conduct of her defence can be given. 

91Fourthly, whether the applicant chooses to give evidence or not is presently unknown. It is idle for this Court to speculate whether that may be so. If she does choose to give evidence, she can always seek to give evidence via audio-visual link, and seek from the trial Judge a direction that the jury should not form any adverse view of her by reason of that fact. If she does give evidence by audio-visual link, to the extent that such a manner of giving evidence may be disadvantageous, it is my judgment that it is much more like to be disadvantageous to her co-accused, than to the applicant. 

92Fifthly, I see no sufficient reason for transferring the consequences of the history of the applicant's violent relationship with her co-accused into the staid surroundings of a courtroom where the applicant and co-accused are separately incarcerated, and where proper arrangements can be made to ensure that the applicant would be physically safe. However, that is, in effect, what the applicant seeks to do.

93Even if I was persuaded, and I am not, that the applicant is disadvantaged or prejudiced by a joint trial, that disadvantage or prejudice needs to be weighed against the public interest in having a joint trial where each accused seeks to blame each other for the crime. I need also to weigh in the balance the public interest in not incurring the expense and inconvenience of two trials where much of the evidence and the witnesses will be common.

94In undertaking this balancing exercise, I am satisfied that the public interest in having, as Herron J said in Beavan, one ""... jury to see and hear all parties"", significantly outweighs, in the circumstances of this case, any prejudice or disadvantage to the applicant. In so finding, I leave out of consideration the public interest in avoiding expense and inconvenience.

95For those reasons, I am not satisfied in all of the circumstances that the applicant has discharged the burden which falls upon her to persuade me that she will suffer a positive injustice by reason of a joint trial, and that separate trials should be ordered.

96The Motion must be dismissed.

Orders

97I make the following order:

(1)Motion dated 3 March 2014 for a separate trial is dismissed.

		08 February 2016",2014-04-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763621,Application by MLP pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 390,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1MLP (""the applicant"") seeks, pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act""), an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon him following his conviction of an offence pursuant to s. 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, namely that between 1 February 2003 and 1 July 2003, near Forster in the State of New South Wales, he had sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years.
2The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In making his application, the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
3The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].  
THE APPLICANT'S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE4The applicant stood trial before Judge Garling and a jury in the District Court.  The offence of which he was found guilty carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment is prescribed.
5Following his conviction, the applicant was sentenced by Judge Garling to imprisonment for a total of 16 years, made up of a non-parole period of 12 years and an additional term of 4 years.  Both the non-parole period and the additional term were expressed to date from 12 May 2005.  The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 11 May 2017.  
6When sentencing the applicant, and having made reference to the provisions of s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") his Honour said (at ROS 8):
""The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole are those referred to in s. 21A.  If the court is to do that they have to make a record. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered these matters in the decision of R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR at 168. Particularly, at paras 41 and onwards where the court set out the purpose of sentencing and those aggravating and mitigating factors. At para 117 the court said:
""In order to give the division (that is this refers to s 54B) practical utility it seems to us, in the light of the foregoing analysis, that a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question: 'Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?'  That question will be answered by considering the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind. The circumstances of aggravation and mitigation which are present in the subject case and which may apply to a particular offender as listed in s. 21A(2) and (3) and as incorporated by the general provisions of s. 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s. 21A(1). Depending upon the considerations referred to in the first of these paragraphs it may become immediately apparent that the case is not one for which the standard non-parole period.."" 
7His Honour then said (at ROS 9):
""Therefore I am required to undertake that sentencing exercise in this case"".
8His Honour's reference to ""that sentencing exercise"" can only be construed as a reference to the approach set out in Way.  
9Following his sentence, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.   In a judgment delivered on 6 September 2006 (see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271) the Court:
(i)granted leave to appeal; 
(ii)allowed the appeal;
(iii)confirmed the sentence of 16 years imprisonment; and
(iv)reduced the non-parole period to one of 11 years commencing on 12 May 2005 and expiring on 11 May 2016.
10Kirby J (with whom Grove J and Hislop J agreed) made reference to the decision in Way (at [31]) and posed the question (at [32]):
""... are there other reasons in the matters identified in s21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non parole period?""

11His Honour concluded (at [39]) that the approach taken by the sentencing judge did not conform with the approach set out in Way (supra) and that as a consequence, the sentencing judge was in error.  However, his Honour then said (at [55]):
""The personal circumstances of the applicant furnish, in my view, a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period"".
12In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that Way was wrongly decided and that it was an error to characterise s. 54B(2) of the Sentencing Act as being framed in mandatory terms, requiring the court to take the standard non-parole period as the starting point for an offence assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The Court concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period and held that the correct approach was to identify all the factors relevant to sentence (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence, given all those factors.  
13Further, (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle range of objective seriousness and, in the event that it does, by inquiring as to whether there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.   It was the second of those issues which Kirby J addressed in the passage at [55] (set out in [10] above).
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES14It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that notwithstanding that the applicant's appeal was successful, the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error as a consequence of the adoption of a two stage approach to sentencing.  
15It was firstly submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to Muldrock - type error.  However as Johnson J pointed out in Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17] such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of NSW  [2013] NSWCA 383.
16Counsel for the Attorney-General specifically conceded that the judgment of Kirby J (at [55]) disclosed a Muldrock error because it indicated the adoption, by his Honour, of an impermissible two-stage approach to sentencing.  However counsel submitted that in light of the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal had imposed the same overall sentence, no sense of disquiet arose despite the obvious error.
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION17The concession made on behalf of the Attorney-General is, in my view, an appropriate one.  It is evident that Kirby J engaged in a two stage process of sentencing.   
18In my view, it is not to the point that the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed the overall sentence which had been imposed upon the applicant at first instance.  The more important consideration is that the Court did so by adopting an approach which, in light of the decision in Muldrock, discloses error.  The existence of that error gives rise, in my view, to a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, the existence of which warrants a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
ORDERS19For the foregoing reasons I make the following orders:
(i)The application is granted;
(ii)The matter is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

		10 April 2014",2014-04-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763624,Sheen v R [2014] NSWCCA 42,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  By an indictment dated 9 May 2011 the applicant was charged with the attempted kidnapping of Mr Glen Mara (s 86(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and the specially aggravated kidnapping of Ms Shari Huggett (s 86(3)) of the Crimes Act).  When the matter came before the District Court, the Crown provided the court with a certificate pursuant to s 166(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) stating that, in relation to the first count, the applicant had been charged with ""the back up offence"" of common assault of Mr Mara (s 61 Crimes Act).  This assault was part of the incident that gave rise to the attempted kidnapping charge.
2Following plea negotiations, the applicant pleaded guilty on an amended indictment to the offences of common assault of Mr Mara and specially aggravated kidnapping of Ms Huggett.  The common assault charge thus replaced the attempted kidnapping charge.
3On 20 January 2012 Freeman ADCJ sentenced the applicant in relation to the common assault and specially aggravated kidnapping counts charged in the amended indictment.  As well, his Honour sentenced the applicant for the offence of common assault contained in the back up charge.  The sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of three months (commencing 22 January 2010 and expiring 21 April 2010) that his Honour imposed was the same as that for the common assault charge in the amended indictment.  In relation to the offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment for seven years and two months commencing on 22 April 2010, with a non-parole period of five years and two months.  The overall sentence was therefore imprisonment for seven years and five months.  
CONVICTION APPEAL
4Mr Sheen appeals against his conviction on the back up charge.  As the Crown accepts, his conviction on that charge was a mistake as the charge was intended as a back up to the charge of attempted kidnapping in the original indictment.  When, by amendment of the indictment, that charge was replaced by the charge of common assault, the back up charge became otiose, because it duplicated it, and should have been dismissed.  
5This conclusion is consistent with s 167(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides for the charge of the back up offence to be dismissed if the accused (whether after a plea of guilty or trial) is found guilty of the primary offence.  In this case, the charge of the primary offence was replaced by a charge identical to the back up offence.  It is clear that Mr Sheen should not have been convicted of both this offence and the identical back up offence. 
SENTENCE APPEAL
6The applicant also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence.  The single ground upon which he relies is that the sentencing judge erred ""in failing properly to assess the role of the applicant in the offences"".  I turn then to address this ground.
The factual circumstances
7The following description of the factual circumstances is taken verbatim from the applicant's amended submissions.  The Crown accepted that the summary, which is of the contents of an Agreed Statement of Facts, is accurate.
(1) Glen Mara (the victim of the common assault offence) owed the applicant $200.  Mara had been uncontactable for several weeks as his phone was broken. On 13 January 2010, when Mara's phone was fixed, the applicant called him.  The applicant said he wanted to be paid that day or he would 'get' Mara. They met later that day but the debt was not paid.
(2) On 14 January 2010, Mara spoke to the applicant on the phone.  [The applicant] told [Mara] to hurry up and meet him at a service station in Loftus.  At about 11.25pm, Mara's girlfriend Shari Huggett (the victim of the offence of specially aggravated detain for advantage) drove him to Loftus.  Mara asked her to park behind a fire station and walked through a park to the service station.
(3) Mara felt uneasy when he saw the applicant standing near a Commodore with some men inside [these being Carroll, Wilken and Whiteman].  The applicant approached Mara and said, ""Come in the car"".  Mara replied, ""No, let's go for a walk"".  The applicant said, ""Just get in the fuckin' car"".  Carroll yelled out from the car, ""Get in the fuckin' car"".  The applicant swung a punch at Mara but missed (the offence of common assault).
(4) Wilken jumped out of the car and chased Mara, who ran down the road and hid in a driveway.  Wilken was carrying something (in evidence he said it was a beer bottle).  Wilken called Mara to come out.  Mara thought he was going to be shot and sent a text message to Huggett warning her to go home.
(5) Huggett drove around the block and saw the Commodore.  Whiteman drove the Commodore behind Huggett with the car's headlights on high beam.  Huggett attempted to drive into the service station but Whiteman stopped the car diagonally across the road blocking traffic.  [Carroll, Wilken and the applicant] jumped out of the car and ran towards Huggett's car.
(6) Huggett described a ""larger guy"" (Carroll), who appeared to be in charge.  She saw another male on the passenger side of her car, pointing towards her (the applicant), and a third male (Wilken).  The three offenders approached the car and one of them opened the driver's door.  Huggett's phone fell on the road.  An offender grabbed it.  
(7) Carroll reached across Huggett's face and grabbed her hair.  He pulled her hair so that her face was close to his and yelled, ""Where's Glen?""  Huggett said she did not know.  Carroll accused her of lying and repeatedly hit her in the face.  He said, ""You're gonna take me to him now"".  Carroll pulled Huggett down out of view when [a] witness saw what was happening.  The applicant and Wilken returned to the Commodore.
(8) Carroll climbed into the passenger's seat of Huggett's car and continued to question her about Mara's whereabouts.  Huggett was extremely scared and suggested she show him where Mara had been staying at his brother's house in Loftus.  Huggett was forced to drive with Carroll in the passenger seat.  Wilken, Whiteman and the applicant followed in the Commodore.
(9) Huggett stopped the car and pointed out Mara's brother's house.  Carroll became angry when she used the indicator.  Carroll told her to turn off the headlights and take her foot off the brake.  He demanded she give him the keys and he got out of the car, causing the cabin light to turn on.  Carroll returned and asked Huggett if she was an ""idiot"" and told her to pull the door shut.
(10) The Commodore parked behind Huggett.  The three offenders returned from the direction of the house.  Carroll climbed back into the passenger seat of Huggett's car.  Wilken and the applicant climbed into the rear.  Wilken sat behind Huggett and the applicant behind Carroll.  Whiteman was in the Commodore.
(11) One of the offenders found one of Huggett's dresses in the rear and pulled a piece of it around her neck jamming her head up and forcing her back in her seat.  Wilken tried to choke Huggett using the fabric.  She hooked her fingers over the material and pulled it outwards so she could breathe.
(12) Carroll said, ""You are going to find Glen and help us get him otherwise this is what's gonna happen to you"".  Huggett said she had only known Mara a couple of weeks.  Wilken said she was saying too much. Carroll said ""We are going to kill you and bury you under concrete in a farm down in Goulburn"" and, ""Shut up and listen, if you don't shut up and listen I'm going to disfigure your face, I'll cut you"".  
(13) Wilken continued to pull the fabric around Huggett's throat, choking her for a minute or two.  Carroll told the applicant to get out and drive Huggett's car.  The applicant got into the driver's seat.  Huggett was pulled between the front seats and into the rear by the material around her throat.  Wilken said, ""Get your head down"".  He pulled Huggett's jacket over her head and released the fabric around her neck.  He held her head down with the jacket over it so she could not see.  The offenders drove around the Loftus area then parked near some shops.  
(14) Carroll said, ""You're going to get out of this fine if you organise to meet Glen"".  Huggett agreed to help.  They met up with the Commodore and Huggett was given her phone.  Carroll told Huggett to tell Mara they had caught and scared her but were now gone and she needed him.  She called Mara but he did not answer.  Carroll dictated a message to Huggett.  They waited for Mara to reply.
(15) Carroll and the applicant got out of the car.  Someone said, ""Make sure you wipe the dash down"".  Wilken remained in the car with Huggett still beneath the jacket.  He said, ""You'll get out of this okay if you help us.  I'm the nicest one out of the group"".  Huggett started to cry and he told her it would be okay.  Carroll and the applicant returned.  Carroll said, ""You're fucked, you're fucked"", and Wilken fell silent.  Carroll said, ""Have you got hold of him yet?""  Wilken said, ""No she's just sent him a message"".  Carroll said, ""Well call him again now"".
(16) Huggett called Mara again, Mara had found that Huggett had left the fire station and was walking to find a pay phone when he received the call.  Huggett told him she would collect him and Mara said he was at a swimming pool.  Huggett told the offenders where Mara would be.  Carroll told her what to do when they arrived.  Huggett agreed to cooperate.  She said Mara was expecting her and they let her drive.
(17) One of the offenders saw police patrolling the area and all went quiet.  Huggett waited a while then lifted the jacket.  She saw the offenders walking away.  Wilken turned and pointed at her and told her to go straight to the pool.  Huggett drove off and stopped when she saw a police car.  The police officers were speaking with Whiteman in the Commodore at the time, but they let Whiteman go.
(18) Huggett approached police, appearing hysterical and terrified.  She was sweating and seemed to have been crying.  She was shaking and could not stand still.  She told police, ""They are going to kill me.  They are after me"".  She said the offenders had seen her driver's licence and knew where she lived.
(19) Huggett sustained a swollen and bruised upper lip with a scratch above it and a split and tender lower lip.  She had a scratch above her breast, bruising and soreness to her back and left arm, bruising beneath her chin and some small bruises to her right arm.  Her neck was bruised and red.  Her neck and jaw were sore.
The sentencing judgment
8By his judgment of 20 January 2012, Freeman ADCJ sentenced three of the individuals, namely Carroll, Wilken and the applicant, who were involved in the events which I have described above.  They each pleaded guilty to charges of common assault and specially aggravated kidnapping in terms corresponding to those contained in the Amended Indictment relating to the applicant.  Having found that Ms Huggett had been given cause by the offenders to fear for her life, his Honour concluded:
""In this case I do not find, to the requisite standard, that there was much planning.  It seems to me more likely that the presence of the victim, Shari Huggett, could not have been foreseen and the way in which she was dealt with strikes me as improvised rather than organised"" (pp 10 - 11).
9His Honour then said the following concerning the roles of the three offenders:
""It seems to me that the roles played by each of the offenders does not provide much material to differentiate between them.  Sheen must have been the instigator, because he was the one attempting to collect money from Mara.  Carroll appears to have taken the lead in terms of directing their activities and being the first to assault Huggett.  Wilken was the one who strangled her and kept her pressed down with her head covered and none is entitled to be regarded as significantly less culpable than his fellows"" (p 11).
The applicant's submissions
10The applicant submitted that the fact that he was attempting to recover money from Mara did not demonstrate that he ""instigated"" the offence against Ms Huggett, as the sentencing judge held.  He submitted that this finding was not open on the evidence.
11He further submitted that the offence concerning Ms Huggett was ""of a markedly different nature and gravity"" to that concerning Mr Mara and was predominantly carried out by the applicant's co-offenders.  He said that his physical participation was limited to driving the victim's vehicle at Carroll's direction.
12He contended that the sentencing judge erred in treating the three offenders as equally culpable and that his Honour should have found that he was significantly less culpable than the others, resulting in the imposition of a substantially lower sentence.  He submitted that as a result of the identity of the sentences imposed he had a justifiable sense of grievance (Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 623). 
Resolution of the application for leave to appeal
13In sentencing participants in a joint criminal enterprise it is undoubtedly necessary to determine the level of culpability for which each is to be sentenced (R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at [161] - [162]).  Whilst such participants are each liable for the acts committed in the carrying out of the enterprise, their individual roles, or other circumstances, may indicate that their sentences should differ.  The participant in a joint criminal enterprise who actually performed the criminal act is not necessarily the most culpable of the participants (R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [29]; R v JW at [162]).
14The determination of a participant's role is part of the process of the court determining the objective seriousness of the offence committed by the accused, as distinct from those offences committed by his or her co-offenders.  Accordingly, the following statement of principle from Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 is applicable to the applicant's attempt to have this Court review the sentencing judge's characterisation of his role in the criminal enterprise:  
""46 The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.""
See also at [37], Mercael v R [2010] NSWCCA 36 at [85] and Michael v R [2014] NSWCCA 2 at [160].
15In the present case, the sentencing judge recognised that the roles of the applicant, Carroll and Wilken in the enterprise were different but concluded that nevertheless their culpability was the same.  Thus, his Honour treated the applicant's role as ""the instigator"" as bringing the level of his criminality to that of Carroll, who appeared to direct activities, and of Wilken, who engaged directly in physical violence in relation to Ms Huggett.
16In my view it was open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the applicant was the instigator of the criminal enterprise.  It was he who was owed $200 by Mara and pressed forcefully for repayment.  When that did not occur, the applicant pressed Mara to meet him and, importantly, the applicant arrived for the meeting, not alone, but with Carroll, Wilken and Whiteman in the car and clearly galvanised to assist the applicant, with aggression or threats of aggression, to obtain his money.  The applicant demanded that Mara get in the car, resorting to violence when he did not.  The punch that the applicant threw (which missed) constituted the offence of common assault of which he was convicted.  The applicant clearly had a significant role in inciting at least Carroll and Wilken to aggression and then violence, Carroll repeating the applicant's demand to Mara to ""get in the fuckin' car"".  By having his co-offenders present to assist him to recover his money and by charging the atmosphere with aggression and violence, the applicant instigated the confrontation with Mr Mara.
17The three offenders did not redirect themselves to another objective as events unfolded.  On the contrary, the recovery of the applicant's money by the use of aggression and violence remained the objective of the offenders throughout, as evidenced by their continued efforts to have Ms Huggett lead them to Mr Mara.  The conduct in relation to Ms Huggett did not assume a life of its own.  That conduct was engaged in simply as a means to the end of recovering the applicant's money.  The applicant was thus fairly to be regarded as the instigator of that conduct, as well as the confrontation with Mr Mara.
18As the Crown pointed out, the applicant's ground of appeal was concerned solely with the sentencing judge's characterisation of his role in the criminal enterprise and did not, at least in terms, rely upon the parity principle by asserting that the imposition of the same sentences on the applicant and his co-offenders gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance (Lowe v The Queen at 623).  Nevertheless, as I have noted, the applicant's written submissions did make such an assertion.
19It is sufficient to say in response that the rejection of the challenge to his Honour's characterisation of the applicant's role is inconsistent with the applicant having any justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the relative sentences of himself and his co-offenders.  
ORDERS
20An extension of time is required for the conviction appeal.  It is not opposed and should be granted.
21Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
(1)The time for appeal in relation to Mr Sheen's conviction on the s 166 Certificate common assault charge is extended.
(2)The appeal made pursuant to that grant of leave is allowed and that conviction quashed.
(3)The application for leave to appeal against sentence is allowed but the appeal is dismissed.
22GARLING J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA and with his reasons.
23I desire to add some additional remarks with respect to the sentence imposed on the applicant following his plea of guilty to the offence against s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, of specially aggravated kidnapping.
24The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years.  The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 2 months, of which 5 years and 2 months was the non-parole period.
25As the facts agreed upon disclose, the applicant, together with three other men, embarked upon the task of collecting a very small debt of $200 owed to the applicant by Mr Mara.  There is no doubt that the applicant was prepared to use violence, or at least the threat of it, to obtain the money.
26Mr Mara escaped from the applicant and his fellow debt collectors.  Whilst trying to avoid detection Mr Mara sought help from his girlfriend of two weeks, Ms Huggett, to collect him and drive him away.  Whilst she was trying to help Mr Mara, the applicant and two of his fellow assailants forcefully entered her car, and the offence was committed.
27Ms Huggett was physically assaulted by at least one of the men, threatened and made to drive her car as directed by of one or other of the applicant and his fellow assailants as they searched for Mr Mara.  In the course of what must have been a most frightening and thoroughly unpleasant experience, Ms Huggett was threatened with being killed, and with being facially disfigured.
28She was only saved from the offenders by the attendance, in the vicinity, of a police patrol car.  When she spoke to the police officers, she appeared to them to be terrified and was hysterical.  She had obvious physical injuries.
29The plea of guilty by the applicant was a late one, entitling him to only a modest discount which the sentencing Judge allowed.
30In light of the very serous nature of the criminal conduct involved in this offence, I am quite unable to see that any criticism can be properly made of the sentence imposed by the Court below.  The applicant set in train all of the events which occurred that evening, and he bears the responsibility for what occurred.
31There is no error on the part of the sentencing Judge, and in my view, in the proper exercise of the discretion residing in him, had a longer sentence been imposed, that would have been entirely justified.
32RS HULME AJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA and with his Honour's reasons.  I agree also with the additional remarks of Garling J.

2763643,"LEUNG, Simon Yuk v R [2014] NSWCCA 44","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.

2ADAMS J: I agree with Hall J.

3HALL J: The applicant by way of Notice dated 28 November 2013, seeks leave to appeal against a total sentence of 28 months with an effective non-parole period of 18 months imposed following pleas of guilty to two counts, namely: 

(i) A count of reckless wounding contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900; and

(ii) A count of possess a prohibited weapon contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998.

4A further offence of common assault was taken into account on a Form 1 when the applicant was sentenced for the reckless wounding offence.

5The applicant entered the guilty pleas on 23 April 2013. On 26 July 2013 the District Court imposed the following sentences:

(a) In respect of the offence contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1988, a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months to commence on 26 July 2013 and to conclude on 25 April 2014.

(b) In respect of the offence of reckless wounding contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900, a sentence comprising a non-parole period of 15 months to date from 26 October 2013 and to conclude on 25 January 2015. A balance of term of 10 months was imposed to commence from 26 January 2015 and to conclude on 25 November 2015.

6An offence contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 has a maximum penalty of 7 years, with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.

7An offence contrary to s 7 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 has a maximum penalty of 14 years, with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.

Grounds of Appeal

8Five grounds of appeal were relied on by the applicant. They are in the following terms:

""1. The sentencing Judge erred by failing to comply with the provisions in ss 45(1) and 45(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

2. (i) The sentence in relation to the prohibited weapon offence is manifestly excessive.

(ii) The sentencing Judge failed to consider the extent to which the criminality in the prohibited weapon offence was encompassed or subsumed by the facts of the s 35 offence and failed to give effect to the principles articulated in the case of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.

(iii) The sentencing Judge erred by accumulating the sentences imposed on the two counts.

3. The sentencing Judge erred in his approach to the Applicant's psychiatric condition.

4. The sentencing Judge failed to give effect to his stated intention to provide the Applicant with a 25% discount for his plea.

5. The sentencing Judge erred in concluding that the only appropriate sentence was one of full time custody.""

Facts

9A statement of Agreed Facts dated 28 June 2013 was tendered at the sentencing hearing, which was in the following terms:

""1. On Monday 26 November 2012, Yong Zong LU (""the victim"") a tourist bus driver had parked his bus registration number XXXXXX (NSW) along Reiby Place, Sydney NSW.

2. At approximately 5.09 pm the accused, Simon Yuk LEUNG (""LEUNG""), the driver of a grey Tiguan, registration number XXXXXX (NSW) parked his vehicle directly in front of victim's bus in a non-stopping zone.

3. When the victim later attempted to move his bus, he was unable to do so due to there being insufficient room. LEUNG was parked in front of his bus and there was another bus parked closely behind the victim. The victim exited his bus and made gestures to LEUNG to move his car. The victim then entered his bus and switched on the right indicator and waited up to a minute for LEUNG to move his car.

4. As LEUNG did not move his car, the victim exited his bus and walked over to the driver's side of LEUNG's car. At the time, LEUNG was seated in the driver's seat of his car and had his windows closed. The victim said to LEUNG in English ""excuse me"" and made a gesture with his hands indicating LEUNG move his car.

5. LEUNG, dressed in a black business suit, exited his car in possession of a black metal extendible baton. LEUNG and the victim began to argue. After about 15 seconds LEUNG lifted his right leg, kicked the victim in the left leg and struck him with the baton on the left shoulder, causing the victim to become unbalanced. The victim moved backward moving his hands over his face in a defensive gesture and kept moving away from LEUNG.

6. LEUNG moved towards the victim throwing a number of kicks to the victim's leg, punches and strikes which impacted with the victim's head and upper shoulder area. LEUNG struck the victim repeatedly to the face using his baton. The victim in self defence threw a number of punches at LEUNG. The entire incident was captured on close circuit television and witnessed by a number of independent witnesses.

7. As a result of the assault, the victim was conveyed to St Vincent's Hospital Sydney to undergo treatment. The victim sustained a 4cm laceration to the top of his skull which required stitches and facial haematomas.

8. The police were called to the scene. LEUNG was arrested and cautioned. The black metal extendible baton was seized by police and found to contain blood on it.

9. At 11.22pm, LEUNG participated in an electronic record of interview with police at the Rocks Police Station and made the following admissions:

(i) He had parked his car in a non-stopping zone;
(ii) He did not move his car because he was waiting for his partner to come back;
(iii) He purchased the extendible baton a few years ago in Melbourne when he was a licensed martial arts instructor;
(iv) He had trained for 8 years in martial arts gaining a first level black belt and trained in punching and kicking;
(v) He kept the baton in his car because he was of the view the road and people in Sydney were unsafe and wanted to protect himself;
(vi) He kicked and punched the victim and hit the victim with his baton in the shoulder and head area and
(vii) He had over reacted and thought he acted in that manner due to some money issues he had the previous night with his uncle."" 

10The sentencing judge observed that the victim suffered a 4 cm laceration to the left side of the forehead requiring stitches, and bruising to the throat and the leg of the victim. His Honour observed:

""Whilst the physical and psychological injury was towards the low end of the scale for such wounding injuries, they were nonetheless serious"". (Remarks on Sentence at p 4)

11A report of a neurologist, Dr Peter Puhl dated 15 February 2013 was tendered in evidence. It noted that the victim had suffered post-traumatic benign positional vertigo, and that he had some headaches and sensory changes on the left side of his face, but no other objective neurological deficits.

12The report noted that he consequently experienced some depression and post-traumatic stress.

13The sentencing judge had a Victim Impact Statement from the victim dated 27 June 2013 (Exhibit 3).

14Also tendered in evidence was CCTV footage (Exhibit 1) showing the attack upon the victim. The footage was played during the hearing of the appeal.

15The sentencing judge concluded that the facts revealed two objectively serious offences: Remarks on Sentence at p 3.

16The sentencing judge noted that the attack on the victim was unprovoked, the victim having only asked the applicant to move his motor vehicle so that he could move his bus. His Honour stated:

""Taking these factors in consideration I think the objective seriousness of the offence is toward the middle range for such offending.

The possess a prohibited weapon offence - a metal extendable baton in this offence is also very serious, the baton being designed to be used on people either in attack or defence. It was not a knife or a gun, but given the purpose for which it was designed it is capable of inflicting injury on another, but as a weapon falls towards the low end of the scale of weapons."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 4)

17In considering sentence, his Honour accepted medical evidence (referred to below) that the applicant, at the time of the offence, suffered from what was referred to as ""moderate"" Asperger's Syndrome - an autism spectrum disorder.

18In relation to subjective factors, his Honour noted that the applicant was 33 years of age and that he had been educated in primary school in Hong Kong before moving to Australia to complete his primary and senior school education.

19After leaving school he completed an accounting degree at Macquarie University. He had held various accounting type jobs with chartered accountants and then a mortgage and property business. He then worked in sales for a company for three years. The applicant met his fiancée some years before. She had a fashion and alterations business and he started helping her in that business.

20The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was remorseful for his offending. He had given evidence before the sentencing judge and expressed the fact that he was ""very sorry that he caused the injuries to the victim and that what he did was an 'overreaction'"": Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

21The sentencing judge recognised and recorded that the diagnosed mental disorder from which the applicant suffered was relevant to the question of deterrence in the sentencing exercise and was a mitigating factor in that less weight was to be given to deterrence.

22His Honour also stated that in his view the applicant's need for ongoing treatment was a special circumstance which permitted him to vary the statutory ratio between the non-parole and parole periods.

23His Honour also accepted the evidence of Dr Canaris, psychiatrist, that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, and noted that he had no criminal record. The sentencing judge further noted that the criminal acts in respect of Count 1 were spontaneous and they were not part of any planned criminal activity.

24His Honour had regard to references that were tendered on behalf of the applicant which attested to his prior good character.

25His Honour had regard to a number of factors in determining the sentence to be imposed with respect to Count 1. These included: the nature of the weapon, its purpose and the circumstances of the wounding including the degree of violence that was involved, the ferocity of the attack on the victim, and the fact that it was unprovoked and in a public place and the applicant's mental conditions. The sentencing judge considered that the only appropriate sentence was one of full-time custody: Remarks on Sentence at p 7.

Submissions

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in imposing a fixed term

26In relation to Ground 1, the submission was that his Honour erred in imposing a fixed term with respect to the offence of possess a prohibited weapon having regard to the provisions of s 45(1) of the Sentencing Act.

27The Crown properly conceded that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a fixed term. The Crown also noted that his Honour did not give reasons for declining to set a non-parole period as required by s 45(2) of the Sentencing Act.

Ground 2: The sentence in relation to the prohibited weapon is manifestly excessive

28In the submissions for the applicant it was observed that before the application of the 25% discount for the applicant's plea, the starting point would have been 12 months for the prohibited weapons offence. It was noted that his Honour correctly observed that the weapon was at the ""low end"" of the scale. Had he been sentenced for this offence alone, it was submitted for the applicant that it was most unlikely that he would have received a custodial sentence.

29The written submissions for the applicant referred to sentencing statistics published by the Judicial Commission and annexed a copy of the statistics to the submissions. Whilst it was acknowledged that caution must be applied in the use of sentencing statistics, it was submitted they nonetheless show that the overwhelming majority of such offences are dealt with summarily.

30In its response, the Crown in its written submissions submitted that the statistical range available was so low as to provide no real assistance.

31In terms of the criminality involved in both the prohibited weapons offence and the reckless wounding offence, the submission for the applicant was that the criminality involved in the former was subsumed by the latter. It was submitted that the effect of the three month period of accumulation was that the applicant had been ""doubly punished"" for the substance of the prohibited weapons offence. Reliance was placed upon the relevant principle stated in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 612, [43].

32In response, the Crown submitted that there were no common elements between the two offences and that the criminality of the possession of the prohibited weapon was separate and distinct from the reckless wounding offence. Further, the Crown submitted that the decision to accumulate in respect of sentences is fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge.

33The applicant's written submissions acknowledged that whilst strictly not an ""element"" of the s 35(4) offence, the Crown relied upon the use and therefore the possession of the extendible baton to particularise the s 35(4) offence.

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the applicant's psychiatric condition

34In the submissions for the applicant it was observed that the sentencing judge accepted the evidence relating to the diagnosis of the applicant's Asperger's syndrome, being the evidence of both Dr Canaris and Mr Milic. I note that the applicant was only diagnosed with that condition following the subject offence occurring on 26 November 2012. However, it was submitted that his Honour did not explicitly refer to the applicant's anxiety disorder, other than quoting passages in which the latter disorder was adverted to by both Dr Canaris and Mr Milic.

35It was acknowledged in the submissions for the applicant that the applicant's ""psychiatric condition"" was taken into account when assessing the importance of general deterrence. However, error was said to have arisen in the sentencing judge's failure to take the evidence of the applicant's medical condition into account when assessing (i) the objective seriousness of the offence and (ii) the impact that a custodial sentence would have on him. These, it was observed, were matters which counsel then appearing for the applicant directed his Honour's attention to.

36The issue of mental illness or intellectual/psychological disability, and its relevance to sentencing, was addressed in the applicant's submissions by reference to well known authorities of this Court, including in particular: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 and R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 and R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38.

37The submission was that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the evidence which established that the Asperger's condition contributed to the commission of the offence in question in a material way. Accordingly, the submission was that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced on account of his impairment. 

38It was also submitted for the applicant that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on a person who was a ""mentally ill person"": Written Submissions at 6.12. In this respect it was submitted that the sentencing judge did not make any reference to how the applicant's psychiatric condition would impact upon the applicant's experience of custody and, in particular, no reference was made to the observations of Dr Canaris both in his report and in oral evidence on this aspect.

39The Crown observed that the sentencing judge did take into account the applicant's ""psychiatric condition"" in a number of ways as set out in its written submissions at paragraph [21].

40The Crown submitted that the approach taken by the sentencing judge was consistent with the application of the relevant principle: Crown's Written Submissions at [22].

41In relation to the issue of the impact of the applicant's mental condition on his experience of custody it was submitted that his Honour had taken that aspect into account insofar as his Honour's remarks record:

""... balancing this with the subjective factors in the offender's favour, including his moderate Asberger's [sic] Syndrome which will impact upon his custodial sentence ...""

42The Crown submitted that no error had been established in the consideration of the applicant's mental condition and the ground of appeal should be dismissed. In the event that the Court determined that there was error, then the Crown submitted the Court would not be satisfied that some lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

Grounds 4 and 5

43The written submissions on behalf of the applicant and the Crown both addressed matters in respect of Grounds 4 and 5. 

44I do not here set out the submissions in relation to Ground 4 although, of course, they have been fully considered.

45In relation to Ground 5, it was submitted that the sentencing judge did not give consideration to all possible alternatives before imposing a custodial sentence. This, it was contended, resulted from the imposition of a manifestly excessive sentence on the second count, the erroneous accumulation of that sentence and the failure to give effect to the discount for the plea of guilty.

46The written submissions refer to the matters raised in the submissions before the sentencing judge. However, the submission to this Court was that there was no indication that his Honour actually gave proper consideration to ""all possible alternatives"" as required by s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act.

47The Crown observed in its written submissions at paragraph [28] that at no stage was it submitted to the sentencing judge that a sentence other than a term of imprisonment was appropriate for the offence of reckless wounding. The submission for the applicant was that his Honour should make an intensive correction order or a suspended sentence.

48The Crown referred to the approach to be taken in the sentencing process as set out in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [24], [25], [26] and [28].

49The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge's determination of a sentence of 25 months for the reckless wounding offence precluded any alternative to full-time imprisonment. The Crown submitted there was no error in the approach taken and that this ground of appeal should be dismissed.

50The Crown's overall submission was that there was no error in Grounds 2 to 5 in the appeal but that in the event error had been demonstrated, then no lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. It was submitted that should leave to appeal be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.

Consideration

51I will firstly consider the grounds of appeal relied upon in relation to the principal offence, the offence of reckless wounding (Grounds 3, 4 and 5). I will then proceed to deal with the sentence in respect of the offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act (Grounds 1 and 2).

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the applicant's psychiatric condition

52The central submission made on behalf of the applicant as noted above, was that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the expert evidence in respect of the applicant's psychiatric condition when assessing: 

(1) The objective seriousness of the offence; and
(2) The impact that a custodial sentence would have upon him.

53It is a well established sentencing principle that mental illness or intellectual/psychological disability is a relevant factor in sentencing an offender. Firstly, it is relevant to the question of the culpability of the offender. Secondly, it may render an offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[35].

54In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23], Chief Justice Spigelman observed:

""To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law ...""

See also R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at [41].

55In evaluating the offence, the sentencing judge was required to assess all relevant objective and subjective factors. The evidence before his Honour included the report of Dr Christopher Canaris, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 20 January 2013.

56In addition, the report of Mr Mark Milic, Clinical & Forensic Psychologist, dated 18 June 2013 was tendered in evidence. 

57Dr Canaris carried out a detailed history of the applicant and carried out a mental state examination of him. He stated that there was no evidence of psychosis or of organic brain syndrome but concluded and diagnosed that the applicant suffered from Asperger's syndrome. He also noted in his report that the applicant had been burdened by moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder with panic attacks, which he said seemed to have been a long-standing condition. Dr Canaris noted that patients with Asperger's syndrome frequently suffer comorbid conditions including anxiety disorders.

58Dr Canaris observed:

""His anxiety disorder seems to have caused him significant problems in the recent past and I note that he is portrayed in the documentation as a tense and hypervigilant individual who prior to the incident in question had been reported to be sleeping poorly and reported as feeling sad, empty and hopeless."" (at p 7) 

59Dr Canaris noted that the applicant described the attack upon the victim as being as if he was:

""... outside his body at the time of the attack suggesting a dissociative element at the time in question. I note that he volunteered this information without giving it undue emphasis suggesting an untutored account."" (at p 7)

60Dr Canaris proceeded to explain the dissociation. He considered that the applicant's difficulties with reading body language would very likely have contributed to his perception that the mini bus driver was threatening. He noted that his concurrent anxiety and sensitivity to noise would have added to his distress when the driver sounded his horn.

61Dr Canaris explained that whilst he described the applicant's fears as irrational, it suggested a misinterpretation of his situation and observed that he seems to have responded ""... very excessively in a reflexive manner to a threat which (if at all present) [was] far less than he thought ..."": at p 7. 

62Finally, Dr Canaris predicted that the applicant's capacity to survive a custodial sentence was extremely limited. He considered that he would be at extreme risk in custody from inmates and would find it difficult to adjust to the demands of prison officers, particularly given his difficulties with correctly identifying implicit as opposed to explicit demands: at p 8.

63It is clear that although the sentencing judge had regard to the applicant's medical condition in relation to the issue of general deterrence, his Honour did not give effect to the medical evidence in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence in light of the principles to which I have earlier referred and, in particular, as stated by the then Chief Justice in R v Hemsley.

64Mr Mark Milic, Clinical and Forensic Psychologist, in his report dated 18 June 2013 set out a detailed history, the results of psychometric assessment and details concerning the applicant's progress in psychotherapy sessions conducted between January and May 2013.


65Mr Milic included in his report:

""Mr Leung's social skills deficits and personality style, which are most likely due to autism spectrum disorder, left him vulnerable to developing an anxiety and interpersonal problems. In particular, deficits in assertive skills left Mr Leung vulnerable to a pattern of passive acceptance of interpersonal frustration leading to a build-up of tension which is followed by an aggressive outburst."" (at p 12)

66Mr Milic expressed the opinion that the offences committed by the applicant appeared to be incongruous with his otherwise pro-social character and were most likely triggered by his mental health conditions. He noted that due to his autism spectrum disorder the applicant has struggled to communicate assertively and understand people's motivations. That deficit was exacerbated, he considered, by high levels of chronic anxiety.

67I am of the opinion that appellable error has been established in terms of Ground 3 of the Grounds of Appeal. The medical opinion of Dr Canaris and the psychological assessment of Mr Milic both establish a clear contribution or causal association between the commission of the reckless wounding offence and the applicant's Asperger's syndrome aggravated as it was by his diagnosed anxiety disorder. The attack upon the victim plainly was completely out of character with his pre-offending history and was a major contributing factor to the reckless wounding offence under s 35(4) of the Crimes Act.

68Whilst the sentencing judge took the applicant's medical condition into account on the question of general deterrence, he did not give effect to the medical evidence on the issue of causation and its significance in terms of its relevance to the moral culpability of the applicant. The medical evidence clearly established that his out-of-character and bizarre behaviour had its explanation in his impaired judgment and his ability to control his faculties and emotions. Furthermore, given the medical evidence (see [81] below) appropriate allowance had to be given to the additional hardship, in the prison context, likely to result from the applicant's mental condition.

69In those circumstances, the sentence imposed for the reckless wounding offence must be set aside and the applicant re-sentenced.

70The conclusion which I have expressed in relation to Ground 3 makes it unnecessary for me to determine Grounds 1, 2(ii) and 4.

71In relation to Ground 5, it was submitted to the sentencing judge that a sentence other than a term of imprisonment was the only appropriate one for the reckless wounding offence. The submission to his Honour was that an intensive correction order or suspended sentence was appropriate. In any event, given the serious nature of the offence, I am not satisfied that there existed an alternative to a term of imprisonment.

72Whilst in relation to Grounds 2(i) and 5, the sentencing judge did not err in concluding that a custodial sentence should be imposed in respect of the reckless wounding offence, that is not the case in respect of the prohibited weapons offence.

73The finding made by the sentencing judge in respect of the latter offence was that the nature of the weapon was such that it fell at the low end of the scale of weapons to which the legislation applied. That finding, with respect, was clearly correct. The offence, on the facts of this case, standing alone, is one that would normally be expected to be prosecuted in the Local Court and for such an offence a custodial sentence would be most unlikely. In other words, for that offence I consider there was an alternative to the imposition of a term of imprisonment, which is a matter I will deal with in relation to re-sentencing.

74However, in the circumstances, both the reckless wounding offence and the prohibited weapons offence having been related by reason of the factual circumstances of the case, the applicant was understandably prosecuted in the District Court.

75Section 5(1) of the Sentencing Act provides that:

""A court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.""

76It is not apparent from the Remarks on Sentence that his Honour gave any particular consideration to possible alternatives other than a custodial sentence for the prohibited weapons offence.

77I accept the submission on behalf of the applicant that there is a significant overlap between the two offences in question and that, at least to a significant extent, the prohibited weapons offence was largely subsumed within the reckless wounding offence.

78I consider in all the circumstances that a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for the offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act was manifestly excessive even allowing for the fact that the sentence was only accumulated by a period of 3 months on the sentence for the offence under s 35(4) of the Crimes Act. The sentence for the prohibited weapons offence should be quashed and set aside.

Re-Sentencing

79In considering the question of re-sentencing, I have had regard to the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence under s 35(4) of the Crimes Act is 14 years and that there is a standard non-parole period prescribed of 3 years. The standard non-parole period, is, of course, to be taken into account as a guide together with all relevant objective and subjective factors. 

80Mr Dhanji SC who appeared with Mr Johnston in this Court on behalf of the applicant tendered a report from Dr Canaris dated 8 March 2014 and relied upon an affidavit of Ms Tsu Jong sworn on 13 March 2014 as material relevant on the question of re-sentencing.

81The report of Dr Canaris dated 8 March 2014 confirms that the applicant continues to show evidence of an autism spectrum disorder and evidence of ongoing moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder with panic features. Dr Canaris has stated that the conditions of custody have exacerbated both conditions. He stated that the applicant's fear and anxiety are far in excess of what he has encountered in most prisoners. Dr Canaris concluded that the applicant's incarceration comprises a far greater burden for him than for a typical prison by reason of his psychiatric disorders which have gone untreated in the prison setting: at p 5.

82Finally, Dr Canaris considered that the applicant ""would be highly amenable to treatment"": see report 20 January 2013.

83For the reasons set out above, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld. I have also concluded that the applicant should be re-sentenced on the following bases:

(1) In relation to the offence of reckless wounding under s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900, a finding of special circumstances should be made having regard to the applicant's need for appropriate medical treatment in the community. 

(2) As the offence under s 35(4), has a prescribed standard non-parole period of three years, the Court is required to fix a non-parole and parole period and not a fixed term: See SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]-[78]. In that respect I propose that the non-parole period should be the period that the applicant has been in custody to date.

84I accordingly consider that the applicant should be re-sentenced to period of imprisonment of 12 months comprising:

(i) A non-parole period equivalent to the period of imprisonment served by the applicant, being a period of 8 months and 13 days, commencing on 26 July 2013 and expiring today, 7 April 2014.

(ii) A balance of term of 3 months and 18 days commencing on 8 April 2013 and expiring on 25 July 2014.

85In relation to the offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act, the applicant, Simon Yuk Leung, be directed pursuant to s 9 of the Sentencing Act to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 1 year from 7 April 2014.

86Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(1) Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the District Court on 26 July 2013 be granted.

(2) Appeal allowed.

(3) The applicant be re-sentenced as follows:

(i) In respect of the offence of reckless wounding contrary to s 35(4) Crimes Act 1900, the applicant is re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period equivalent to the period of imprisonment served by the applicant, being a period of 8 months 13 days commencing on 26 July 2013 and to expire on 7 April 2014 with a balance of term of 3 months and 18 days to commence on 8 April 2013 and to expire on 25 July 2014.

(ii) In respect of the offence of possess prohibited weapon contrary to s 7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, the applicant be directed pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 1 year from 7 April 2014.

87The applicant is accordingly eligible for parole today, 7 April 2014.

2763649,Ali v R [2014] NSWCCA 45,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Button J for the reasons given by his Honour. Since the consequence is a new and lesser sentence for a very serious sexual assault, I wish to explain why it is required by law. The account of the factual background provided by Button J enables me to turn to the legal issues immediately. 

2Both the primary judge who imposed the sentence in 2008 and the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2010 were bound by R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 to have regard to the standard non-parole period (in this case, seven years). Those courts did so. However, the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 made what had been done in 2008 and 2010 legally erroneous. As much was conceded by the Crown. 

3Statute provides for further review in these circumstances, pursuant to s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), but only if (relevantly) there appears to be a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance in the case. It is now established that sentencing which by reason of Muldrock has become legally erroneous answers that description: Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383 (as to which see further below). In accordance with that decision, a judge referred the whole case to this Court to be dealt with once more as an appeal. 

4In light of the Crown's concession of error, the question posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is whether a less severe sentence is warranted in law. The Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted. However, in order to determine whether that is so, this Court in 2014 is required to have regard to the evidence before it relating to Mr Ali's imprisonment over the last 6 years since 8 November 2007. That was established by Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 154; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124], where the authorities were comprehensively reviewed, and has regularly been applied subsequently. The Crown made no submission to the contrary. 

5That evidence before this Court demonstrates two matters. The first (and less important) is that Mr Ali's sentence has been more arduous than that of many offenders. The first 12 months were served on protection (first as a Protection Requiring Limited Association inmate, and then as a Special Management Area Placement inmate) where he was locked in 23 hours each day. For the next 3 years he was locked in for 13 hours a day (no differently from the majority of inmates at Junee Correctional Centre) but was otherwise confined to the pod and excluded from the garden and recreational areas save for 1 hour per week. He has been, since December 2011, located in the C unit, and has progressed to C2 status. He has successfully undertaken a wide variety of courses while in prison, and has not incurred any internal disciplinary charges. This is less important for present purposes because the general nature of the likely conditions of his imprisonment was reasonably foreseeable at the time sentence was imposed, given the nature of the offence.

6The second (and more important) matter is that contrary to the position at trial, and before this Court in 2010, Mr Ali has now acknowledged his wrongdoing. He signed the referral for the CUBIT program in June 2011 and has completed 11 of the 14 sessions in the Preparatory Program for Sexual Offenders. That took place before the Legal Aid Commission advised him (in October 2012) that his sentence was being reviewed following Muldrock. 

7Mr Ali's sworn evidence as to the steps he has belatedly taken was confirmed by the Crown. There was no application by the Crown to cross-examine Mr Ali's sworn evidence of his remorse over the last three years. The Crown made no submissions to the contrary. It would be wrong to reject any of this evidence as insincere or opportunistic, in the absence of any challenge to it. 

8Statute requires a court imposing a sentence to have regard to the remorse shown by the offender, but only if (relevantly) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and has acknowledged the injury caused by his or her actions: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 21A(3)(i). The unchallenged evidence on appeal satisfies those conditions. The same statute also requires a court to have regard to whether the offender is unlikely to re-offend, and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g) and (h). Remorse is a major factor in determining whether those further matters of mitigation exist: R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim 159 at [41].

9Contrary to the Crown's submissions, a less severe sentence is warranted in law. The sentencing court in 2008 saw a man who displayed no remorse, and who for that reason did not have good prospects of rehabilitation, and who might re-offend in the future. The position in 2014 is quite different. The mitigating factors are material. 

10The final question is what is the appropriate sentence for the very serious sexual assault committed. I agree with Button J that there is no occasion for a finding of special circumstances so as to reduce the ratio of the non-parole period and the sentence imposed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), and that it is appropriate to replicate the structure at first instance, so that this Court's sentence dates from 4 November 2007.

11Most sentencing courts lack the benefit of hindsight, and there will be few cases such as the present where the position as known on review in 2014 is so different from what was known or anticipated in 2008. (It is not the test at law, but I have no doubt that if the sentencing court in 2008 had known that Mr Ali would, albeit belatedly, acknowledge his guilt for a very serious sexual assault and would be making sustained positive steps towards his rehabilitation, a significantly lesser sentence would have been imposed.) The mitigating factors referred to above, considered in conjunction with the other matters relevant to sentence drawn together by Button J, cause me to agree with his Honour in ordering a new sentence of 8 years and 8 months (reduced from 10 years and 8 months), with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months (reduced from 8 years). 

12The rules within the Australian legal system change over time. They may change when new statutes are enacted (which are usually prospective but may be retrospective). In a practical sense, the rules also change when courts give a new legal meaning to existing statutes. In this country, that is inevitably retrospective; it reflects the nature of judicial power: Ha v State of NSW (1997) 189 CLR 465 at 504.

13The rules within the legal system must be susceptible to change, but change comes at a price. What to do where retrospective change causes what was formerly legally correct to become legally erroneous is a large problem. The position can be very stark. Deane J said of the overruling of Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 that ""It is simply wrong that an accused may be adjudged not guilty or guilty of murder according to the chance of whether his trial is completed before or after this Court has abolished a defence ..."": Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 678 (legislation reversing the position was subsequently enacted). Concerns such as these were at the forefront of the dissenting reasons of Heydon and Bell JJ in PGA v The Queen [2012] HCA 21; 245 CLR 355 at [125]-[136] and [242]-[247]. In short, it is a large thing for an appellate court to change a settled rule of law or a settled construction given to statute, especially in the area of crime, as occurred in Muldrock.

14This present appeal reflects a different aspect of the problem, when retrospective change calls into question verdicts and sentences imposed many years previously, when the time for appeals is long since past. A ""central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances"": Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 at [15]. Most commonly, it arises when an appeal is brought out of time, for the appeal process is the principal qualification on the tenet of finality in litigation: Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10 at [35]. One approach, not without support in the judicial decisions to which I referred in Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 at [2]-[7], would be to treat such change as insufficient to warrant appellate intervention, in the absence of exceptional circumstances. That approach was drawn upon by way of analogy to applications under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001: see Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342 at [33]-[38], but a different approach was applied when her Honour's decision was reviewed by the Court of Appeal. It remains open to Parliament to alter the law if it is of the view that a different approach ought to be adopted in circumstances such as these, as was noted in Achurch at [35].

15The present state of the law is that statute requires this Court to review the sentence imposed on Mr Ali in 2008, so that the legal error made in 2008 but only identified by the High Court's decision in 2011 may be corrected. In conducting that review, this Court is required to have regard to evidence not available to the sentencing judge. This Court is required to have regard by way of mitigation to the unchallenged evidence of Mr Ali's remorse and progress towards rehabilitation. In short, the existence of this further appeal, as well as its outcome, turns upon statute and the fact that, as was said in PGA at [133], ""The courts are masters of the common law, but servants of statutes."" This Court's sentence results from the passing of sentence according to the statutes which bind it.

16BUTTON J: This sentence appeal comes before the Court by way of a referral pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). Accordingly, leave to appeal is not required: Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14.

Issue

17The foundation of the appeal is the submission that, in sentencing the appellant for an offence that attracted a standard non-parole period, Judge Berman SC sentenced in accordance with principles enunciated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 that were subsequently disapproved in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. It is also submitted that, in dismissing an appeal against sentence, the Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded on the same erroneous principles.

18In this Court, the Crown Prosecutor expressly conceded that the error asserted was established. The real point of controversy in the appeal became whether the test contained in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) had been made out and a lesser sentence is warranted in law. As a result, my review of the history of the matter can be brief.

Sentence in the District Court

19On 14 November 2008, Judge Berman sentenced the appellant for three offences, each of which had been the subject of a guilty verdict after a trial by jury. The first two counts were indecent assaults, brought pursuant to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and attracts no standard non-parole period. (The third count had resulted in an acquittal and need not be discussed further.) The fourth count was sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the victim was not consenting, brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years, and attracts a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

20In this Court, there was no dispute that, in considering the test in s 6(3), one could adopt the findings of fact made by Judge Berman about objective and subjective features, subject to supplementation by subsequent events. The findings of his Honour may be summarised as follows.

21On the evening of 3 November 2007, the victim, a young woman, went out for drinks with friends in Sydney. She became intoxicated to the point of being physically ill. Concerned for her well-being and security, her friends placed her in a taxi and arranged for her to be taken home. The appellant was the driver of the taxi.

22Throughout the journey, the state of intoxication of the victim was readily apparent, due to the fact that she vomited again out of the window of the taxi, and was drifting in and out of sleep or unconsciousness.

23The appellant did not take the victim home. Instead, he sexually assaulted her. He touched one of her breasts under her clothing, and touched her between her legs. At the time of the first of those crimes the victim made her lack of consent perfectly clear; at the time of the latter crime she was unconscious. These acts constituted the two offences of indecent assault. 

24The appellant then drove the victim to a secluded location and disabled the in-car security video. There, he sexually assaulted her by having penile/vaginal intercourse with her without her consent, well knowing that she was not consenting. The sexual intercourse was not protected by way of the use of a condom, and the appellant ejaculated inside the body of the victim. Throughout the crime the victim was making her lack of consent perfectly clear by saying ""No, no, no"". She also began crying when the offence commenced. 

25After the assault had ended, the victim telephoned emergency services in a highly distressed state.

26At trial, the appellant did not deny that the sexual contact complained of had taken place. However, he claimed that, far from the victim being the aggrieved party with regard to that contact, she was the instigator of it. Clearly, the jury rejected that proposition beyond reasonable doubt, and Judge Berman described it as ""palpably false"".

27His Honour accepted that the victim had suffered ""terrible consequences"" as a result of the offending of the appellant. However, because his Honour did not assess those consequences as being above and beyond those that one would expect any victim of such a sexual assault to suffer, his Honour did not take them into account as an aggravating feature.

28In the proceedings on sentence, it was established that the appellant had been convicted of nothing more than driving matters before the commission of these offences, and his Honour therefore regarded him as a person of previous good character. Born in Bangladesh, he was aged 22 years at the time of the imposition of sentence. He had come to Australia in search of educational opportunities, and at the time of the offences was studying accounting. He was driving a taxi to support himself in this country.

29At the time of sentence, the appellant maintained his innocence. As a result, his Honour found that there was no remorse whatsoever on his part. That finding informed further adverse findings about the prospects of rehabilitation and the danger of reoffending.

30In the event, on each of the two counts of indecent assault, his Honour imposed fixed terms of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 4 November 2007 and expire on 3 November 2009. With regard to the count founded upon sexual intercourse without consent, his Honour imposed a head sentence of 10 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 8 years to commence on 4 November 2007. The non-parole period expires on 3 November 2015, and the head sentence expires on 3 July 2018.

31It can be seen that the sentences for the indecent assaults are concurrent with each other. They are also concurrent with, and fully subsumed within, the non-parole period of the most serious offence.

Approach to the standard non-parole period at first instance and on first appeal

32His Honour sentenced the appellant during the currency of the principles enunciated in R v Way. With regard to the standard non-parole period, his Honour said: 

The offence of sexual intercourse without consent carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of seven years. The standard non-parole period is appropriate for an offence in the middle of the range for objective seriousness. Here the objective seriousness was high, involving full penile/ vaginal intercourse, including the offender ejaculating. He did not, of course, use a condom.

...

I have found ... that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Even taking into account the mitigating factors in the offender's favour, I have determined that the non-parole period will be greater than that provided for an offence in the middle of the range, that is the seven year standard non-parole period sentence. I have also determined that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 on the indictment will be served wholly concurrently, they being part and parcel really of what occurred to [the victim] that evening. There are no special circumstances in this case. To take into account matters such as the offender's good character in making a finding of special circumstances would be to double count. It is the offender's first time in custody and that has sometimes been held, indeed often been held, to be a special circumstance, but the non-parole period I will shortly announce is the shortest which I consider is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

33An appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 2 March 2010. That was also during the currency of the principles contained in R v Way. During the course of a judgment that rejected four grounds of appeal, Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL (as his Honour then was) and RS Hulme J agreed) said at [63]:

It was necessary for the sentence to be passed on the Applicant to reflect the sentencing Judge's appropriate finding that the offence lay above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this class of offence. The standard non-parole period of seven years had direct application given that the Applicant had been convicted after trial: R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]. Subjective factors operated in the Applicant's favour but, in the circumstances of the case, it was necessary for condign punishment to be imposed, reflecting significant elements of specific and general deterrence.

Error conceded by the Crown

34On 19 December 2013, Latham J granted an application for a referral of the matter to this court. Her Honour experienced a ""doubt or question"" founded upon the possibility that the remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge, along with the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal ""applied sentencing principles that have since been discredited"" (that is, they demonstrated ""Muldrock error""). Her Honour records that the Crown conceded that such an error was revealed in the remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge and also in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

35As I have said, in this Court the Crown maintained the position that, both at first instance and in the Court of Criminal Appeal, there had been an overly rigid and direct application of the standard non-parole period to the question of sentencing for the sexual intercourse offence. The real point of dispute was the question of re-sentence, and whether this Court would be affirmatively satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law with regard to count four.



Lesser sentence warranted in law?

36In support of that proposition, counsel for the appellant read an affidavit sworn by the appellant on 17 February 2014. The Crown Prosecutor did not require the appellant for cross-examination, although she did read an affidavit of a prison employee that clarified some of the claims of the appellant about the circumstances of his incarceration. Of course, none of that material was available to the learned sentencing judge over five years ago.

37The appellant is now 28 years of age. He has led an isolated existence in custody. The friends that he had made in this country ended contact with him after he was incarcerated. The result is that he has received no visits over the past six years. Due to a lack of funds, he is only able to telephone family and friends in Bangladesh for 10 minutes each month. As a result of a combination of factors, not the least being the notoriety of his crime within the prison system, for some years the appellant was on various forms of protection, at first quite restrictive, and subsequently less so. Throughout the years he has been progressing well, working and doing courses, and has now achieved C2 classification.

38Most importantly, the appellant has come to accept his guilt of these sordid crimes. In his recent affidavit he deposed ""I know that I should not have done what I did, as a human being to another human being."" He has also commenced to address his criminality by undertaking the ""Preparatory Program for Sexual Offenders"" in anticipation of undertaking CUBIT, the well-known program for sex offenders in custody. As at the date of the hearing of the appeal, the appellant had attended 11 of the requisite 14 sessions in the preparatory program.

39In considering whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law on count four, I have regarded the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and the standard non-parole period of 7 years as important guideposts. 

40I have reflected upon the profound objective gravity of these offences, encompassing as they did a sexual attack upon a very vulnerable victim who was fully justified in looking to the appellant for protection rather than predation. 

41I have also borne in mind that the crime in count four featured a degree of calm execution (demonstrated by way of the disabling of the in-car video) and were made more deplorable by the fact of ejaculation within the body of the victim, thereby exposing her to the risk of pregnancy or potentially fatal sexually transmitted disease. 

42There was a degree of leniency in the original sentence structure by way of the sentences for the indecent assaults being wholly subsumed within the sentence for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. 

43Finally, there is force in the submission of the Crown Prosecutor in this Court that the admission of guilt and expressions of remorse of the appellant are delayed by many years; certainly, they do nothing to ameliorate the fact that the victim was subject to the ordeal of a criminal trial, which included having a completely false alternative proposition put to her.

44On the other hand, one now knows that the circumstances of incarceration of the appellant have been unusually difficult. It is also the fact that, albeit late, he has admitted his guilt and is seeking to do something about it by getting psychological help. More generally, he has used his time in custody as constructively as he can. I have also borne in mind the fact that, before the commission of these crimes, the appellant was without relevant criminal antecedents.

45In all the circumstances, there can be no doubt that a lengthy head sentence and non-parole period are inevitable in order to reflect society's abhorrence for what the appellant did. Nevertheless, exercising the sentencing discretion afresh and taking into account all of the evidence old and new, I would impose a head sentence and non-parole period on the sexual intercourse count that is somewhat shorter than that imposed by his Honour many years ago. It follows that I consider that the test in section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act has been made out.

46Although I accept that the appellant has made good progress whilst serving his first lengthy sentence of imprisonment, I do not consider that special circumstances have been made out. The parole period that I propose is not an insubstantial one. Separately, I consider that the non-parole period is the minimum period of time that should be served by the appellant in custody for these offences.

47I indicate that, in coming to these assessments, I have disregarded the prospects of the appellant being deported, in accordance with long-standing authority of this Court: R v Van Hong Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [13]; R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315 at [21].

48I consider it appropriate to replicate the sentence structure at first instance; I propose that the new sentence on count four commence on the same day as the sentences for the two indecent assaults.

49My proposal is that the appellant be subject to a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months.

50I propose the following orders:

(1)Appeal allowed with regard to count four.

(2)Sentence on count four quashed.

(3)On count four, the appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months to date from 4 November 2007 and expire on 3 May 2014, with a parole period of 2 years and 2 months to date from 4 May 2014 and expire on 3 July 2016.

(4)The first date upon which the appellant will be eligible for consideration for release is 4 May 2014.

51RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Button J. I also agree with the reasons for Judgment of Leeming JA and Button J.

2763653,R v McKnight [2014] NSWSC 398,"Judgment

1On the 28th April 2014 Mr McKnight is to stand trial for allegedly murdering Stafford David Ray on the 25th March 2012 in the Sydney CBD. I am informed by Mr Brady of Counsel that the accused will enter a plea of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.

2Below I have set out fully the statement of the Crown case. I understand that Mr McKnight will not dispute that he kicked the deceased in the head a number of times inflicting a traumatic brain injury, from which Mr Ray died several hours later.

3Mr McKnight was originally charged with manslaughter, which was upgraded to murder before the accused had entered a plea.

4I am informed that Mr McKnight will defend the murder charge by challenging the Crown contention that in repeatedly kicking Mr Ray he actually intended to kill him or inflict really serious personal injury. In the alternative, he says that if he would otherwise be guilty of murder, his offending should be reduced to manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental condition within s 23A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He accepts that he carries the onus of establishing this partial defence on the balance of probabilities.

5Mr McKnight is seeking leave under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to make an application for trial by Judge alone out of time. Through his solicitor, Mr McKnight gave notice to the Crown some time ago of his intention to make this application and the Crown consents to the grant of leave for the application to be made out of time. The Crown does not consent to the making of a trial by Judge order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

6I grant leave for this application to be made out of time.

Legal principles

7As I have said, the Court's power to make an order for trial by Judge alone is conferred by s 132 Criminal Procedure Act. Because the prosecutor does not agree to trial by Judge alone, I may only make such an order if I consider ""it is in the interests of justice to do so"" (s 132(4)). That general discretion is to a degree limited by the provisions of s 5 (notwithstanding its opening words):

Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.


8The statute must be applied by reference to the facts and circumstances of the case under consideration. Although trial by jury is the so-called default position, there is no legal presumption favouring one mode of trial over the other. The only presumption is that the measure of justice is the same, whatever the mode of trial, whether by jury or by Judge alone.

9In these circumstances an applicant for a trial by Judge order need rebut no presumption nor discharge any formal burden of proof. The applicant does bear an evidentiary burden to introduce evidence or argument which engages the statutory discretion. As Chesterman JA said in R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 at [81] of the Queensland legislation, cited with approval in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86 by Hidden J at [118] ""an accused cannot have a trial by Judge alone for the asking"". Moreover, whilst there is no presumption, the discretion must be exercised by reference to the consideration that Parliament has assumed that in the ordinary course a trial for a serious crime on indictment should be by jury: TVM v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 299.

10In R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [42] Barr AJ (Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing) said:

The fact that the applicant has decided on legal advice to relinquish any benefit of trial by jury is something the Court should take into account, but that and any apprehension that he will not receive a fair trial at the hands of a jury must be weighed. A mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence will not be enough.
.... 

In weighing the concerns of the applicant the Court must have regard to any means available to allay them. The Court should also bear in mind that the interests of the accused are not necessarily the interests of justice. The community receives important collateral benefits from trial by jury in the involvement of the public in the administration of justice and in keeping the law in touch with community standards: Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4, (2005) 220 CLR 517 at [7].

11For the purpose of s 132(6) I am satisfied on the basis of the affidavit of his solicitor, Philip Stewart, sworn on 3rd April 2014, and read in support of the application that Mr McKnight has sought and received advice from Mr Brady of Counsel and Mr Stewart as to the effect of a trial by Judge order.

Facts and circumstances of the present case

12The following facts are drawn from the statement of the Crown case:

At about 12.50am on the morning of 25 March 2012, Stafford David Ray (the deceased; DOB 8 December 1960; 51) was sitting on the footpath, near the intersection of George Street and Campbell Street in Sydney. He was sitting with his back leaning against the wall of a shop. He was in the company of a woman called Sarah Mathieson.

While Ray was sitting on the footpath, Michael McKnight (the accused; DOB 23 January 1985; 27) was walking by. The accused and Mathieson spoke for a few minutes. After that, the accused and Mathieson sat on the ground next to Ray. The accused sat on the right hand-side of Ray.

A few moments later, the accused got up quickly. The accused then kicked Ray's head at least three times. The kicks were ""full-force"" kicks. (The assault was recorded by a CCTV camera.)

Mathieson stood up and tried to prevent the accused from assaulting Ray. Mathieson fell, or was pushed to the ground by the accused.

The accused ran away. The accused was pursued and caught by members of the public. At about 1.00am, police arrived at the scene and spoke to the RAY. RAY told them that he was kicked whilst he was sleeping. When asked if he wanted the accused charged he said ""I don't know. I have lived on the streets for a long time and I am not like that. I don't want him chasing me down the street. I just have to think about it.""

The accused was arrested by police at the scene. The accused said that the deceased had taken his money. The accused was searched and when spoken to was slurring his speech and struggling to maintain his balance but did not smell of intoxicating liquor. Once his details were taken the accused was released from police custody.

At about 1.10am, an ambulance arrived at the scene. About ten minutes later, Ray was taken to St Vincent's Hospital. After arriving at the hospital, Ray received some preliminary medical care. At about 3.45am, Ray left the hospital.

Shortly before 3.00pm, Ray's body was located in Green Park (a short distance from St Vincent's Hospital).

A post mortem examination revealed that Ray died from a subdural haemorrhage.

On the 3 April 2012 the accused was re-arrested by detectives. He declined to be interviewed by police and was charged.

Whilst at committal stage defence offered a plea to 'manslaughter' on the basis of 'no intent to cause grievous bodily harm' and 'substantial impairment'. That plea offer was not accepted by the crown.

Issues at trial will be whether the accused had the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The crown contends that intention is established by the CCTV footage of the attack which shows the accused forcefully kicking the deceased a number of times to the head.

Another issue at trial will be one of substantial impairment. Dr Olav Nielssen examined the accused on behalf of the defence and opined that the accused was substantially impaired at the time. Dr Stephen Allnut examined the accused on behalf of the crown and concluded that the accused may have been substantially impaired at the time. (Original emphasis)


13From Mr Stewart's affidavit, I accept that Mr McKnight has a ""strong preference to have a Judge alone trial"". I also accept that Mr McKnight is concerned that he will not receive a trial free of prejudice by a jury because of the high level of media coverage, and comment, about street violence, particularly death from street violence where alcohol is involved. I accept Mr McKnight is genuinely concerned about whether a jury can ignore ""that publicity when dealing with his matter"". 

14Mr McKnight has been examined by Dr Olav Nielssen at the request of his solicitors. The doctor's report of the 19th of February 2013 is Exhibit VDA. Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr McKnight as suffering from chronic schizophrenia, now in remission. He also has substance dependence and abuse disorder, also in remission. Dr Stephen Allnutt, who examined Mr McKnight on behalf of the Crown, and whose report of 10th June 2013 is Exhibit VD1, appears, in general terms, to agree with these diagnoses. However, rather than in remission, Dr Allnutt says the psychotic condition ""has now ameliorated"". 

15The experts part company on the question whether Mr McKnight's mental condition constituted an abnormality of the mind in the statutory sense, at the time of the commission of the offence. Obviously the accuracy of the opinion of each of them depends upon the reliability of the history received. However, Dr Nielssen is of the view that the schizophrenic illness is an underlying condition within the meaning of the Section ""and at the time of the offence Mr McKnight was affected by an abnormality of mind arising from an exacerbation of his underlying condition brought about by not taking anti-psychotic medication"". He considers that the defence of substantial impairment is ""open"".

16Dr Allnutt accepts that the accused was ""vulnerable to having had an abnormality of mind at the material time of the alleged offence"". Whether in fact he did is a question, in Dr Allnutt's view, that depends upon what view the tribunal of fact forms of the account given by Mr McKnight of the events surrounding his assault of Mr Ray. I infer that if that account is accepted, Dr Allnutt would accept that the accused laboured under a ""substantial impairment"" at the relevant time. At the same time Dr Allnutt points out that intoxication, and it is not in issue that Mr McKnight was affected by alcohol at the time, is ""well known to contribute to disinhibition as well as reactive aggression"".

17The review of Mr McKnight's medical history undertaken by Dr Allnutt refers to past hospitalisations for mental illness, commencing in May 2002. In February 2007, the history received on admission was that he was threatening to kill people and manifesting aggressive behaviour. His speech at that time was sexually charged. In March 2007, he was noted to be aggressive and sexually inappropriate when psychotic. Again, in May 2007 he was manifesting aggression. There seemed to be a correlation between his psychotic symptoms and cannabis use. He had been using cannabis since about the age of 14. Mr Brady argues that a jury hearing these matters may be prejudiced against Mr McKnight.

Issues and argument

18In writing and orally, Mr Brady highlighted the following matters:

(a)The interest of the administration of justice would be significantly enhanced by the provision of a reasoned decision. This was especially so when the defence case depended upon running two lines of argument which were strict alternatives. First, there was no actual intention to kill or seriously injure; and secondly, if there was, his capacity to form that intention was substantially impaired by his psychotic illness. Moreover, there were factual complexities. Alcohol consumed on the night of the killing will play a role in relation to the intention but needs to be ignored in relation to substantial impairment;

(b)There are aspects of prejudice which may affect the reasoning process of the jury impermissibly. First, there is the past history of aggressive and sexually inappropriate behaviour which might cause the jury to dislike the accused. Secondly, given a need to prove facts relevant to his medical history it would inevitably come out that he has been receiving treatment from Justice Health in custody. Finally, the media spotlight on alcohol related violence in public places might lead the jury to pre-judge the issues in the case;

(c)Whilst not decisive, a judge alone trial would be substantially more efficient, reducing the estimate from 2 to 3 weeks to 3 to 4 days (the latter not including the time necessary for a decision); 

(d)Whilst acknowledging that the second limb of s 23A(1) necessarily require the application of objective community standards, those factual issues do not require refusal of the application. No question of community standards informs a decision about Intention. It is a simple question of fact. Most, if not all, offences involved some element of intention. It could not be said that the determination of whether the accused had the necessary intention required the application of objective community standards, otherwise few, if any cases, would be suitable for determination by a judge alone.

19The Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, with impeccable fairness and balance, acknowledged the force of points (b) and (c). He argued that in this case point (a) did not really arise. It is expected that the accused would plead guilty to the serious crime of manslaughter and therefore will inevitably face proceedings on sentence at which the sentencing judge would be under an obligation to provide reasons for finding the facts relevant to the sentencing task. By this means, a reasoned judgment will be produced. Senior counsel did not concede prejudice in relation to the accused's past medical history; quite the contrary, as his past aggression was explicable by reference to his mental illness, this evidence was favourable to him and a properly instructed jury would understand that. 

20The Crown said that the current debate about alcohol related violence in public places raised legitimate concerns, but those concerns most likely could be addressed by proper instruction, direction and warning to the jury. 

21Senior counsel agreed that the probable comparable efficiency dividend of a judge alone trial in this case would be very significant indeed. While such a consideration would rarely be decisive he argued it was entitled to some weight.

22The Crown's real opposition was that the determination of the substantial impairment defence was a jury question par excellence. Doubtless, the qualitative question of whether the accused's impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for ""murder being reduced to manslaughter "" necessarily required a determination involving the application of objective community standards. The Deputy Director pointed out that the published Guidelines of the Director of Public Prosecutions proceeded on the basis that the application of community values was inherent in the second limb of s 23A. He argued that ordinarily such matters should be heard by a jury.

Determination

23I am conscious that the argument on behalf of the accused invites me to take the grounds advanced together for the purpose of deciding whether a trial by judge order is in the interests of justice. I do not regard them as being put forward in the alternative. However, it is necessary to deal with them seriatim for each of them will only add strength to the whole argument if it has some weight on its own.

24I do not regard the ""need for a reasoned judgment"" argument as persuasive. Expert evidence will inform the determination of the substantial impairment question. However, the evidence is unlikely to be complex as both psychiatrists agree that the accused suffered from a pre-existing mental condition, not of a transitory kind. In truth, the decision on that issue will depend more on other matters. It will depend upon whether the accused persuades the jury, on the balance of probabilities, that he was actually acting under the influence of his pre-existing mental condition at the time he offended. It will also depend upon the evaluative question of whether that condition was ""so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"". As Mr Brady acknowledged, this is a question requiring the application of objective community values. One would expect that a jury would have no difficulty with these issues.

25I accept that the question of intention in this case raises no question about objective community standards. However the second limb of s 23A does. This factor favours, even strongly favours, trial by jury. 

26I do not accept that the details of the accused's past medical history provides a basis for a justifiable apprehension of prejudice in prospective jurors. I accept the argument of the Deputy Director that, in truth, the objective facts about his past medical history favour the accused and that a jury will appreciate that those facts tend to prove that if his mental condition was operative at the time of the offending it may have made him violent or aggressive.

27Mr Brady is on stronger ground, as the Crown acknowledge, in saying that this is a case of alcohol related violence in a public street where the offending has been captured on CCTV footage; violence of this type may have been sensationalised by the conduct of what may be regarded as a media campaign agitating for change in laws and the public's attitude, notwithstanding that, statistically, violent crime rates seem to be falling, not rising. I think I can take judicial notice of these matters.

28In my judgment that the media campaign may have generated increased public interest favours trial by jury given the comments of Gleeson CJ in Swain v Waverley Municipal Council (2005) CLR 517. 

29However that may be, sensationalisation by media is nothing new in the legal system. There always have been, and will be, topics and cases that excite public interest and debate, and this is a healthy thing. Public interest is fundamental to the principle of open justice.

30It should be noted that it is not said that any potential prejudice is at a level where pre-trial publicity about public violence raises any question about whether Mr McKnight can receive a fair trial from a jury.

31As Bellew J said in R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448 ""proceedings such as these will invariably attract ... publicity"". At [55] - [60] his Honour pointed out that modern practises in jury trials make it routine for trial judges at the commencement of every trial ""to direct the jury that they are prohibited from undertaking any research, or making any inquiry through the internet in relation to any aspect of the trial"". These directions extend to researching, or inquiring about, the subject matter of the trial such as ""alcohol fuelled violence"". Moreover, the jury is routinely admonished to decide the case only on the basis of the evidence and arguments led and advanced in court. They are instructed to approach the decision making task calmly, rationally, and dispassionately in accordance with the oath or affirmation of each of them. Doubtless specific directions may need to be fashioned to the circumstances of the particular case in the light of the media campaign to which I have referred. But as Mason CJ and Toohey J said in R v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603:

The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant
and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law
acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the
footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions
given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence.


Their Honours cited with approval the dictum of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R v Hubbert (1975) 29 C.C.C. (2D) 279 at page 291:

In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naïve to think that in a case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.

I emphasise that this apt observation was made in 1975, long before the advent of the World Wide Web.

32I am not persuaded that the publicity surrounding alcohol fuelled violence in general, and ""single punch manslaughter"" in particular, justifies the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to grant the order sought.

33I do not think that the likely dividend in terms of saved time and cost in a judge alone trial is relevant in this case. With respect, the argument is an appeal to the ""overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial"": R v Belghar at [111]. As it was put in Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, it is a universal characteristic that jury trials are ""longer, and therefore more expensive, and procedurally more inflexible than trial by judge alone"" (per Samuels JA at 412 - 413). It is however ""not to the point to consider universal characteristics of jury trials,"" it is impermissible to take such matters into account (per Kirby P at 403, Samuels JA agreeing). This reasoning is applicable to s 132 as the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act proceed on the assumption (not presumption) that trial by jury will continue to be the norm for indictable offences.

34In my view the interests of justice do not require trial by judge alone in this case.

35My orders are:

2763662,Cherie Marise Delaney & Kenneth John Cullinan v Terrence Ralph Winn [2014] NSWDC 87,"Judgment
1The plaintiffs, Cherie Marise Delaney and Kenneth John Cullinan have sued the defendant, Terrence Ralph Winn claiming damages for breach of contract arising from what they say was the negligent carrying out of an inspection report on some property the plaintiffs intended to buy.

2The defendant, Terrence Ralph Winn was a building consultant employed by Facility Solutions Australia Pty Ltd, a company controlled by him. Facility Solutions contracted with Harding Industries Pty Ltd as trustee of the Graphic Property Trust, trading as Graphic Property Reports to provide to Graphic Property Reports building reports prepared by Mr Winn.

3The plaintiffs were interested in buying a property at 21 Alison Road Springfield and approached a real estate agent who suggested that they obtain a property inspection report from Graphic Reports.

4It seems to be common ground that the report he was to prepare was one that complied with the relevant Australian standard, AS 4349.1-1995.  

A claim framed in contract

5The statement of claim is framed in contract and alleges that on about 15 August 2006 the plaintiff agreed for reward to engage the defendant as their building consultant and the defendant accepted such engagement (Statement of Claim para 3).
6The evidence at the hearing establishes, in my opinion that there was no such contract. There is no doubt that the defendant did carry out an inspection of the property and did make available to Graphic Property Reports the results of his inspection. He was doing that as the employee of Facility Solutions Australia Proprietary Limited contracting with Graphic Property Reports. He did not make any report himself at any time to the plaintiffs in writing.

7The claim against him based on contract fails.
The claim based on negligent misstatement

8There is no doubt that subsequently, the defendant, following a request by the real estate agent to Graphic Reports, did attend the premises in the presence of the first plaintiff and her father. The first plaintiff, who was the only one of the two plaintiffs to give evidence, claimed that he, the defendant, attended on two occasions. He denied attending on two occasions and I accept his evidence, in preference to the evidence of the first plaintiff, on this point.

9The proceedings were conducted, as I saw it, on a type of tacit understanding that although there was clearly no contract between the plaintiffs on the one hand and the defendant, nevertheless the defendant appreciated that he was providing a report that would be provided to a potential purchaser of the property and that the purchaser would probably rely on that report to some extent in deciding whether or not to purchase the property. This could mean that the defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiffs that would render him liable to them if he negligently carried out an inspection and was the cause of a report that was wrong or inadequate AND that the loss which was suffered was causally related to the alleged breach of duty. 

10The loss claimed included financial loss and for being ""put to great trouble, inconvenience, mortgage interest, mortgage expenses, other expenses and mental harm""(Statement of Claim para 15).

11Some basis was put for financial loss arising from the plaintiffs purchasing the property, the claim being that they could have purchased other properties at a profit or at the very least they could expect damages being the difference between what they paid for the property, $318,000 plus the interest they had to pay on borrowing for this property and the costs they outlaid, less $274,621.00, the sale price for the property when it was sold by them 3 years later.

12There was also a claim for mental harm.
Evidence of the plaintiff 

13The first plaintiff gave evidence in an affidavit supplemented by oral evidence.

14She first spoke of the residence in which she lived before purchasing the property that is the subject of the litigation. That first property was at Wattle Street East, Gosford. She had discussions with the other plaintiff, her de-facto husband, the second plaintiff and they decided that they would purchase another property leaving Wattle Street as the first plaintiff's investment property. They decided to buy the new property in joint names.

15A real estate agent showed them the property at 21 Allison Road. The property at the time was unoccupied and was a split-level house on a steep slope with a garage on the land above the house.

16The plaintiff and her husband went to look at the house, accompanied by the agent and they decided to make some further enquiries. Because of her previous experience in purchasing the house at Wattle Street, the first plaintiff decided that they should get a property inspection report. She then asked the agent to arrange for a property inspection. The agent arranged for an organisation known as Graphic Reports to carry out the property inspection and a report from that organisation was provided to the plaintiffs in due course. The second page of that report (Exhibit B to the affidavit of the plaintiff) showed that Facility Solutions Australia Proprietary Limited which had a particular builders consultants license actually carried out the report and the person doing the work was the defendant, Mr Winn.

17The report that was obtained was clearly a report of Graphic Reports, because it had that name on the outside. Furthermore, there was an invoice from Graphic Reports (Ex D2) addressed to the two plaintiffs seeking a total of $418.00 for a pest report and a building report. The invoice states that the building inspection was carried out by Facility Solutions Pty Ltd and the charge for this report was $220.00. There can be no doubt that this bill was paid and equally, in my opinion, despite the evidence of the first plaintiff, that the first plaintiff was aware the services were carried out by Facility Solutions, on behalf of Graphic Reports. She knew the actual person conducting the inspection was Mr Winn, the defendant.

18It was commonly agreed by the parties that the report to be prepared by Mr Winn required him to comply with the provisions of Australian standard 4349.1 - 1995. It was also agreed that Graphic Reports was asked to do a standard inspection. The Australian standard deals with the standard property inspection and a special purpose property inspection.

19The inspection report sent to the plaintiffs was a standard property report which is defined in Clause 3.3 of Section 3 of the standard, namely ""not be seen as an all encompassing report dealing with the building from every aspect. Rather it should be seen as a reasonable attempt to identify any significant defects visible at the time of the inspection. Whether or not a defect should be regarded as significant, depends to a large extent upon the age and type of building being inspected.""

20There is further provision in the same clause (3.3) for what should be included in such a report, namely:""(a) A statement of who requested the report and the purpose for which it was requested or is intended.(b) The date or dates of inspection.(c) The scope of the inspection(d) Any area or item which was not inspected and the reasons which prevented an inspection, and if appropriate, a recommendation for further investigation.(e) A summary which includes an opinion as to the overall condition of the residential dwelling in the context of its age, type and general expectations of similar properties.(f) A list of any significant matters which requires attention or rectification.(g) If necessary, a recommendation that a further inspection or assessment be carried out by a suitably accredited specialist, e.g. pest inspector, electrical authority, water authority, structural engineer, geotechnical engineer, surveyor or solicitor"".

21And further;""The summary is possibly the most important part of the report. The important points should be extracted from the body of the report to provide the reader with a brief summary of the major faults found in the building. The summary should also put the overall condition of the building in the context of the average condition of similar buildings of approximately the same age"".

22There are some limitations and conditions. They are as follows:""3.4.1 Limitations the standard property report should not contain any assessment or an opinion in relation to-(a) any item which is the subject of a special-purpose property report. (See section 4;) (b) any area or item which was not, or could not be inspected by the consultant.(c) a matter which is not within the consultants expertise; or (d) a matter, the inspection or assessment of which is solely regulated by statute. 
3.4.2 Conditions A standard property report may be conditional upon or conditional in relation to-(a) the assessment of any apparent defect including rising damp and leaks, the detection of which may be subject to prevailing weather conditions;(b) information provided by the person, the employees or agents of the person requesting the report;(c) the specific areas of ""expertise"" of the consultant specified in the report;(d) apparent concealment possible defects; or(e) any other factor limiting the preparation of the report.""(See Ex P3, Annexure II AS4349.1-1995).""
23Mr Winn, the defendant, said in his affidavit that he did not prepare the Graphic Report. Rather, when he had carried out the inspection he sat in his car and read his notes into a Dictaphone. He identified one omission in the report as a recommendation regarding the retaining wall and dictated in the following terms:

""I recommend that an engineer be engaged to assess any structural issues, including the structural issues I have observed, such as with respect to the retaining wall.""

24He then sent the dictated notes to Graphic Reports which prepared the written report and sent it to the plaintiffs.

25Mr Winn also said that he did not see the Graphic Report until sometime in late 2012, when he received it from the plaintiff's solicitors at the time he had been served with the statement of claim. I accept the evidence of the defendant as being truthful and honest. I accept that he dictated a report but did not prepare the report any further than this.

26He did carry out his inspection by attending the property and inspecting it for about one hour. Neither of the plaintiffs was present, but the owner of the property (the vendor to the plaintiffs) was present and gave him access to it.

27The plaintiff in her affidavit said that she read the report when she received it and she contacted her real estate agent, asking him to arrange for a meeting with Mr Winn. That was agreed to a short time after and she and her de facto husband together with the agent met Mr Winn on the site. She had a copy of the report in her hand and at no time did Mr Winn refer to Facility Solutions.

28She also said that there was a second meeting on the site, attended by her father and Mr Winn.

29There is a dispute between the plaintiff and Mr Winn in evidence concerning the number of meetings between them and who was present. Mr Winn when he gave evidence, said there was one meeting only and it was attended by the plaintiff, her father, the real estate agent and himself. He denied attending another meeting. I prefer the evidence of the defendant on this matter. He gave evidence in a calm and considered manner and impressed me as being a witness of truth.

30I accept that there was one meeting only and the first plaintiff and her father attended it with the defendant 

31The first plaintiff, on the other hand, was an aggressive and at times abusive witness. During an early part of her evidence, I had to remind her that I was a Judge and that she should behave towards me in a courteous fashion (See 25/2/14 T36.50-T37.04).

32The report actually sent to her (Ex D1) was shown to her in cross-examination. The plaintiff identified her writing on the report by saying: ""That's my writing. How did the other side get this?"" (See 25/2/14 T33.47 & T34.08). This was another instance of her rude and offensive conduct.

33Towards the end of the hearing, while Senior Counsel for the defendant was addressing, she interrupted him from the back of the Court and followed this up by directed crude language towards him. I excluded her from the court (See 25.2.14 T200.28-T200.46).

34I formed the opinion that she was by nature a bully, hard to control and contemptuous of authority. I was not prepared to accept her evidence where it conflicted with that of the defendant, nor was I able to accept that she suffered 'mental harm"", for which there was no real evidence.

35The first plaintiff said that she and her father before the meeting (which she claimed was the second meeting), made notes of questions to ask the defendant and of some of his answers. Some of this was written on two sheets of paper, (although she claimed that the defendant's answers were not written on the two pages of notes during the meeting, but rather, later on). She also wrote notes on the Graphic Reports report, which she had in her possession at the time of this inspection. What was written on the report during this inspection was written entirely by her. It is clear to me that she wrote on the report during this inspection because the notes raise questions and contain answers. For example there is a question ""explain and cost to fix"" (against information in the report about door handles needing adjustment) and ""explain? -What needs to be done? , How much?"" Against an entry about the state of the windows. Her father wrote some entries on the two sheets of paper to which I have already referred.

36She claimed that the other plaintiff was present at both meetings and her father was present at the second meeting. The second plaintiff was in court but gave no evidence. The only explanation for his not giving evidence was that he had not made an affidavit (See 25.2.14 T35.47-36.04). Her father was not called as a witness and her only explanation for not calling him was that she had had no contact with her father since 2010. My conclusion was that neither of these persons would have assisted the plaintiff's case if they were called.

37She gave evidence that during the first inspection she told Mr Winn that they wanted to move in after settlement. She said that they went through the report and at one stage looked at the back brickwork retaining wall for the garden area and in particular, at a bow in the wall. Mr Winn, according to the plaintiff, said: ""It looks like its been there for a while, but if you're concerned about it get a structural engineer to look at it, but they are expensive""

38She went on to say in her affidavit (Ex P3 para 24)""In light of Mr Winn's advice, I didn't consider it to be a serious concern and wasn't worried about it"". She also said that Mr Winn did not change anything in his report nor did he give her a business card.

39She was cross-examined about this question of inspections and persisted in claiming that there were two inspections, not one. She was asked in particular about a note against item 1 in her two-page list in these words: ""we to get a quote"" and claimed that this was written in after she had moved into the house. In her affidavit, she claimed that everything written on this document was put there by her or her father after work was carried out following settlement of the house. Assuming this to have been what occurred, then it would seem quite clear that the plaintiff prepared a list seeking the answer to various questions and that her meeting with Mr Winn was to enable those questions to be answered. My reading of the notes that she placed on the report that she had in her possession indicate to me that many of the questions she had were in fact answered during this meeting.

40It was also put to her in cross examination that Mr Winn had pointed out that she needed to get an engineer but her response to this question was that he only told her to do this once. He did not repeatedly tell her that she needed an engineer. When it was put to her that this was an important matter, she replied by saying: ""it's all lies"" (See 25/2/14 T38.07-38.46). I found this a very unsatisfactory answer.

41It may well be that the list was written out in advance and the answers and other notes were put on after she had taken up occupation of the house. Some of the notes were put on by her father and he was not present to give evidence in court. I find it difficult to accept that her father put on notes at some time later than the meeting. It is possible it could have happened, but it would seem to me quite unlikely.

42The first plaintiff in her affidavit claimed that following the meeting, her de facto husband and she calculated the cost of work to be carried out and approached the real estate agent to reduce the asking price of the property, seeking a reduction in price from $325,000-$310,000. Ultimately the vendor reduced the price to $318,000 and there was an exchange of contracts on 5 September 2006.

43Thus, it is clear that the first plaintiff, as a result of discussions with the defendant, whether at one meeting or two meetings, worked out that there were defects that had to be fixed up and that this would give her the opportunity of buying the property for a lower price, something that was to her advantage. She also clearly decided, notwithstanding advice that she might need to consult a structural engineer, to go ahead with the purchase without consulting a structural engineer. The other important matter to be noted is that the property was purchased during a time that the area was dry, the house was on a very steep block and the inspection report dealt with what Mr Winn saw at the time he inspected the property. He did not purport to express an opinion about what might happen if heavy rain fell. 

44The plaintiff did not notice any defects until April 2007. On the weekend following Anzac Day in that year she noticed more cracks in the concrete floor near the per gala and water seepage coming through a sidewall. There had been very heavy rain just before this.

The Defendant's case

45Mr Winn also made an affidavit and set out in the affidavit what he did to prepare a report. He made it plain that he did not in fact make out the report that was sent to the plaintiff. Rather he carried out his inspection and dictated from handwritten notes into a Dictaphone and sent off this material to Graphic Reports. He saw the report that was sent to her only subsequently, as I have already said.

46When he dictated his report, he included in the report an observation in the following terms: ""I recommend that an engineer be engaged to assess any structural issues, including the structural issues I have observed, such as with respect to the retaining wall."" When he looked at the report at the time when given to him, it was obvious to him that this observation was not included in it. However, he did when talking about this wall, as I have already mentioned, suggest that the advice of a structural engineer should be obtained. The first plaintiff agreed he did give that advice.

47He also said on affidavit that he had one site attendance only with the plaintiff and that was in the presence of the real estate agent and also the plaintiff's father. He thought it most likely to have been the Saturday following the date of the report (26 August 2006) or the Saturday after that. He cannot remember ever meeting the second plaintiff.

48At this meeting, he could not recall the first plaintiff saying she wanted to move in immediately after settlement. Her father however wanted to clarify a few matters including the condition of the timber decking. He also wanted to look under the house, which all of them did. Mr Winn highlighted some issues under the house, specifically that there had been rectification to brickwork under the house which was cracking and had been patched. He also discussed some missing piers which had been replaced with steel columns that appeared to him to be adequate and he also indicated there was some old dry rot around the shower area.

49 In relation to the structural integrity of the retaining wall, he said that he gave advice on the following terms: ""the wall has been there for a while. There is some movement and cracking, so I recommend that you get an engineer to inspect and do a report. It will be expensive though. I'm not a qualified engineer so I can't advise you further."" He denied suggesting to her that she should only get an engineer if she were concerned. He could not recall the first plaintiff having a handwritten list with her at the time of the meeting and did not receive a copy of the list.

50He gave an extensive response, he said, to complaints made by the plaintiff about cracks and defects and pointed out (Ex D3 para 46) that he noted the presence of cracks, ill-fitting doors, old water damage and various other items to which reference was made. He did not note excess water overflow from guttering because there was no rain at the time and this was not observed. As far as complaints about the electricity attachment were concerned, he pointed out that the installation of electricity appeared to be adequate but a qualified electrician should be consulted. He also recommended a plumber and drainer be consulted.

51When he gave oral evidence he referred to the standard and the fact that he was doing a report in accordance with the standard. In my opinion he was correct in what he said.

52Much of his cross- examination was concerned with pressing him about opinions expressed by Mr Dickinson, another building consultant, who was asked in May 2007, to "" carry out a site inspection to assess building defects and deficiencies and prepare a detailed report in connection with an existing residence 21 Alison Road, Springfield.""

53It suffices to say that he, the defendant, does not agree with the reports of Mr Dickinson, nor with his opinions. Mr Dickinson assessed the property after a period of very heavy rain and expressed the opinion that the defects he discovered should have been discoverable by the defendant when he did his report. I accept the evidence of the defendant and of Mr Ransley, another building consultant that Mr Dickinson was wrong in his opinions. What Mr Dickinson was saying was that he could say from his inspection of damage occurring after very heavy rain, that this should have been apparent a year before when conditions were very dry and the damage was scarcely noticeable.

54I listened very attentively to Mr Dickinson's evidence. It was clear to me that he did a very detailed report, far beyond that envisaged for a standard inspection. He carried out detailed measurements and investigated matters far beyond what was required for a standard inspection carried out in accordance with the Australian Standard. What he produced was in fact a special purpose report.

55I would accept that much of the damage Mr Dickinson saw was caused by very heavy rain and the ingress of water onto the property from neighbouring properties as well as from the street above the property. The standard inspection did not require forecasts to be made of potential future damage from water, tree collapse, storm damage or any other source. What was required was a visual inspection and the expression of an opinion based on the visual inspection.

56I do not accept that Mr Winn, one year before very heavy rain occurred, should have been able to forecast the likely extent of damage to the house. I reject Mr Dickinson's opinion.

57I accept the opinion of the defendant and the opinion of Mr Ransley. To the extent that Mr Dickinson's opinion differs from Mr Winn, I prefer the opinion of Mr Winn because it was based on the requirements of the standard.

Conclusions on the evidence in the case

1. Breach of contract and/or negligent misstatement

58In my opinion, the inspection carried out by Mr Winn complied with the Standard. He expressed a qualification in his report to Graphic Reports, that was not put in the written report submitted to the plaintiff. He cannot be blamed for that. His duty was to carry out an inspection complying with the Standard and to submit it to Graphic Reports. He complied with that duty.

59Separately from his carrying out of this duty, he agreed to go to the site one or two weeks afterwards and to discuss his findings with the first plaintiff, her father and the real estate agent. He did this, but on one occasion only. He made her aware of the need to get engineering advice, plumbing and draining advice and advice from an electrician. He could do no more than give the advice. In the written report, he made it plain that a number of matters might require further advice from other skilled persons. The first plaintiff obviously questioned him closely. Her notes on the report indicate that and she concluded that she would need to spend money to rectify various defects. 

60She decided to use the information conveyed to her to bargain with the vendor to reduce the price, rather than to decide not to go ahead with the purchase.

61The defendant did not give her negligent advice. He was not in breach of any duty of care to her in preparing the substance of the report, nor in speaking to her later on the site.

62The claim against the defendant based on contract fails because there was no contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant. He was not guilty of making any negligent misstatement to the plaintiffs and the claim against him on that basis also fails.

63Further, I also find that the plaintiffs did not enter into the contract to purchase the property relying on what was in the Graphic Reports report. Clearly they decided to go ahead:

Because of their acceptance of the presence of defects as disclosed in the Report,In the knowledge of further advice from the defendant, rejected by them, about the need to get expert opinion on engineering, plumbing, draining and electrical matters, and Having considered the answers given by the defendant to a series of questions raised by the first plaintiff and her father andBecause the first plaintiff could use the defects to bargain down the price of the property.
64The first plaintiff was sure she could get a bargain in this property and that was her main motivation in going ahead with the purchase.

Damages

65In my opinion, there is no causal link between any statement or misstatement of the defendant and any loss suffered by the plaintiffs. The evidence does not establish that the price received by the plaintiffs on resale of the house was diminished because of anything said by the defendant. If the house was damaged by rain and flood, that damage was not caused by the defendant giving a report or commenting on it. Furthermore, no evidence was given to establish that the lesser price received was due to damage to the house.

2. Mental Harm

66There was no evidence of the plaintiff suffering any ""mental harm"" caused by the plaintiff. Indeed, there is no evidence she suffered any mental harm at all that could possibly be compensable in these proceedings. She may have suffered some stress, but that would not entitle her to recover damages from the defendant. She cannot show he did anything to cause her stress or any form of mental injury. 

67I do not accept the plaintiff as a reliable and honest witness. I accept the evidence of the defendant in preference to that of the plaintiff wherever there is a contradiction between them.

68I find a verdict for the defendant.

		03 July 2014",2014-04-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763663,Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Springer [2014] NSWCCA 52,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 13 May 2009 Patrick Springer was the respondent in this Court in proceedings brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the 2009 Proceedings). In the 2009 Proceedings the Director appealed against the sentence imposed on the offender by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Springer v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 289; (2007) 177 A Crim R 13 (the 2007 Decision). The 2007 Decision reduced Mr Springer's original sentence, which had been imposed by Bennett DCJ in the District Court, because of his undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement agencies. The ground of appeal in the 2009 Proceedings was Mr Springer's subsequent failure to comply with his undertaking.

2Mr Springer did not appear before this Court in the 2009 Proceedings but the Court was satisfied that it was appropriate to proceed in his absence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 14A; Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 68, referred to in R v Springer [2009] NSWCCA 144 at [2]-[3]. 

3On 25 May 2009 the Court handed down judgment (R v Springer [2009] NSWCCA 144) (the 2009 Decision), pursuant to which Mr Springer was sentenced as follows:

""(1) Appeal against the sentence imposed on the respondent by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 October 2007 allowed.

(2) Substitute for the non-parole period set by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 October 2007 a non-parole period of three years eight months.

(3) The head sentence of four years six months imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 October 2007 confirmed.""

4At the time the orders in the 2009 Decision were made, Mr Springer had been in prison for the relevant offence from 16 December 2005 to 15 September 2008. Therefore, as a result of the 2009 Decision, at the time of making the orders in the 2009 Decision, Mr Springer had 11 months of the non parole period and 1 year and 9 months of the parole period remaining to serve.

5Because the offender was not before the Court at the time of re-sentencing in the 2009 Proceedings, the Court declined to specify a commencement date for the sentence, pursuant to s 14A(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act. A warrant was issued for Mr Springer's arrest pursuant to the 2009 Decision.

6Mr Springer was arrested and yesterday returned to Australia in custody. The offender now being before the Court, the Court may specify a commencement date for the sentence: s 14A(2) Criminal Appeal Act. In so doing, the sentence will be deemed to commence today unless the Court directs that it commence on an earlier day, taking into account time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 47(3) and Criminal Appeal Act, s 14A(3).

7The Court has been informed that Mr Springer was detained pursuant to the warrant issued by this Court and has been in custody since 27 May 2013; that is for 10 months and 15 days. Taking into account Mr Springer's detention both in Cambodia and earlier from 16 December 2005 to 15 September 2008, Mr Springer has been in custody for 3 years 7 months and 15 days. The commencement date of the sentence should reflect this period of imprisonment.

8The Court makes the following order:

(1) The sentence imposed by this Court on 25 May 2009 of imprisonment for four years six months, with a non-parole period of three years eight months, be taken to have commenced on 27 August 2010.

(2) The earliest date on which the offender will be eligible for release is 26 April 2014.

2763670,R v Lutu [2014] NSWSC 413,"Judgment
1The offender was arraigned before me on 14 March 2014 on the charge of murdering his wife Salaseini Batirau on Sunday 20th January 2013.  From the day he committed it, he has admitted responsibility for the crime.  He indicated he would enter a plea of guilty at the first opportunity available to him when the matter was before the Local Court.
2My task today is to sentence him for this offence.
3The facts relevant to the offending have been agreed between the Crown and the offender and my findings for the purpose of sentencing will be based on them.
4In summary, the offender murdered Ms Batirau by stabbing her repeatedly in the neck and chest during a domestic argument.  Their three children were at home and witnessed the attack.  




The marital relationship
5The offender and Ms Batirau were both from Fiji. The offender was born and raised on the fire walking island of Beqa (pronounced Benga).  He and his wife met when she was posted there to work as a nurse.  They formed their relationship there, and migrated to Australia about six years ago to reunite with Ms Batirau's family, who had migrated earlier.
6Ms Batirau came here first with the idea of requalifying as a nurse in this country.  That did not occur, but the offender and their two elder children came here to join her some time later.  The youngest child was born here.  Both the offender and Ms Batirau naturalised as Australian citizens when eligible.
7After the family was reunited, the offender found work in a pet food factory and Ms Batirau stayed home to look after the children and their rented house.
8As is common, their relationship was not all smooth sailing.  There were disagreements and arguments. It is an agreed fact that there was a history of domestic violence, and the offender had been subject to an AVO for 12 months after he was convicted of assaulting Ms Batirau in 2008. 
9The facts of the 2008 assault are in evidence.  In Fiji the family had attended the same church, but in Australia Ms Batirau joined a different church and the offender disapproved.  On Mother's day 2008, Ms Batirau suggested that they all attend her church together as a family. It was closer than the offender's church.  The offender would not agree and they argued about it.  The offender became angry.  He kicked a TV unit, breaking the glass, and punched Ms Batirau to the left side of her head.  The offender then grabbed Ms. Batirau by the collar of her jumper and threatened her with his clenched right fist.  Ms. Batirau was afraid the offender would strike her again, but he did not.  Instead he yelled that she should go to work and make the money.  The couple's then two children came into the room, the younger one crying.  On seeing them the offender let Ms Batirau go.  She fled from the house with her younger child down the street to her Pastor's house,who called the police.
10The offender pleaded guilty to common assault and malicious damage to property.  He was convicted in the Campbelltown Local Court on 5th September 2008 and a good behaviour bond of 12 months duration was imposed concurrently in respect of each offence.  These matters constitute the offender's prior criminal record.  There is no other offending of any sort.
11Ms Batirau's statement about the offending of 11th May 2008 was tendered.  Some of what Ms Batirau said implies that the offender had struck her on other occasions.  She said (at [4]):
I have seen this look before and when he gets it he hits me.
She also said (at [6]), after the offender had grabbed her collar:
He tried to pull me into the kitchen and I know what happen(s) next.
And (at [7]):
When he is in this mood, I am scared and I wish I was an earthworm to b(u)rrow away from him.
12This evidence, which I accept, does not enable me to make any finding beyond reasonable doubt about the nature and extent of the incidents of violence making up that history of domestic violence.  There is no suggestion of any separation or any complete breakdown in their relationship.  Their third child was born after the 2008 incident. There is no evidence that the offender ever breached the AVO, nor is there evidence of any violence after it expired. From the history received by psychiatrists who examined the offender for these proceedings it is clear that by January 2013 the marriage was not happy.
13The offender was made redundant from his job in about October 2012.  I infer that because of his age and his language difficulties, he speaks Fijian, and his English is very poor, he was unable to find other work.  I infer that these circumstances necessitated the family moving house which occurred the day before the murder. 
14Since the offender had lost his job he and Ms Batirau frequently quarrelled about money.  When he could not find work they tried to alternate with Ms Batirau working and the offender staying home to care for the children.  Ms Batirau found a job and took over as breadwinner and provider. When this change occurred, they went to Centrelink to apply for the parenting payment to be made to the offender, but Centrelink refused and continued to pay it to Ms Batirau.  The change in their relationship seems to have created resentment on both sides.  
The events of Sunday 20th January 2013
15Ms Batirau worked on Sunday, 20th January 2013 and the offender stayed home with the children.  Ms Batirau had given the offender money to buy bread of a certain type, which she preferred.  The offender bought different bread because the shop which sold Ms Batirau's preferred style was closed. The offender and Ms Batirau had spoken on the telephone during the day.  From that conversation Ms Batirau formed the impression that the offender had purchased the bread she wanted, but when she came home after work to have her tea she was disappointed that he had bought the wrong bread, and said so.  An argument developed about the shopping and the change.  She accused the offender of lying on the phone about where he bought the bread.  She called him a liar.  He denied it.
16In his account to others, but not initially to the police, the offender says that Ms Batirau, in Fijian, called him the son of an animal or pig, a very humiliating insult in their culture, according to other evidence which I accept.  He lost his temper and stood up to hit her with the chair he had been sitting on.  Ms Batirau grabbed the chair and offender regained his control somewhat and sat down again.  However, the argument continued.    
17When Ms Batirau demanded the change from the shopping, the offender went to fetch it. When he returned he saw that his wife was still very angry with him.  He formed the impression that she was going to leave him because he had overhead her telling the children to change their clothes because she was taking them out to buy dinner and report the offender to the police. I interpolare , it is not clear what Ms Batirau had to report to the police except perhaps the attempted assault with the chair.  
18The offender challenged his wife about what she had said to the children, but she denied saying she was going to the police.  This time he did not believe her.   The offender became very angry and went to the kitchen taking a long-bladed knife from a container.    
19When interviewed by police later, he was asked:  
Q. You took the knife to frighten her or kill her?
A. I took it and stabbed her.
He said they were both very angry and when she saw the knife she stood up to stop him.  He was unable, or unwilling, to answer any further questions about his intentions in stabbing his wife.  He said he had expected her to calm down when he desisted from threatening her with the chair, but she did not.
20He told the police that he believed that Ms Batirau was about to leave him with the children and this would bring their relationship to an end.  He also believed that she was going to make some complaint about him to the police, possibly about him threatening her with the chair given his previous conviction.
21A forensic pathologist, Dr M Orde, conducted a post mortem examination on 23rd January 2013.  He found and recorded evidence of three incised wounds to the head; six incised wounds to the neck; five penetrating incised wounds to the torso; and four superficial wounds to the torso.  Multiple incised injuries were found on Ms Batirau's left arm consistent with what are described as ""defence injuries"".  These injuries included the severing of a major artery crossing the left wrist.  Dr Orde expressed the opinion that Ms Batirau died as a result of the many stab wounds penetrating her body injuring her heart, lungs, diaphragm, liver and windpipe.  
22I repeat, the attack occurred whilst the children were present in the home watching television.  They witnessed the attack.  The older children ran outside raising the alarm with neighbours who called emergency services.  
23After his attack the offender washed the knife and his hands.  He wrapped his wife in a rug in the living room.  He changed his clothes and called his uncle to ask him to come to look after the children as he had done ""something wrong"" to his wife.  He then went outside cuddled his children before going back inside to wait for the police.
24The police arrived at about 5:20 pm. They found Ms Batirau's body in the rug.  Their attempts to revive her were unsuccessful.  The offender was arrested, taken to Macquarie Field Police Station, and charged. With the assistance of a Fijian speaking member of the community, he agreed to participate in the electronically recorded interview to which I referred earlier. 



Victim impact statements
25As I have said, Ms Batirau was the mother of three children and other members of her family live in Australia.  I have had the benefit of hearing two victim impact statements read to the Court; one from her mother, Mrs Levenia Vunakece and the other by her younger brother, Abraham Vunakece.  I have no doubt that Ms Batirau was much loved by her family and is sorely missed by them.
26Mrs Vunakece said that her whole world came crumbling down when she learnt of her daughter's death.  Notwithstanding her great loss, she sounds exceptionally stoic, and has rallied her spirit for the sake of her grandchildren.  She finds it heartbreaking to consider the effect of the murder of their mother on them.  
27Ms Batirau's brother had to give up a well-paid mining job in the Northern Territory to come home to assist his mother with caring for his sister's children.  He feels his hopes and dreams have been dashed.  However, he says that his ""spirit and faith have kept him strong, and focused on helping the children heal, be loved and educated with freedom to grow"".  His carefree, single life has changed as he has assumed the responsibility of caring for his sister's children.
28I was greatly impressed by these family members and very moved by their accounts.
29Of course, the family victims most grievously affected by this murder are the children.  Notwithstanding the love, care and support of their extended family, their father has consigned them to a life as orphans.  One can only hope that each of them will overcome this bitter legacy. 
30As is now generally well-known, it is not permissible for me to extend the sentence otherwise appropriate for this offence and this offender by reference to the impact of the crime on others:  R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. Serious crimes are committed against the community at large and it is the community which is entitled to exact retribution and impose punishment:  R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [30] per Dunford J.
Subjective circumstances
31As I have already said, the offender was born and raised in a village on the island of Dequa in Fiji.  He was aged 47 years at the time of his offending, and now nearly 48 years and 6 months.
32He was the sixth of eight children of a subsistence farmer and his wife.  He had a normal, happy childhood and was educated to primary school level.  After leaving school he worked on the family farm , and performed some building work in the village.  
33I have already recounted how the offender and Ms Batirau met, the family settled in Australia, and he obtained process work.  He worked full time in this job and was the sole breadwinner for his family until October 2012 when he was made redundant.
34I have already said that after the offender's redundancy, he and his wife exchanged roles leading to tensions in the relationship.  His age and his poor English worked against him finding new employment.  I have the impression that he was unable to cope with his financial dependency upon his wife.  
35I have had the benefit of reading two psychiatric reports, the contents of which I accept.  The first is from Dr Olav Nielssen, dated 1st November 2013, and the second from Dr Richard Furst, dated 8th of January 2014.  From them it is clear that the offender does not suffer from any psychiatric or mental illness which may explain his offending.  Dr Furst expressed the view, however, that he suffered from ""adjustment issues"" following his redundancy. He stops short of diagnosing an adjustment disorder.  Dr Nielssen referred to the offender's despondency following his retrenchment and his wife's progression into the role as breadwinner and controller of the family finances.
36Apart from the incident of domestic violence I have referred to, the offender has no criminal record. 
37He was an occasional user of alcohol and traditional kava but there is no history of alcohol or other substance abuse.  There is no suggestion he was in any way intoxicated at the time of the offending. 
38The offender appears to have been a conscientious father and provider to his children.
39I again record that from the outset he acknowledged responsibility for killing his wife, co-operated with police, and gave a fairly full account to them when interviewed. I repeat, the offender indicated his intention to plead guilty at the earliest possible opportunity.
Facts in dispute
40The parties are in dispute about the following matters:
(a)Is the offending aggravated by the consideration that he acted in response to a belief that his wife was going to report some other crime committed by him to the police?
(b)Has he genuinely shown remorse?
(c)Is there a degree of provocation, not as a partial defence, but by way of mitigation for the purpose of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing and Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act)?
(d)Is the effect of his early plea diminished by consideration of the strength of the Crown case?
(e)Has the offender established special circumstances for the adjustment of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term?
I think it appropriate to deal with these matters as I refer to the factors relevant to fixing the appropriate sentence in this case.  In doing so, I bear in mind that aggravating factors need to be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt, and mitigating factors by the offender on the balance of probabilities.  
Factors relevant to sentencing in this case
41I am required to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence (s.61 Sentencing Act).  Bad as this offending is, I am satisfied that it does not fall into that very extreme category, and it was not suggested by the Crown that it did.  I can move on from this consideration.
42Even so, it remains important to bear in mind that life imprisonment is the maximum punishment for the crime of murder: s 19A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  However, I am authorised by law to impose a sentence of imprisonment for murder for a specified term: s 21 Sentencing Act.  Murder is also an offence for which Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period, in this case, of 20 years (Division 1A Sentencing Act).  The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period provide important guideposts in fixing the appropriate penalty.
43The nature of the sentencing task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender, having regard to all relevant facts, matters and circumstances.  A sentence must fit the offending, having regard to its objective seriousness; that is the offender must be adequately punished for his offending.  At the same time, a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the crime.
44As is often said, after treason, murder is the most serious offence known to our law.  It must always be viewed as an objectively serious crime.  However, an assessment of all the circumstances informing the objective seriousness of the particular offending must be made as that evaluation is relevant in assessing the degree of moral culpability involved.
45As the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage, he is legally entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, because of the utilitarian value of his early plea.  The value of that plea is somewhat in dispute, as I have already indicated, and I will return to this question.
46It goes without saying, that in any case of murder no penalty other than a long period of imprisonment is appropriate.  As this is not a very extreme case of murder, I will impose a sentence for a specified period of years, which will also legally require me to fix a non-parole period.  The non-parole period is the minimum period of time that justice requires the offender to serve in prison.  Unless I find special circumstances, by law the additional term during which the offender may be eligible for parole must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period.   It should not be assumed, however, that an offender is automatically released on the first day on which he is eligible for parole.  Again by law, an investigative process is undertaken by the executive branch of government, not the Court, to determine whether a given offender should in fact be released on parole.
47Sentencing is not a purely logical exercise. Its purposes are various, overlapping and competing. They include the protection of society; retribution and denunciation; general and specific deterrence; and reform and rehabilitation: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14 164 CLR 465; s3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW). And increasingly, the recognition of the harm done to victims and the community.
Objective seriousness of the offending
48In the present case, it is agreed that the offender repeatedly stabbed Ms Batirau with the intention of killing her.  His intention was not simply to inflict serious personal injury.  From the number of wounds; the defensive injuries suffered by Ms Batirau; and what the offender told the police about her struggle, Ms Batirau would have been aware of what was happening to her. Doubtless she survived long enough to suffer very significantly.  This is not a case of a single fatal blow struck in anger during an argument.  This was a sustained attack with a knife upon an unarmed victim, whom the offender was bound to protect.
49The fact that the offence was committed in the presence of the children significantly aggravates the seriousness of the offence (s 21A(2)(ea) Sentencing Act).  All offences committed in the presence of children are regarded as aggravated because of the deleterious effect the offence will have on the emotional and moral wellbeing of a child.  This effect is worse where, as here, the offender is the child's parent: Gore v R; Hunter v R (2010) 208 A Crim R 353; [2010] NSWCCA 330 at [104].  
50This offence is also aggravated by the consideration that it is a severe example of domestic violence.  Violent offences committed in the home or in a domestic relationship, should not be tolerated in our society.  I recognise the need for the public to be protected from the commission of such crimes.  Violence by men against women in our society calls for particular denunciation.  General deterrence of violence against women in our society then must figure in sentencing for this crime.  Specific deterrence of the offender is also a factor given the past conviction. But perhaps of slightly lesser significance given other circumstances discussed later.  
51The Crown submitted that the offender's actions were in part motivated by a concern that the deceased was going to report his threats of violence with the chair to the police and I have found this played some part in what happened given what he thought he overheard. The Crown submits this is an aggravating feature because it demonstrates a motive to murder in order to conceal another offence. 
52To be satisfied of this I would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Lutu murdered his wife in order to conceal his assault upon her. The offender has consistently maintained that the murder arose out of an argument as to groceries and finances, and that he killed his wife as he was afraid she would take the children away from him. From his interview with police immediately after his arrest I am of the view that he was confused and unable to articulate any motive for his actions beyond his fears of losing his children. While he admitted to police that he did not want the deceased to report him to them this was again due to his fears of losing the children. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he murdered his wife to conceal threatening her with the chair. Concealment implies some premeditation which is absent here, as the Crown accept. This was a sudden crime of passion.
53Moreover concealment of a lesser crime is inconsistent with his acceptance of responsibility for murder.
54The circumstances I have accepted demonstrate that this is a serious example of murder in a domestic relationship. The offender's moral culpability is high.
Mitigating Factors
55As I have repeatedly explained the offender is entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise be imposed because he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity; s 21A(3)(k) and s22 Sentencing Act.  This is because of the utilitarian value of the plea.  Contrary to the Crown's argument in the present case, this utilitarian value is not reduced to take into account the strength of the prosecution case as a factor inducing the plea: R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1; [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32]).  Nor is there any component in this discount for remorse.  In due course, I will allow the offender the usual discount for a plea entered at the first available opportunity of 25 per cent.  
56I turn then to the consideration of remorse.  The Crown argued that I should not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender is remorseful.  At best the evidence, such as it is, was said to be equally consistent with him feeling sorry for himself and regretting his present circumstances.  I am not persuaded by this argument.  It seems to me on the evidence that he accepted responsibility for his crime immediately, and in my view, this is relevant to remorse.  He rang his uncle and informed him that he had done something bad to his wife.  He cuddled his children, I infer to comfort them and say goodbye.  He did not ring the police, but I accept this was because of his bad English.  He clearly knew they were going to be called.  When they arrived he did not try to hide what had happened, and, in my judgment, co-operated fully with them in the interview process even if he could not fully articulate the number of times he stabbed Ms Batirau.  As I have said, I think there were difficulties with communication.  The interpreter provided was not a trained, skilled, official interpreter but an ordinary member of the community doing his best to help.
57He expressed remorse to Dr Furst.  In my view, it is not to the point that Dr Furst refers to this as ""some remorse"" at one point in his report. In his conclusions Dr Furst did not so qualify it.  The offender said that he was sorry for what he did.  He described it as an accident.  In using this expression he was not downplaying his responsibility for a dreadful crime.  Rather, as I heard during the proceedings on sentence, the word translated from Fijian into English as ""accident"" does not carry the English meaning of an untoward, unlooked for, or unintended event. It simply means an event that was not planned.  I accept this explanation.  Moreover, I have found, as the Crown also accept, that the offence was not planned nor premeditated.  
58An affidavit by the offender's uncle was read.  He said that the offender said to him ""uncle, can you come and look after the children, I have accidentally done something to [Ms Batirau]"".
59The translation of a letter, and it's Fijian original, from the offender was tendered.  In his letter, the offender refers to his wife as his ""beloved"" and ""the mother of his children"".  He said ""I do not want to do to my wife anything such as happened that day"".  He asked for forgiveness from his children and from all who were present in Court at the time of the proceedings on sentence.  He asked the Court to forgive him.  
60Of course, forgiveness is beyond the power of the Court.  But I took those statements together with the other evidence I have referred to, on the balance of probabilities, as evidence of the genuine expression of remorse on the part of the offender.
61It was argued on behalf of the offender that he was provoked by Ms Baitrau's insult.  Although not mentioned to the police, I accept the evidence of the offender's uncle that the offender told him about the insult.  I am not persuaded that what is said about the insult is a recent invention.  On the balance of probabilities, I accept that it was said and I accept the evidence of the uncle that in Fijian culture, such a statement is very insulting because it offends the parents as well as their offspring.  I accept the statement was offensive, but I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was provocative in the statutory sense.  Rather, the explanation for what happened lies with the offender's changed circumstances and the changed dynamic of their relationship.  The previous history of some violence cannot be overlooked.  I find that the offender was not provoked by the insult.  Rather, he seems to have lost a degree of control because he felt threatened, especially in his changed circumstances, by the idea of his wife leaving him and taking the children with her.  
62That the offender was generally a person of good character is of less significance in a murder case because of the inherent seriousness of the crime of murder, but it should not be overlooked.  Moreover, I am persuaded that the offender is unlikely to re-offend.  There is no mental disorder suggesting he might be a risk to the community upon his release.  His acceptance of his guilt and his expression of remorse are genuine, as I have said.  As one might expect, having regard to his previous character, he has conducted himself well in custody and attends church services each Sunday.  I accept the opinion of Dr Furst that he has good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated. 
63Before turning then to the imposition of the sentence I consider appropriate, I should say something about the argument advanced on behalf of the offender that I should make a finding of special circumstances.  It is argued that I should find special circumstances ""because the offender will require re-adapting to society on release and a longer period of supervision would benefit both the offender and the community in light of issues identified in the psychiatrist's report"".  I am not satisfied that special circumstances have been demonstrated on this ground. I have taken the psychiatrists' views into account in mitigation of the sentence already.  Because of the length of the sentence I will impose, the statutory non-parole period is likely to provide an adequately long period of supervision for readjustment or readaptation into society if the offender is released on parole when eligible.
Comparative sentences
64To assist me in my deliberations, counsel have provided me with information about sentences passed in other murder cases in the context of domestic violence.  The Crown has provided a schedule summarising the facts and outcomes in some sixteen cases.  On behalf of the offender I was provided with a folder containing fifteen previous decisions said to be comparable.  I have read these cases and considered the other material provided.  I do not think any useful purpose is served by me setting out my impressions of this material.  In saying this, I bear in mind that what is required is consistency of principle, not numerical equivalence: Hili v R; Jones v R  [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520.  The previous decisions establish a range of sentences actually imposed, but do not establish the correctness of the range: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [303] - [305]. Nonetheless, I have borne the decisions in mind and derived some guidance from them.
Sentence imposed
65Bearing in mind all the facts, matters and circumstances to which I have referred and deriving some guidance from the cases to which counsel have taken me, but for the guilty plea, I would have imposed a sentence of 25 years on the offender for the murder of Ms Batirau.  I am required by law to allow a discount of 25%, and accordingly the term of imprisonment I will impose is one of 18 years and nine months.  As there are no special circumstances, the non-parole follows as a matter of law as 14 years and 23 days, which for administrative convenience, and to avoid an artificial appearance of precision, I will round down to 14 years.
66As the offender has been in custody since his arrest on 20th January 2013, the sentence I impose will commence on that date.
67Nacanieli Lutu, on your plea of guilty, I convict you of the murder of Salaseini Batirau.  I sentence you to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 14 years, commencing on 20th January 2013 and expiring on 19th January 2027 with an additional term of 4 years and 9 months commencing on 20th January 2027 and expiring on 19th October 2031.  
68The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 20th January 2027.**********

		10 April 2014",2014-04-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2763677,R v Tabbah; R v Tiriaki (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 566,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HER HONOUR: This is an application for an order under s 8 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010, in relation to the non-publication of photographs identifying the accused in this trial, in circumstances where it is believed that yesterday photographers took, or were attempting to take photographs of the accused while they were in handcuffs. 

2The application is made in circumstances where, from the accuseds' point of view, it is submitted that visual identification is in issue. That is disputed by the Crown which says that the CCTV images in question are not of sufficient clarity to permit such identification. That is an issue, plainly, between the parties.

3The order is pressed on the basis that publication of such photographs could, in the circumstances, prevent the accused receiving a fair trial. 

4It seems to me that, while somewhat finely balanced, the better course in the circumstances which have arisen is to make an order that no photograph identifying, or tending to identify either accused, being accompanied by members of Corrective Services staff, be published. 

5LANGE: Before the court concludes the order, I have been reminded of one thing by my instructing solicitor. Would your Honour add also, ""or if in handcuffs""? It may well be that through cropping the accused is not actually shown to be accompanied, and that would be prejudicial. 

6I am satisfied, given the issue between the parties as to visual identification of the accused, that the order in the terms pressed is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, and that is in the public interest, in order to ensure a fair trial. 

7For these reasons, I order that: 

1. No photograph identifying, or tending to identify either accused being accompanied by members of Corrective Service staff, or in handcuffs be published. The grounds on which the order is made are that I am satisfied, given the issue between the parties as to visual identification of the accused, that the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice, and that is in the public interest, in order to ensure a fair trial.

2763698,Hallak v R [2014] NSWCCA 48,"Judgment

1R A HULME J: I agree with Davies J.

2DAVIES J: The Applicant was charged with having committed a robbery in company on 19 December 2011. He pleaded guilty on the morning the trial was due to start. The co-offender had pleaded guilty ten days earlier. 

3The Applicant and the co-offender (who are brothers) were sentenced by Judge Colefax SC on 14 June 2013. The Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and two months with an additional term of one year and one month. In fixing that sentence his Honour gave a discount of 5% in respect of the plea.

4The Applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court on one ground only:

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the discount to be afforded to the applicant for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.

5It is clear from the Applicant's submissions that the discount that he says he ought to have been accorded was one of 10%.

6It is only necessary to mention the facts briefly.

7A little after 8pm on 19 December 2011 the victim, Ms Miao, a 30 year old woman, boarded a train at Cabramatta railway station to travel to Carramar. The Applicant and his brother boarded the same carriage of the train. The victim alighted at Carramar, as did the Applicant and his brother. The Applicant and his brother followed Ms Miao. 

8When she arrived at a pedestrian footbridge crossing Prospect Creek the Applicant grabbed her handbag. He took hold of her left arm in the bicep area and grabbed it with such force that she felt pain. The victim did not let go of her grip on her handbag. The Applicant's brother then put his hand around the front of her neck and squeezed so tightly that she had difficulty breathing. That caused her to release her grip on her handbag. She had in her handbag credit cards, other personal identification cards, a mobile phone, an iPod and a graduation certificate.

9The Applicant's brother looked through her handbag. The Applicant asked her if she had any money and she gave him a $10 note which she had in her pocket. She told the Applicant that he could keep everything in her handbag but she asked for her graduation certificate back. He said ""No"" and he gave the bag to his brother who then threw it with all its contents into Prospect Creek from which it has never been recovered. 

10The Applicant had a criminal record for convictions including car stealing, committing an act of cruelty on an animal, aggravated assault with intent to rob and use corporal violence. All of those offences were ones for which he had been sentenced to periods of imprisonment. The present offence was committed whilst he was on parole for the offence of aggravated assault.

11He was arrested on 8 February 2012. His parole was revoked on 16 February 2012 and he served the balance of that sentence which expired on 28 October 2012. He remained in custody after that time by reason of his arrest on the present offence. 

12The indictment was dated 18 July 2012 and the trial was fixed for 3 December 2012. As mentioned earlier, the Applicant pleaded guilty on the morning of the trial. In his Remarks on Sentence the Sentencing Judge said:

The plea of guilty was entered very late in the proceedings, in fact, on the morning of the trial. I should give Mr Mohammad Hallak a discount of 5% for the late plea.

13His Honour said later that the co-offender's plea was entered some three weeks before the trial and he proposed to give the co-offender a discount of 10%. The Crown has pointed out that in fact the co-offender's plea was made ten days before the trial. 

14At the hearing of the appeal the Applicant was represented by Mr Johnston of counsel who had come into the matter shortly before the appeal was heard and had not prepared the written submissions. 

15The written submissions directed attention to what had been said in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] and particularly to the statement that the utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10%-25% discount on sentence. It was then submitted that because the co-offender was given a discount of 10% the applicant should have been given the same discount by reason of the temporal proximity to the Applicant's plea. 

16Nowhere in the written submissions was it said how the Judge's selection of 5% amounted to error. The choice of a discount for a plea is within the discretion of a sentencing judge: Thomson at [10] and [72]. 

17In Krotiris v R [2012] NSWCCA 28 it was similarly submitted that a 5% discount for the utilitarian plea of guilty was inadequate and was less than the range referred to in Thomson. In my judgment (Macfarlan JA agreeing) I held that it was open to the sentencing judge to conclude that a 5% discount for a plea which came at a late stage was appropriate having regard to what was said in Thomson and the other authorities that I there reviewed. 

18Mr Johnston's submissions focussed on the alleged failure of the Sentencing Judge to provide adequate reasons for his conclusion that the Applicant should receive a discount of five per cent. He drew attention to what was said by Sully J (Mason P and Sperling J agreeing) in R v Johnstone [2004] NSWCCA 307 at [28]:

...[I]t seems to me to be in accord with relevant principle that a sentencing Judge who has concluded that a just discount is at the lower rather than at the higher end of the guideline range, ought to give at least a brief, clear and simple explanation of the process of reasoning that led the Judge to that conclusion.

19It should be noted, however, that Sully J had noted earlier in that paragraph that there was a ""total absence of any explanation of the decision to set the figure at 15 per cent"" rather than some other figure. Such is not the position in the present case. His Honour's reasons were pithy but sufficient. 

20I do not consider that his Honour was required to give more elaborate reasons than were provided. He made it clear that the plea was entered on the morning of the trial and that that was to be compared with the co-offender who had entered his plea at an earlier time. I do not consider that his Honour's mistaken reference to the co-offender's plea having been entered three weeks (rather than ten days) earlier is material. 

21Mr Johnston also submitted that common practice engendered an expectation that a 10% discount is given for a plea on the first day of a trial. This, Mr Johnston said, raised the prospect that the Applicant was being punished for some other unspecified behaviour because a discount of only 5% was given. Error cannot, however, be established by pointing to an expectation derived from a common practice just as error is not established simply because a judge gives a discount outside the range suggested in Thomson. 

22The range of discount referred to in Thomson is a guideline which creates no presumption nor entitlement to a particular discount to reflect the utilitarian value of an offender's plea of guilty: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at [28]; R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 113 at [12]; R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283 at [44]; and Tunivono v R [2013] NSWCCA 176 at [60].

23The Applicant's counsel did not dispute that it was appropriate to have given the co-offender a 10% discount. It may be accepted that there is a material benefit in a plea being entered even as late as ten days before a trial is due to commence. A jury panel will not need to be assembled, witnesses will not need to present, the prosecuting authorities will not need to prepare the case for trial. In that way a smaller discount for a plea made on the morning of the trial needs no more elaborate reasons than were given. The plea's utilitarian value is self-evidently less than one given ten days before the trial.

24It was not contended that the discount for the Applicant should have been more than 10%. It is difficult to see how the Applicant could make good a submission that an allowance of 5% was outside the scope of the judge's discretion: cf Sullivan v R; Skillin v R [2008] NSWCCA 296 at [14] per Howie J.

25The overall effect of increasing the discount to 10% would be to subtract three months from the overall sentence given to the Applicant. It will rarely be appropriate for this Court to intervene to adjust a sentence by that amount.

26Even had error been established, no lesser sentence than that given by the Sentencing Judge was warranted. The offence was committed with a degree of planning when the Applicant was on parole for an offence of a similar type. He was accorded some leniency by the backdating of his sentence to a date earlier than the expiry of the sentence he was serving from the prior offence after his parole had been revoked. 

27There was no point of principle that justified the present appeal being brought particularly in the light of Krotiris. In those circumstances I would propose that leave to appeal be refused.

28ADAMSON J: I agree.

2763719,Toth v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 133,"Decision Below:

Court / Tribunal: District Court

Before: Madgwick ADCJ

Date of Decision: 26 September 2013

Court File Number(s): DC 2011/20779



			Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On 23 February 2010 the applicant, Mr Andrew Toth, visited a general practitioner in Campsie. He complained of a possible hernia in his groin. Using a concealed video recorder in the shape of a pen he recorded the examination undertaken by the doctor and the conversation with her. He was later charged with an offence under s 7(1)(b) of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW), namely that he used a listening device to record a ""private conversation"" to which he was a party. The term ""private conversation"" is defined to mean ""any words spoken by one person to another person ... in circumstances that may reasonably be taken to indicate that any of those persons desires the words to be listened to only ... by themselves... but does not include a conversation made in any circumstances in which the parties to it ought reasonably to expect that it might be overheard by someone else"": s 4(1), private conversation.

2Although the activity which formed the basis of the offence was a video recording, the charge was limited to so much of that conduct as constituted an audio recording of a private conversation. The charge was heard before Magistrate Stone on 16 April 2012. The applicant was represented at the hearing. The case was defended, but the magistrate found the applicant guilty of the charge and proceeded to convict him and impose a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Procedure Act""), for a period of 18 months. The bond was imposed on 28 May 2012.

3On 25 June 2012 the applicant lodged a notice of appeal to the District Court. The effect of that notice was to stay the execution of the sentence: Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), s 63.

4The appeal was heard by Madgwick ADCJ on 20 September 2012. The applicant was again represented. The basis of the appeal was that the applicant was not guilty of the offence because that which was admittedly recorded was not a ""private conversation"" because the parties to it ought reasonably to have expected that it might be overheard. The factual foundation for the ground was some brief evidence given by the doctor to the effect that she, in her surgery, could hear conversations between persons in the reception area. It was therefore to be inferred that conversations which took place in the consulting room could be heard by persons outside in the reception area so that the prosecution could not establish that the words spoken in the consulting room constituted a ""private conversation"".

5Judge Madgwick dismissed that ground of appeal and accordingly held that the applicant was guilty of the offence charged. He did not, however, proceed to conviction but, instead, imposed a bond under s 10 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The terms of the bond varied from the terms imposed by the magistrate in two respects. First, there were minor and presently irrelevant changes to the conditions. Secondly, the period was varied so as to extend for 14 months from the date of judgment in the District Court, namely 20 September 2012. The period of the bond thus expired on 19 November 2013.

6There is no right of appeal from a judgment of the District Court on an appeal from the Local Court in a criminal matter. Further, the judgment of the District Court is protected from both appeal and review by a form of privative clause in s 176 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW). The effect of that provision is to prevent review by this Court under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), except for jurisdictional error: Downey v Acting District Court Judge Boulton (No 5) [2010] NSWCA 240; 78 NSWLR 499 at [134].

7Proceedings for judicial review of the decision of the District Court were commenced in this Court in 10 October 2013. Part 59 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), dealing with judicial review proceedings, commenced on 15 March 2013. It requires that proceedings for judicial review must be commenced within three months of the date of the decision sought to be reviewed: r 59.10(1). The Court may extend time. The present application for review was not filed until more than 12 months after the judgment in the District Court and approximately one month before the expiration of the bond. The purpose of the application was to challenge the finding of guilt of the offence. 

8The applicant was not represented in this Court, but understood that he needed to obtain an extension of time to bring the proceedings and, if successful at that stage, needed to demonstrate jurisdictional error. The errors relied upon were breach of procedural fairness and failure to take into account relevant considerations.

9In seeking an extension of time, the applicant faced three major obstacles. First, the application was not only delayed, but came too late to have any practical consequence in terms of the offending: its only purpose could be to clear from his record a finding of guilt. Secondly, apart from ignorance of the time period contained in the rules, he provided no explanation as to the delay in bringing the proceedings. Thirdly, the proceedings lacked merit.

10There is no need to expand on the first two issues noted above. The third warrants some further brief explanation.

11The applicant was represented in the District Court. His complaint of lack of procedural fairness was, in substance, that the trial judge did not take enough time in considering the matter to have properly addressed the arguments which the applicant wished to have raised on the appeal. The point raised on the appeal was a short one: it was articulated by the applicant's lawyer in written and oral submissions and the transcript of the hearing leaves no doubt that the judge was fully acquainted with the substance of the argument.

12The submissions for the applicant in this Court rely upon a common misconception. Thus, the applicant raised and relied upon his own subjective concerns as to the manner in which the appeal was disposed of. That is not the relevant test. The question is rather whether the applicant, through his legal representative, had a sufficient opportunity to present submissions as to the ground on which the finding of guilt was challenged. For that purpose, the only relevant evidence before the Court was the transcript of the hearing. That did not disclose any lack of a reasonable opportunity to present the appeal; nor did the lawyer appearing for the applicant object to the manner in which the case was heard.

13Secondly, the applicant expressed the view that the judge did not have sufficient time to consider and rule on the critical issue. However, procedural fairness is not concerned with the decision-making process in the mind of the judge.

14The complaint of a lack of procedural fairness in the District Court is not tenable.

15Thirdly, the applicant alleged a failure to take account of ""relevant considerations"". This argument was, in substance, a reformulation of the complaint as to hastiness. The issue to be assessed turned on a narrow aspect of the evidence given by the doctor as to the capacity for conversations outside the room to be heard inside the room and the inference (as to which there was no direct evidence) that a conversation between patient and doctor in the consulting room, could be heard outside in the reception area. It is clear from the transcript that this was the evidence relied upon by the applicant's lawyer and was taken into account by the trial judge in confirming the finding of guilt. 

16In oral submissions the applicant pressed the concern that the trial judge had available to him, but did not listen to, the audio recording of the conversation between the applicant and the doctor, which was the subject of the charge. That recording, the Court was informed, would have revealed that the doctor spoke in a normal voice. It is true that the judge did not listen to the audio recording, but that evidence was not critical to the finding of guilt. The doctor gave evidence from which it was clear that she wished the conversation to be private. The applicant did not give evidence. There was therefore no evidence to contradict the conclusion that both persons desired the words to be listened to only by themselves.

17There was, however, positive evidence from the doctor that she did not expect her consultation with the applicant to be overhead by others: Tcpt, 16/04/12, p 5(5). That evidence was not determinative of the question raised by the proviso, which was whether the parties ""ought reasonably"" to have expected that the conversation might be overheard. However, given that the doctor worked at the surgery, her opinion, which was led without objection, supported the conclusion that the proviso did not apply. The application of the proviso was the issue on which the appeal was based. Listening to the audio recording taken inside the consulting room would have provided little assistance in resolving that issue. The complaint that the judge did not listen to the audio recording does not identify a failure properly to exercise the jurisdiction of the court.

18The trial judge was required to have regard to the applicant's case and critical aspects of the evidence upon which he relied: there was no apparent breach of that obligation.

19In these circumstances, the application for review lacked merit; that factor, in combination with the unexplained delay and the expiration of the bond make it inappropriate to grant an extension of time. The appropriate course is to dismiss the amended summons. 

20The Director sought costs of the proceedings in this Court. Although the proceedings arose out of a trial for a summary offence, the applicant had exercised his right of appeal from his conviction without incurring liability to pay the prosecutor's costs. The present application is within the civil jurisdiction of the Court and is directed to the regularity of the proceedings in the District Court. The applicant having sought to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court unsuccessfully, the usual order, namely that costs follow the event, should apply.

21The Court should make the following orders:

(1)Dismiss the amended summons.

(2)Order that the applicant pay the Director's costs of the proceedings in this Court.

22BARRETT JA: I agree with Basten JA.

23EMMETT JA: I agree with Basten JA that an extension of time should not be granted and that the amended summons should be dismissed with costs.

2763720,Allen v Lloyd-Jones (No. 6) [2014] NSWDC 40,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiff, the Mayor of Bega, commenced proceedings for defamation on 14 April 2009 for publication by the defendant of a letter dated 7 February 2009, addressed to the Honourable Nathan Rees, at the time the Premier of New South Wales. This letter described the events leading up to, and following, the circumstances in which the Bermagui home of Mr and Mrs Campbell, indigenous Australians, had been invaded by a group of white youths in the early hours of the morning in October 2006. The plaintiff had had a meeting with Mr and Mrs Campbell as part of the community's response to the ongoing problem of racial tensions. Mr and Mrs Campbell, dissatisfied with the outcome, complained to the Ombudsman. 

2When the plaintiff saw their complaint letter, he telephoned Mrs Campbell and very shortly afterwards there was a meeting. The defendant's description of this telephone call and meeting in the 7 February 2009 matter complained of was the subject matter relevant to the plaintiff's defamation claim. 

3The 11-day hearing (""the first hearing"") commenced on 19 July 2010. On 9 May 2011, Colefax SC DCJ awarded $50,000 general damages and $15,000 aggravated damages for publications of the matter complained of to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Sydney Morning Herald and two of their journalists, as well as to the 17 members of an action group known as the Committee for Reconciliation and Justice (""the Committee"") ( added during the first hearing: T 41). 

4The circumstances in which the judgment of Colefax SC DCJ was set aside in part, and the proceedings remitted for rehearing on the issues outlined below, are set out in Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2012] NSWCA 230 at [86]-[87] and Lloyd-Jones v Allen (No 2) [2012] NSWCA 315. Leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was refused: Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2013] HCATrans 66. 

5There are two issues in this retrial: the defence of justification pleaded to two of the four imputations, and a fresh assessment of damages. There are two reasons for the reassessment of damages, as opposed to some other alternative, such as reducing the damages awarded at the first trial. The first is that the defendant's common law qualified privilege defence succeeded on appeal in relation to the publication to the 17 committee members (agreed to have been the most significant publication in terms of extent of publication and hurt to feelings). The second is that this retrial is limited to the defence of justification pleaded to two of the four imputations conveyed by the matter complained of. If the defence fails for these two imputations, damages must be reassessed on the basis of the publication to the broadcasters and journalists as the publication to the Committee was made on a protected occasion. If the defence succeeds for these two imputations, I must take this into account when assessing damages for the remaining two imputations which are not the subject of these proceedings.

6Although the letter is addressed to the Premier of New South Wales, the plaintiff has never claimed damages for publication to him. The extent of publication the subject of these proceedings is limited to the two news organisations referred to at the end of the letter, namely the ABC ""Four Corners"" programme and the Sydney Morning Herald, as well as to two journalists in those organisations, namely Sarah Curnow and Joel Gibson. There is also a claim of ""grapevine effect"".

Background

7The events the subject of the matter complained of start with the escalation in 2006 of racial tensions in the Bega Valley Shire, leading up to what has been described throughout this case as a ""home invasion"" of the dwelling house occupied by the Campbell family, residents in the Bega Valley Shire for many generations. The situation became tense in early October 2006 after unknown persons sprayed graffiti on a bridge used by young indigenous Australians for fishing, saying: ""Nigger, nigger, nigger - the KKK's getting bigger every day. You stink, so go and have a wash"" (Exhibit D). There was also a confrontation at the bridge, in which Mrs Campbell, the mother of one of the indigenous youths, had successfully intervened.

8At about 2 am on Sunday October 8, 2006 the Campbell family was awoken by over 25 intoxicated white youths coming onto their suburban home and garden, waving iron bars and shouting ""Come out you black coons, we're going to get you"" (Exhibit D). Other Bermagui residents, including the family next door, were also awakened. There were children present, and they were terrified. Mr Campbell telephoned the police. The police arrived at 3.15 am, by which time several young people had already been injured. Mrs and Mrs Campbell's teenage sons, one of whom had been taken to Moruya Hospital with serious eye injuries caused by being hit over the head with an iron bar, were charged with affray, but no charges were laid at the time against the white youths, who had been permitted by police to drive away from the scene, despite at least one driver being inebriated. 

9These events caused concern. Mr and Mrs Wells, neighbours of Mr and Mrs Campbell, arranged a meeting for them with the Mayor and Deputy Mayor at the Wells' home. This meeting was described by Mr Connell in his submissions as having been very friendly (written submissions, paragraph 2(e)). Practical assistance, such as removal of racist graffiti, was provided subsequent to this meeting.

10However, Mr and Mrs Campbell were not satisfied with the adequacy of the response to their concerns. They wrote to the NSW Ombudsman on 22 October 2006 (Exhibit D), asking why the white attackers were permitted by police to drive away despite being drunk, and why their sons had been charged before any of the white youths were interviewed or charged. Mr and Mrs Campbell asked the Ombudsman to ""look into this matter on our behalf"", adding that the Mayor and Deputy Mayor had ""initially promised their support to look into this matter however there has been no further response or action""(Exhibit D). Mr and Mrs Campbell also claimed that they had been asked at this meeting not to speak to the media ""for fear of bringing disrepute to our town's name and further fuelling the incident"" (Exhibit D). 

11This letter came to the plaintiff's attention on 26 October 2006. His evidence in the first hearing was that he was ""very, very, very, very upset"" (T 30) when he read it. He telephoned the Deputy Mayor and then drove from Bega to her home, on the outskirts of Bermagui. He told the Deputy Mayor he had come to Bermagui intending to meet with the Campbells that day. She went with him. He then drove to a petrol station in Bermagui, within sight of the Campbell home, to pick up a Mr Manns, whom the Deputy Mayor had telephoned from her home to invite, as he had prior experience as an Aboriginal liaison officer. The Deputy Mayor also invited Mr Wells, at whose home the previous meeting had taken place.

12When they picked up Mr Manns at the petrol station, the plaintiff and the Deputy Mayor suddenly realised that neither of them had rung the Campbells to arrange the meeting they had decided to have that afternoon. The plaintiff then telephoned Mrs Campbell from his car at a petrol station in Bermagui near the Campbells' home, asking Mrs Campbell if he and the Deputy Mayor, who was with him in the car, could come to her home for a ""yarn"" or a ""chat"" about their letter to the Ombudsman. 

13Whether this meeting was agreed to by Mrs Campbell during the call is disputed, as is whether or not the plaintiff asked for a meeting in the next ten minutes. It is the evidence of the phone conversation which forms the subject matter upon which issues for this rehearing concerning imputations (a) and (c) are based. Mrs Campbell said in her evidence that she did not agree to any meeting and did not want the plaintiff in her home. Mr Campbell was not home at the time, and thus not in a position to agree. The plaintiff says that Mrs Campbell replied that her husband was not home, but that he could be in half an hour, and the plaintiff agreed to wait in his car for his arrival. It is common ground that the plaintiff did not mention to Mrs Campbell that he and the Deputy Mayor intended to bring two other persons, Mr Wells and Mr Mann, to this meeting.

14When the plaintiff telephoned Mrs Campbell, Mr Campbell was still at the local school where he worked as a teacher's aide. Mrs Campbell's evidence is that she immediately rang her husband to ask him to come home early from the school where he was the homework supervisor, as the plaintiff and the Deputy Mayor wanted to have a meeting. She also telephoned the defendant and asked her to attend. Mrs Campbell's reasons for asking the defendant to attend are disputed by the plaintiff. 

15Whether by accident or because of the Campbells' reluctance to have this meeting in their home, it took place in the laneway, about half an hour after the Mayor's telephone call. Mr and Mrs Campbell, the defendant and her husband, the plaintiff, the Deputy Mayor and Mr Mann were present; Mr Wells arrived well after the meeting had started. The events of that meeting are the subject of findings in the first hearing that are adverse to the defendant and her witnesses on all issues. Accordingly, all findings of fact in relation to that issue are to be found in the judgment following the first hearing.

The matter complained of

16Any consideration of the evidence in dispute must start with a careful examination of the matter complained of. I have added numbers to the paragraphs for convenience.

17The text of the 7 February 2009 letter is as follows:

""Dear Premier,

1. I believe that a very important matter needs rigorous investigation in relation to a prevailing police culture in the Bermagui/Narooma area. A situation which I believe is duplicated throughout many regional centres in Australia.

2. Below is an in-depth commentary on one particular matter here on the far south coast of NSW and I would ask your action to further investigate the handling of this matter by the Minister of Police, the Hon. Tony Kelly MLC; and the Far South Coast Area Command in relation to the Narooma police.

3. When the Palm Island case was unfolding to the north of our land in June 2007, a case was being heard in Bega Local Court in respect to a highly regarded indigenous family, of long-standing in the Bermagui community, who were suffering, and continue to do so, because of what would appear to be a deeply concerning entrenched police culture of separate justice for Aboriginal people.

4. In early October 2006 several large graffiti signs were painted on the Bermagui Bridge and adjacent roadway stating - ""Nigger, nigger, nigger, the KKK is getting stronger every day"" etc. A former Bermagui policeman, wanting to diffuse the matter, then painted it over. No inquiry, it would appear, was made to identify the racist graffitti [sic] writer/s [sic] identity and no further action was taken.

5. A short time later, 7th October, 2006, a scuffle occurred at the Bermagui bridge between three younger members of the Aboriginal Campbell family and some young whites. Following this at 1.30am on 8th October, 2006 two carloads of drunk whites arrived at the Campbell's home with the intention to invade and bash them with threats to set the house alight, and them calling to the sleeping residents ""burn them, burn those coons, niggers etc."" Some were armed with iron bars and poles with nails attached and these later became court exhibits. It would appear that the attackers were under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Ice was in liberal supply in the area at the time and allegedly was being supplied by an older man in the community (well known to police) whose home the offenders had visited that evening after a long drinking session at the Bermagui Country Club where they were asked to leave.

6. Awoken and terrified, the Campbells telephoned the police as they faced a shouting and attacking mob of approximately 20 plus young white people. The police finally attended at approximately 3 am after many phone calls by the Campbells seeking police intervention. As a result of this attack, the Campbell's son, Ian was injured and concussed. Hospital diagnosis suggested that he could well have been in danger of losing his left eye or being left with permanent sight damage. The result of this attack has left severe and lasting emotional and psychological damage not only for Ian but for his entire family.

7. At the time of the attack on their home, several very young children were sleeping in a tent on the front lawn. They were small cousins who were visiting for a ""sleep-over"" and they were extremely terrified by what had occurred. Despite the need for mandatory reporting when young children are involved in violent events, this matter was not reported to DOCs by the police. In my role as the family's social worker, I made a report to DOCs on 24th Oct. 2006 Ref. No: 1-9FIF91 and confirmed by a Mr. Quadan.

8. When the police finally arrived, the attending officers ordered the attackers to leave, without any arrests and without any breath testing conducted. Given their reported and very apparent intoxicated state it is very concerning that they were allowed to drive away in their cars.

9. Later that same day the young Indigenous Campbells, Ian, Garry, and Vivian were asked to attend the Bermagui police station. This was without their parents being present or informed and with the young people still very affected by trauma resulting from the invasion/assault. Contrary to legal requirements the police failed to contact the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) and a letter from the ALS solicitor confirmed that no fax had been received from the police concerning the detention of any of Campbells or their cousins Steven Rotumah and Brett Rotumah.

10. Upon their arrival at the Bermagui police station the Campbells were arrested and charged with assault and affray. At this time none of the white offenders had been interviewed.

11. I was contacted by the family on 13th October 2006 in my role as CEO (and social worker) of the Elm Grove Sanctuary Trust which is a charitable foundation working to provide social justice support and counselling to those requiring it. I assisted the Campbell's [sic] to make a formal, official complaint to the Deputy Premier, then Minister for Police, the Hon J A Watkins MP, and also to the NSW Ombudsman, Mr Bruce Barbour, regarding the procedures followed by the investigating officers in the case.

12. On 26th October 2006 I was asked by the Campbells to attend their home as a witness to a very over-powering and bullying attitude by phone of the Mayor of Bega Valley Shire Council, Mr Tony Allen, who stated that he would be coming to their home within ten minutes to speak to them regarding their letter to the Ombudsman. Mrs Campbell then asked that the Mayor delay his visit till later in the day until her husband was home from school, however the Mayor refused to delay his visit and proceeded to come to their residence.

13. Mrs Campbell was feeling extremely intimidated by his attitude and immediately contacted me to attend as her support person and to witness the event. She then telephoned her husband at Bermagui Primary School, where he is the Aboriginal Liason [sic] Officer, and he came home due to the urgency of the situation.

14. Mr Allen and his deputy Mrs Janette Neilson arrived as stated and immediately requested that I leave. The Campbells indicated that I was there at their request and therefore I remained. The Mayor was exceedingly aggressive and controlling in his attitude and basically wanted the Campbells to rescind their complaints to the Minister and Ombudsman and also to ensure that this would not appear in the media. Later I was told by a local newspaper that they were threatened with legal action by the Mayor should this incident be reported. I believe this threat was made in order to protect tourism and property price interests. Therefore no in-depth media release was ever published and very few people in the community were made aware of this racial attack.

15. Following their letter to the Ombudsman and the Minister of Police, the matter was followed up by Far South Coast Police Local Area Commander, Superintendent Jeff Loy, within the terms of Part 8A of the Police Act 1990. Inspector Peter Volf investigated the complaint and interviewed Mr and Mrs Campbell at their home on 6th December, 2006 in my presence. I was later informed in writing by Hon. Matt Brown MP, then Parliamentary Secretary for Police, that Superintendent Loy had reported back that Inspector Volf had said that Mr and Mrs Campbell had expressed their acceptance of his explanation of the manner in which police acted in response to the matter. I would state that at no time did I hear Mr or Mrs Campbell indicate their acceptance, to Inspector Volf, rather Mr Campbell stated at the finalisation of the meeting that they were ""still not happy with the police handling of the matter"".

16. On November 17th, 2006, I also contacted the Errol Wyles Justice Foundation to report the attack and the inadequate follow-up by police, and they agreed to assist in the matter as they saw it to be ""disturbing and needing intervention"". Solicitor Craig Longman of Levitt Robinson, Solicitors Sydney then agreed to take up the matter.

17. In Bega Local Court, beginning 12th - 15th June 2007 and resuming 25th June 2007 the Campbells were convicted of assault and affray. Senior Counsel Peter King defended them and immediately applied to the Supreme Court on appeal. This appeal commenced on 11th March 2008 based upon the inappropriate handling of the case by the police and the court. The Sydney Morning Herald featured this case on Pg 1 of their 12th March, 2008 edition.

18. Back in Bermagui and Narooma Mrs Campbell then reported being continually pulled over for alleged traffic offences which then turned out to be non-existent. The Campbells reported to me that ostracism and banning of the family from public venues occurred. The Campbells certainly felt under siege and as out-casts [sic] in their community.

19. On April 15, 2008 an article appeared in the Bermagui Times (a supplement of the Bega District News) announcing a police bravery award to Snr. Constable Barry (Narooma Police) for his actions on 8th October 2006, and also for ""his investigation skills in conducting an efficient, detailed and timely investigation that secured so many arrests, in which all parties have been convicted due to the quality of the investigation and the evidence supplied by Senior Const. Barry"". This award being handed down while the case was still under appeal in the Supreme Court over the inappropriate police handling of the matter. This purely served to further distress the Campbell family.

20. The Campbell's appeal was heard before Justice J. Hidden on 11th and 12th March, 2008 and their Counsel was Mr Peter Kind and solicitor L Behrendt. The Campbell's [sic] subsequently won their appeal in the Supreme Court with judgement [sic] being handed down on 3rd December 2008 by Justice Hidden that due to the police not acting in accordance with the law in regard to interviewing Aboriginal persons that their appeal would be upheld. Senior Counsel, Peter Kind in defending the Campbells said, ""that a law intended to help Aborigines had been 'deliberately disregarded' by police who had failed to inform them of their rights to have the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service present during their questioning"".

21. Sect. [sic] 20 of the judgement [sic] states -

The fact remains that the plaintiffs were interviewed at a time when cl33 had not been complied with and when, to the knowledge of the police, there could not have been effective compliance. No explanation was forthcoming on the evidence on the voire [sic] dire for the interviews being conducted at the time they were, rather than at another time when the requirements of cl33 could have been met. As the evidence stood, the failure to comply with the clause was deliberate, a relevant matter by virtue of s 138(3)(e) of the Evidence Act.

22. Gary Campbell's family, whose heritage connection to Bermagui and surrounding areas dates back for many centuries, have now once again been the victims of a further unprovoked, racially-based, vicious attack.

23. At approximately 1am on the New Year's Day, 2009 Gary, his wife Muriel, and family were leaving the Bermagui Country Club to walk home when it is alleged they were attacked by two young white men who identified themselves as brothers from Cobargo. One allegedly stating that he was in the army ""I'm not afraid of the Police and I have guns and I can shoot you black c--ts any time I want to. You may have won in Sydney but you won't win this tonight.""

24. Gary now most likely faces surgery due to the kicking that he endured after being knocked to the ground and he and the other family members endeavour to heal both physically and emotionally.

25. Currently they await the outcome of the local Police action in relation to this matter. However, it is now three weeks since the attack and no charges have been laid and it would appear that the attackers have not been interviewed over the matter. Given the long delay to take action by the police, any sign of subsequent injury to the perpetrators [sic] hands will now be healed, thereby destroying most valuable evidence.

26. I am informed that the attackers [sic] identity is known and also that one of the alleged is in the Australian Defence Force (Army). I have also been told by a member of the Narooma police that they are known to police. I have also been informed by Narooma Police, who are handling this latest matter, that no action had been taken as yet due to them ""having been too busy"".

27. I am deeply concerned at the apparent prevailing Police culture which, on the face of it, seems to offer a separate form of justice for indigenous persons. One can even be forgiven for beginning to think that this ""go-slow"" campaign by the police in this latest matter with the Campbells is intentional and the result of resentment at the outcome of the Supreme Court judgement [sic]. I would most certainly like to think that I might be wrong in making this observation.

28. I believe that it is time that some definte [sic] and positive action be taken to investigate this attitude and to seek ways to provide better models to offset prevailing attitudes.

29. Gary [sic] parents George and Sadie Campbell reared their family in Bermagui as did his grandparents William and Ada and his great grandparents Thomas Ninum Campbell and Ada May Coombes, and great-great grandparents Margaret Nixon and William James Campbell who was born at Tilba prior to white settlement in this area.

30. For Gary and all his family their connection to the land in Bermagui is rooted in a deep respect and a strong sense of belonging. Gary as the Aboriginal Liason [sic] Officer at Bermagui Primary School feels honoured to share his family history and knowledge with the children that he teaches. Gary Campbell believes that the future is for all of us to share however it would appear that there are a minority of bigoted and racially-focused young people in the local area who do not share this conviction.

31. I believe that better leadership by those in responsible positions, especially a review of local policing culture and the founding of instructive programs to build better understanding is urgently needed so that we might circumvent far more serious events from occurring.

32. I respectfully request that you give this situation your consideration and that you take subsequent action to closely and independently investigate mine and indeed the wider community's concerns by introducing remedial measures so as to improve this situation.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,

The imputations 

18The four imputations arising from the matter complained of are:

(a)The plaintiff, the Mayor of Bega Valley Shire, conducted himself inappropriately as Mayor in that he bullied a woman.

(b)The plaintiff, the Mayor of Bega Valley Shire, conducted himself inappropriately as Mayor in that he attended a woman's home against her express wishes.

(c)The plaintiff intimidated a woman by acting in a bullying and overpowering manner over the phone.

(d)The plaintiff was aggressive towards a woman in her home.

The issues for determination

19The plaintiff has already succeeded in relation to imputations (b) and (d) in the first hearing, in that the defendant has failed to prove them true. If the defendant fails to prove imputations (a) and (c) true, then the plaintiff is entitled to damages for all four imputations. If the defendant succeeds in proving imputations (a) and (c) true then the issue is what impact this will have on damages.

20The conduct of a partial rehearing of proceedings is difficult for any judge. I accordingly encouraged the parties to indicate to me the way they wished this rehearing to proceed. This included such issues as whether further oral evidence should be led, whether the transcript of the earlier proceedings should be tendered, whether issue estoppels arose from the first hearing (and if so, what these were) and how the question of assessment of damages should be approached. 

21The first problem is that the facts in dispute relate to a telephone conversation between the plaintiff and Mrs Campbell which occurred on 26 October 2006, nearly eight years ago, about which the parties first gave evidence in July 2010, nearly four years ago. This is relevant in determining what to make of differences in the evidence given by both parties between what is asserted in the matter complained of, the evidence in the proceedings in July 2010, and the evidence before me. Both parties complain that the opposing party has given different evidence in the hearing before me, or ""embellished"" the case (plaintiff's written submissions, paragraph 1) by raising matters not raised at the first hearing. 

22Mr Connell submits (written submissions, paragraph 1) that the essential elements of the phone call giving rise to imputations (a) and (c) are:

(a)The allegation of refusal by the plaintiff to delay his visit;

(b)That the plaintiff intended to come alone, and while Mrs Campbell was alone; and

(c)Whether the plaintiff used a bullying tone or manner of speech.

23Mr Connell also submits that the defendant is issue-estopped on the following matters by reason of the findings made in favour of the plaintiff at the first hearing:





Matter or Finding

Finding that the plaintiff and Mrs Neilson had each taken the steps that they had each promised to take at the meeting with the Campbells on 9 October 2006, and that the defendant prepared the letter to the Ombudsman for the Campbells, which the plaintiff received from the editor of the local newspaper.

Colefax SC DCJ: [29] (and hence [21] and [28])

Court of Appeal: [19]-[24]

24Mr Connell referred me to the following authorities on issue estoppel: Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 335 at [1], [2], [23], [24] and [27]; Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v Exportchleb [1966] 1 QB 630 at 642- 643; Thoday v Thoday [1964] P 181 at 199-200; Tiufino v Warland (2000) 50 NSWLR 104 per Handley JA (Powell JA agreeing) at [50]) and Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [126]. This is the extent of his submissions on this issue. 

25Mr Evatt confined his submissions on issue estoppel to a statement that the defendant was not issue estopped on any part of the evidence, and should be entitled to lead all relevant evidence, including evidence of the meeting in the laneway. I have rejected this submission.

26In practical terms, the question of issue estoppel has little role to play in the findings of fact. The principal evidence consists of the evidence of the plaintiff, the Deputy Mayor and Mrs Campbell concerning the contents of the telephone call. (Mr Mann, who was also in the car, was unable to remember much at all of the conversation, and Mr Campbell knew only what Mrs Campbell told him about the call). There were no findings of fact on these issues in the first hearing. The defendant's evidence, its truth or falsity, and issues of her credit, are of limited relevance to these issues. Beyond repeating what she claims Mrs Campbell told her in a subsequent telephone call, the defendant played no part in the conversations that led to this meeting.

27Both counsel took a combative approach to the tender of material by the opponent and to the case as a whole. It is clear, from the transcript before me, that this was also the case in the proceedings before Colefax SC DCJ. In view of the undesirability of a third trial, in circumstances where publication is limited and the defendant is bankrupt, I have restricted my findings with care to the narrow compass of matters identified in the Court of Appeal's judgment, and in particular to the matters set out therein at [86]-[87].

28The Court of Appeal judgment does not refer to the parties' submissions about the findings of Colefax SC DCJ on quantum, such as the award of aggravated compensatory damages for the pleading and subsequent withdrawal of the defence of contextual justification, or the impact of the purported ""apology"" given in court by the defendant. The parties have elected to address the issue of damages from an entirely fresh viewpoint, and I have accepted their wishes on this issue. 

29For convenience, I shall refer throughout to the evidence of the parties in the proceedings before Colefax SC DCJ as evidence in ""the first hearing"". To avoid confusion, extracts of transcript from the first hearing are italicised.

The plaintiff's evidence on justification issues

30The plaintiff's evidence in both proceedings was that, apart from the meeting with the Campbells about one to two weeks beforehand, he had not met them before and had never been to their home:

""Q. Well, you went to her home, so where does she live?
A. I, I took directions from Ms Neilson. I don't - I can't tell you where she lives."" (T 111 lines 26-27)

31The plaintiff's evidence in the first hearing was that he learned of publication of the matter complained of on the morning of 22 October and that during the morning he drove from Bega to Bermagui, the town in which not only Mr and Mrs Campbell but also the Deputy Mayor lived. This town is about one hour's distance from Bega by car. The plaintiff's evidence in the first hearing was that the phone call to Mrs Campbell was made from Councillor Neilson's home at Bermagui (T 29 lines 17-21). Prior to making the call, he had a discussion with her as follows:

""Q. So what did you say to Councillor Neilson and what did she say to you?
A. I said I was very, very, very, very upset about the content of the letter and she said that she was also very concerned about the content of the letter. And we discussed it, as to what we should do about it and we agreed that we should ring the Campbells and seek a meeting with the Campbells to discuss why the letter had to be written.

Q. What did you do then?
A. I phoned the Campbells."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 30 lines 7-15)

32The plaintiff described the contents of the conversation during the first hearing as follows:

""Q. What did she say?
A. She said, well, she just said: ""Muriel speaking"". And I said, ""Mrs Campbell"" or ""Muriel"" I just can't recall. But I would have called her Mrs Campbell, I am sure. ""I have a letter in my possession which I would like the opportunity to come and discuss with you and your husband."" She said: ""Mr Allen"" or ""Tony"", ""My husband is not here at the present time. He's at school. He won't be back for half an hour. Could you wait until then?"" I said: ""Certainly. I can wait til then."" That was the end of the conversation.

Q. About what time of day did this conversation take place?
A. The conversation took about, took place about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.

Q. What did you do then?
A. Mrs Neilson and I then went from Mrs Neilson's house to Bermagui. Mrs Neilson said, ""I believe we should contact Mr John Manns"", who was very well known to the Aboriginal community, just to show the Campbells out of respect to them that we had had Mr Manns there, just as a sign of respect to the Campbells."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 31 lines 15-32)

33The plaintiff repeated this at T 71-72:

""I did ring the Campbells to arrange that meeting but I certainly was not overpowering and bullying, I really just can't believe that that could be put as a reaction to a simple phone call asking Mrs Campbell for permission to come and talk with she and her husband. I most certainly did not, as stated here, that ""I would be coming to their home within 10 minutes to speak with them"", I did not at any stage say to Mrs Campbell anything other than I would be happy to wait as long as was necessary for her husband to come home from school but indeed I was wanting to talk to them about the letter to the ombudsmen. I certainly didn't refuse to delay my visit, I said to Mrs Campbell that I was happy to wait until her husband came home..."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 71 line 43 to T 72 line 2)

34The evidence of the plaintiff was thus that the telephone call to Mrs Campbell was made, at the latest, from Mrs Neilson's house at Bermagui, and that after he made the call to Mrs Campbell, he telephoned Mr Manns to invite him to participate:

""Q. Did you make a phone call to him [Mr Mann]?
A. No, Mrs Neilson that's a good question. I believe I made the phone call. My memory's not that good but I would have had the phone. I would have made the phone call, yes.

Q. Anyway you said before you met up with Mr Manns?
A. Before we met up with Mr Manns?

Q. Sorry. You met up with Mr Manns?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. What did you do and where did you go/
A. We waited we met Mr Manns in Bermagui and then we waited until we believed Mr Campbell would be home, well and truly home from school before we went to drove the car to the Campbells' where the Campbells lived.

Q. Okay and what happened then?
A. We got out of the car and walked we were walking up towards the Campbell house.

Q. Who is we?
A. The deputy mayor, Jeannette Neilson, and John Manns and myself.

Q. Yes?
A. We walked up a laneway and the Campbells were waiting in the laneway to meet us.

Q. Yes. And what happened then?
A. We naturally said hello and I noticed Mr and Mrs LloydJones away to the side and I indicated to the Campbells that I had just come to discuss the content of the letter and I asked why Mr and Mrs LloydJones should be there. Mrs Campbell said they were there because she has asked them to come. I said: ""That's quite okay. I would just like to discuss the contents of the letter with the Campbells."""" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 31 line 43 to T 32 line 33)

35The plaintiff's account of these events in the proceedings before me demonstrated a different, and slightly shorter, timeline. He had already decided to go to the Campbells' home after discussing this with Councillor Neilson, and set off on the one-hour trip from Bega to her home, just outside Bermagui (about five minutes by car from the Campbells' home). Councillor Neilson had decided to invite Mr John Manns to come as well, and it was she who had arranged to meet him in Bermagui at the garage which was within eyesight of the Campbell's home. More importantly, the plaintiff agreed that he had not telephoned Mrs Campbell from Councillor Neilson's home, contrary to his evidence in the first hearing:

""A. I came to her place and - and she had thought about the meeting, obviously, and she said that she had contacted Mr John Manns to come to the meeting just to - out of respect to the Campbells, because for reasons that he was highly respected amongst the Aboriginal community and we weren't going there to be - we were just going there to reassure them that we were, we were genuine in our, in our desire to help them. So she arranged for Mr Manns to come there. And I apologise to the Court. I think in evidence I said that I made the phone call to the Campbells at Ms Neilson's house.

That wasn't the case in, in recollection, because I presumed and I think Ms Neilson perhaps presumed that I had made the phone call or that she had made the phone call to organise a meeting and a time with the Campbells. But on the way to Bermagui to meet Mr Manns, she asked if I'd rung the Campbells and I said I hadn't. And she said, ""Well, we - someone should."" So I, I said, ""Well, we'll - when we, when we get to, when we get to Bermagui with - to meet Mr Manns, we'll make the call."" It was, it was an oversight and I apologise to the Court for - because it's only a five minute drive from Ms Neilson's house to the, to the service station where we met Mr Manns. So I was five minutes out in the timing, but that's what occurred."" (T 53 lines 21-39).

36In other words, the plaintiff's telephone call to Mrs Campbell asking to see her was made while he was sitting in his car a short distance from the Campbells' home, with Mr Mann and Councillor Neilson already in the car with him. The likelihood that he conveyed to Mrs Campbell that he was already on the way to her home, and that he wanted a meeting within a particular time frame, needs to be viewed in context of these facts. 

37The plaintiff's written submissions described this as being a difference in timing of five minutes of ""no particular significance"" (written submissions, paragraph 2(b)), in that it adds only about five minutes in time to the plaintiff's timeline. Mr Connell submits it is irrelevant whether the conversation took place in the plaintiff's car while he was not only on the way to Mrs Campbell's home but within sight of it, or from the Deputy Mayor's home, about five minutes from the Campbell's home by car. He adds: ""There is significance in the fact that Mr Manns and Mr Wells had already been organised to attend as clearly they would be inconvenienced if the meeting was rescheduled for another day and the plaintiff was concerned not to inconvenience Mr Manns: T 59, 182.""

38These submissions unduly gloss over the facts. Firstly, the plaintiff gave no evidence before me of inviting Mr Wells (the neighbour at whose home the October 2006 meeting had taken place) to this meeting, or that Mrs Campbell had been told of this. His evidence was similar at the first trial; he agreed at the first hearing (T 173) that he had not mentioned Mr Wells at all during examination in chief. The Deputy Mayor, in her evidence in this hearing (T 213) was that she had reconsidered her evidence about when she had telephoned Mr Mann and Mr Wells and realised she must have done this using her land line at home (T 213), before driving to the Bermagui petrol station to pick up Mr Mann. This was, of course, when the plaintiff and the Deputy Mayor realised that neither of them had telephoned the Campbells to see if they were prepared to have a meeting and, if so, at what time, and with what persons present. 

39The fact that Mr Wells arrived 15 minutes after the meeting started is one of a series of pieces of evidence suggestive of the fact that this meeting was organised in a hurried fashion and a short time frame. More importantly, there is no evidence before me, or in the first hearing, that Mr Wells' presence formed part of the arrangements consequential on an agreed meeting, or that Mrs Campbell was told of it, or that Mr Wells' convenience had to be consulted. Nor is it clear why the convenience of Mr Manns, a retired person, was more important than the convenience of Mr Campbell, who had to come home from work early to attend this meeting. As to the importance of the roles of both Mr Manns and Mr Wells at the meeting, it is not in dispute that the plaintiff did not even tell Mrs Campbell that either of them was coming. 

40Having noted the plaintiff's change in evidence about when and where the telephone call was made, I next note the plaintiff's description of what was said during his phone call to Mrs Campbell. In the hearing before me, he described the contents of the telephone call as follows: 

""Q. --what that person said and what you said?
A. To the best of my recollection, a lady answered the phone and I said, ""Look, it's Tony Allen calling. Is this Mrs Campbell?"" and she said, she said, ""Yes, it's Mrs Campbell,"" and I said, ""I have a letter that you and Gary have written to the Ombudsman and I would like the opportunity"" - and I can't remember whether I said ""I"" or ""we"", probably ""we"" because John Manns and Ms Neilson were also in the car at the time - ""we'd like the opportunity just to come and have a yarn about what's in the letter.""

Q. And what did she say to you?
A. Ms Campbell said that Mr Campbell wasn't at the house at the time and that she would prefer that I didn't come at that stage and I said, ""That's fine. When will Mr Campbell be back?"" She said that he was detained at school for a half hour but he'd be back in half an hour and I said, ""Okay. Would it be okay to come, be convenient to come around in half an hour?"" and she said, ""Yes."""" (T 54 line 45 - T 55 line 10)

41The plaintiff described his tone of voice during the phone call as being ""the same as it is today"" and Mrs Campbell's tone of voice is ""normal"". He was certain that she was happy for him to come to her home and happy for them to wait in the car for her husband to come home from the school where he was working:

""Q. What was your state of mind at the time of making that phone call?
A. That it had been a long day and this, this had, this had, this is the first time I'd come across this letter and because, because of the responsibilities that I attach to the role of the mayor and the promise that I'd made to the Campbells and to the Wellses and to Ms Neilson, I was very conscious of the need to protect our integrity and the integrity of the office that I hold or held, and so my state of mind was that we needed to talk to the Campbells and, and, and just find out what had gone wrong, if anything had gone wrong, and whether we could be of further assistance.

Q. After the phone call finished, what happened next?
A. When the phone call finished, I do remember - and this is the recollection that brought back the timing of the phone call. I do remember turning around to Mr Manns and apologising for holding him up a further half hour or perhaps longer. You don't like to have people's lives disrupted so I, I remember turning around and apologising to him because we had to wait that extra half hour before we could have the meeting.

Q. Sorry, can you just say what words you said to him?
A. I said, ""John, old mate, I'm apologising. We, we don't have, we can't go to the meeting straight away. You'll have to bear with us for another half hour before we can go and meet with the Campbells.""

Q. Yes, and what did you do then?
A. We waited.

Q. For how long?
A. Approximately half an hour."" (T 58 line 21 to T 59 line 17)

42Mr Evatt read aloud to the plaintiff the following evidence he had given in the first hearing:

""Q. ... Line M, ""Above what time of day did this conversation take place?"" ""The conversation took place about 3 o'clock in the afternoon."" ""What did you do then?"" ""Mrs Neilson and I then went to Mrs Neilson's house to Bermagui. Mrs Neilson said, 'I believe we should contact John Manns.'""
A. Yes.

Q. John Manns wasn't in the car when you had that conversation, was he?
A. I explained this morning that, that I, in hindsight, got that wrong with the Court and I apologise to, I apologise to the Court for that."" (T 121 lines 5-36)

43Mr Evatt asked:

""Q. Mr Allen, what did you want to discuss with Ms Campbell about the letter?
A. We wanted to just - we wanted to clear up any misunderstandings or any confusion that had arisen since the meeting in the Wells' house.

Q. No, you said, ""I have a letter in my possession which I would like to come and discuss with you."" What was it about the letter that you wanted to discuss with them about the letter?
A. The obvious confusion that the letter stated that we hadn't done what we've promised to do and we wanted to speak to--

Q. You wanted--
A. --the Campbells--

HER HONOUR: No, don't interrupt Mr Evatt.

Q. You wanted to what, sorry?
A. Speak to the Campbells about whether there is a misunderstanding or whether there is other issues that we needed to help them with.

EVATT

Q. You wanted your name taken out of it.
A. No.

Q. Is that right?
A. No. The letter was already sent. It was gone.

Q. What?
A. The letter had already been - it was, it was, it had already gone to the ombudsman.

Q. Yes, but you could write a retracting letter couldn't you?
A. We hadn't thought about that at the time but we did.

Q. That's what you exactly thought of?
A. No.

Q. And you were angry?
A. No.

Q. What else has ""very, very, very, very upset me""?
A. Exactly that, that I was very disappointed and confused that a meeting of friends--

Q. You were confused?
A. I was confused, absolutely confused.

Q. Why were you confused?
A. Because we'd gone in good faith to a meeting of friends of friends and Ms Nielson was a friend of both parties and we'd exchanged phone numbers--"" (T 129 line 3 to T 130 line 2)

44Finally, I note that the plaintiff telephoned the Campbell home in the evening, which the plaintiff described as ""friendly"" (T 81). Mr Connell submits that it was the defendant's obligation to rebut this evidence and not his obligation to cross-examine (Hyhonie Holdings Pty Ltd v Leroy [2004] NSWCA 72). This is a difficult area, because the parties had agreed that the evidence would not include the events in the laneway or subsequent to that meeting, which would include this later phone call. However, the fact that the meeting proceeded in accordance with Colefax SC DCJ's findings, and that there was a friendly phone call afterwards, does not amount to evidence that the circumstances in which the meeting was called could not have been as stated by Mrs Campbell.

45Why was the most senior local government representative in the Shire wanting to come to the home of persons he had met only on this one occasion, in order to speak to them about a letter of complaint they had sent to the Ombudsman, and expecting that they would be happy to do so? Mr Connell submits (written submissions, paragraph 1(e)) that the plaintiff had been elected as a Councillor and Mayor a number of times over a lengthy period, and had performed these duties with constant interaction with the community in which he lived; evidence to this effect was given both in the first hearing (at T 19 - 20) and before me. Mr Connell goes on to note that the plaintiff was ""no stranger to the Aboriginal community and also might properly be thought to know what was appropriate behaviour in this small country town (Exhibit A p. 15.11, 20.16.3)"". The issues in Mr and Mrs Campbell's letter did not only concern them, but also the wider community (Exhibit 5, p. 305); T 53. In those circumstances, it was not necessary just to leave it to the Ombudsman to deal with the complaint. The plaintiff and the Deputy Mayor behaved with tact and prudence in so doing, according to Mr Connell's written submissions.

46Mr Connell submits that it was not put to the plaintiff, Mrs Neilson or Mr Manns ""by counsel or the Court"" in either of the hearings that this was ""at all inappropriate leave alone an act of bullying, to contact Mrs Campbell and ask for a meeting with her and her husband"" (written submissions 2(g)) and that none of the defendants gave evidence in support of such a case, including Mr Gary Campbell (Exhibit 7), who was not at home when the plaintiff called Mrs Campbell. I note, however, that it would not have been proper for the Court to put such a question to any witness, and the opinions of any witness as to whether the plaintiff's conduct was inappropriate or bullying should not take the place of a careful analysis of the factual material before the court. The question of whether this conduct was inappropriate or an act of bullying is an issue of fact for determination by me, not for the opinions of witnesses.

47At the time that the plaintiff was making this telephone call from his car, two other persons were with him. The first of these was the Deputy Mayor, Councillor Neilson.

The Deputy Mayor's evidence

48The plaintiff's submissions place great weight on Deputy Mayor, Councillor Neilson's, ""discretion and experience"" as ""a woman of some considerable experience"" (written submissions paragraph 2(a)). She had agreed to the plaintiff's proposal of going to see the Campbells, and made two contributions to this scheme. First, she invited Mr Manns to attend as a support person for the Campbells (and, it would appear from her evidence at T 213, she spoke to Mr Manns; according to her evidence in the first hearing, she also asked Mr Wells, but she did not refer to this in the hearing before me). Secondly, she suggested, having discovered that the plaintiff had not telephoned the Campbells to arrange the meeting that day, that he do so.

49The Deputy Mayor's description, in the first hearing, of how she came to accompany the plaintiff to the Campbells' home was as follows:

""Q. So with that structure in mind can you take up what was said by whom after the general manager had offered to prepare a letter for you and the mayor to sign to go to the ombudsman?
A. The mayor said, ""I would like to go and discuss this with the Campbells"" and I said, ""Well I'd be quite prepared to come with you to have a discussion with them. Maybe there is something that we missed that we should have done.""

CONNELL

Q. Where did this conversation take place?
A. That conversation with the mayor took place not in the general manager's office but after we had left and we were travelling back home.

Q. Back to whose home?
A. Well, generally what happened, I would take my car to Cobargo and leave it there and I would travel in with the mayor because it's a lot cheaper, it saves money. So it would have been in the car coming back from Bega which is approximately an hour away from where we live.

Q. And did something happen about that suggestion, was something done about it?
A. Yes, yes.

Q. What happened?
A. The mayor travelled down to Bermagui and we drove into town and we parked in town and the mayor decided, he said, ""I will call the Campbells to make sure they are home and to ensure it's okay to come and visit them.""

Q. At about what time of day was this?
A. It was in the afternoon maybe around 2.30, something like that, I'm not exactly sure but it was in the afternoon though definitely. The reason I recall it was in the afternoon was because the mayor then rang the Campbells and Muriel answered the phone.

Q. What did you observe or hear?
A. I heard it because he had the phone in the car, I was in the car with him.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Could you hear both sides of the conversation, or was it on
A. No, it wasn't on speaker phone.

Q. So you could just hear the mayor?
A. Yes.

Q. Could you tell me what you heard him say?
A. The mayor said, ""Hello Muriel, we are in Bermagui and I have a letter here that you have sent to the ombudsman expressing concern that we haven't done some of the things that we agreed to do for you and I'd like to come up and discuss it with yourself and Gary."" She said, ""Well Gary's not home."" Sorry, I can't tell you that.

Q. You didn't hear that, did you?
A. No, I didn't hear that.

Q. Don't tell me something you didn't hear?
A. No, when the mayor hung up the phone he turned round and advised me.

[Objection]

Q. Not saying what the mayor said to you about what Muriel said to him, what happened next?
A. There was an interim during which we were waiting for Gary Campbell to come home from school. He worked at the school, and during that time

Q. About how long was that interval?
A. Probably halfanhour, about that.

Q. And during that time?
A. And during that time I decided to call John Manns who was very well respected by the aboriginal community because, in my view, I didn't want to go to the Campbells' with them feeling challenged. In my view, we were going there to find out what was wrong, what the issues were, because the letter clearly indicated there were problems, and I personally wanted someone there who had a strong rapport with the aboriginal community, to reassure them. So I rang John Manns I took the mayor's phone from him, and I rang John Manns, and I asked John, ""would you be prepared to come down to a meeting with the Campbells in relation to the incidents that happened in Hill Street and other issues"", and he said his answer to me was

""I'd be prepared to come but I will only be at a meeting if Gary and Muriel are happy for me to be there"", and I said, ""that's fine, we'll leave that to them"", and I told him where we were, and he came down and met us, and we waited"" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 242 line 39 to T 244 line 48)

50The Deputy Mayor's evidence in these proceedings was that she had made errors in her evidence in the first hearing. The plaintiff had not said that he would ring the Campbells, or rung from them from her home, or rung them before Mr Mann was contacted. The plaintiff had rung the Campbells from his car after both the plaintiff and Councillor Neilson realised each had assumed the other would telephone the Campbells, but neither had. In cross-examination, Councillor Neilson explained:

""Q. Did he not say when he picked you up, ""I'll ring the Campbells""? This is when he picked you up?
A. (No verbal reply)

Q. Otherwise, you see, you say, ""And we parked in town""?
A. Yes. 

Q. I just can't work out why you would drive into town if it wasn't see the Campbells. That's all?
A. Well, we were going into town and I, I presumed that he'd already rung them. And I found that he hadn't rung them and so he said, ""Well, I'll ring them."" And we'd already organised to meet John Manns at Bridge Motors. So he rang them from there. We were, we were parked at Bridge Motors. 

Q. When you were at your home--
A. Yes. 

Q. --did he say, ""Look, I want to discuss this with the Campbells""?
A. He said that over the telephone before he got to my place and asked me would I come with him. 

Q. Did he say he wanted a meeting with the Campbells?
A. Well, he wanted to find out what we hadn't done, what, what was wrong because we thought we'd done everything they asked. And he didn't understand what was - the problem was. 

Q. Yes. But did he say he wanted to meet the Campbells--
A. Yes. 

Q. --to discuss those matters?
A. Yes. 

Q. Then you say at line 20--
A. Line 20. 

Q. ""He rang the Campbells and Muriel answered the phone."" Is that right?
A. Well, he told me it was Muriel. Yes. Because he--

Q. He said he was ringing the Campbells, didn't he?
A. Yes. And, and, and it was Muriel because he - Muriel said - he said, ""Hello, Muriel."" 

Q. You couldn't hear who answered?
A. No. He said, ""Hello, Muriel."", so I knew it was Muriel and he said, ""It's Tony Allen calling."" 

Q. Then he said, ""I have a letter here I want to talk to you about."" Is that right?
A. Yes. To the best of my recollection, yes. 

Q. I'm down to line 35?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""Hello, Muriel""?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""We are in Bermagui""?
A. Yes. 

Q. First of all, he said, ""I'm Tony"" - you know, ""I'm Tony Allen, the mayor""?
A. ""It's, it's Tony Allen calling."" 

Q. Right?
A. Yeah. 

Q. ""Hello, Muriel. We're in Bermagui""?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""I have a letter here that you sent to the ombudsman."" Right?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""Expressing concern that we haven't done something - some of the things that we agreed to do""?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""I want to come up and discuss this with you and Gary""?
A. Yes. 

Q. Right?
A. Yes. 

Q. He was angry when he said that?
A. No, he wasn't at all. 

Q. Was he happy when he said that?
A. He was just matter of fact. 

Q. He was happy?
A. Well, I don't know that he was happy or sad. He was just ordinary. 

Q. He was very, very, very, very upset, wasn't he?
A. No. 

Q. What?
A. No. 

Q. He wasn't?
A. No. He was confused I would say. 

Q. Well, just a moment. Didn't he say to you that he was very, very, very, very upset about the content of the letter?
A. To me?

Q. Yes, to you?
A. He said to me that he couldn't understand it. I can't remember the exact words. You said that's a long time ago but he didn't - I don't recall him saying to me that he was very, very, very, very upset. 

Q. So if he said he had said that to you he would be wrong; is that right?
A. I don't know. I don't recall him saying it. 

Q. Did he not say to you he was very, very, very, very upset about that letter?
A. Not that I can recall. 

Q. Did you say to him you were very concerned about the letter yourself?
A. I was concerned. 

Q. What?
A. I was concerned. I was, I was confused and concerned because I thought we'd done what they'd asked us to do and it would appear that they felt we hadn't and I thought, well, what's, what's gone wrong. 

Q. Were you angry?
A. No. 

Q. The mayor was very upset, wasn't he?
A. I don't believe he was very upset. 

Q. He said to Muriel in your hearing that he wanted his name taken out of the letter?
A. No. I don't recall that at all. 

Q. You mean he didn't say it or you just can't remember whether he said it or not?
A. I don't believe he said it. 

Q. Are you there at page 243 at line 35?
A. Line 35. 

Q. Have you got that there?
A. Yes, I have. 

Q. That's the conversation that you say took place, is that right, between Mr Allen and Muriel Campbell?
A. Yes, that's correct."" (T 209 line 8 to T 212 line 2)

51The Deputy Mayor explained her change of evidence concerning ringing Mr Manns as follows:

""Q. Then you said at line 35, ""And during that time I decided to call John Manns""?
A. Yes. And that's where I, I mentioned the--

Q. What?
A. That's where I mentioned I had my timelines wrong because I rang - I, I checked my phone records and there were no calls on my mobile to John Manns. 

Q. Do you say that was wrong?
A. Yes. 

Q. ""And during that time I decided to call John Manns who's very well respected by the Aboriginal community""?
A. Yes. Yes. 

Q. Is that right?
A. Yes. I rang him from my home before we left I believe. 

Q. When did you find out that was wrong?
A. When did I find out?

Q. Yesterday?
A. No, no, no, no. 

Q. The day after you said it?
A. No.[Objection] 

Q. When did you realise your evidence before Judge Colefax was wrong?
A. I'm just trying to think. It was - it was fairly recently and it hadn't made - John, John Manns said to me that he was in the car when the phone call was made and I said to John, ""But I don't recall you being in the car"", and he said, ""I was there"", and I thought, well, how could he have been there if I rang him after he - after the phone call. So I deliberately checked my phone records and could see that there were no calls on my mobile and then when I really sat down and thought about it I realised that I - I had to have made those calls to both John and Don Wells before I left home."" (T 212 line 31 to T 213 line 30)

52Unlike the plaintiff, the Deputy Mayor had had prior dealings with the Campbells. She had provided Mr Campbell with ""a reference that kept him out of gaol"" (T 345) and her late husband had been a close friend of his. Mrs Campbell agreed that this was the case, although she added that her own association with the Deputy Mayor was limited to saying hello a few times (T 313, first hearing). 

53However, the Deputy Mayor's presence on this occasion was not presented as being in order to assist the Campbells in having a yarn or a chat with the Mayor. She was coming to see them, as was the Mayor, about the letter the Campbells had written to the Ombudsman about their assistance to the Campbells being insufficient.

54Mr Connell submits that the Deputy Mayor was not cross-examined to the effect that the procedure was inappropriate in any way, or that it amounted to bullying (and, if so, that she was complicit). He goes on to add that this is not unnatural as such a contention was never part of the plaintiff's case (submissions, paragraph 2(g)). Both these statements are incorrect. Both in this hearing, and in the first hearing (at T 273 - 4), these matters were put, although the precise question in relation to the plaintiff's telephone call to the Campbells did not refer to it taking place in the car ,because the Deputy Mayor's evidence at the first hearing was that ""he told me, the mayor said to me Muriel had asked him to wait until Gary came home from school"" (T 273), not that he made the telephone call in the car in her presence.

55It was put to the Deputy Mayor that both she and the plaintiff were very upset about the letter (T 211) and that this was why they had gone to the Campbells' home at such short notice. The Deputy Mayor denied this, but agreed that it would be inappropriate to go to the Campbells' home without an appointment (T 219). She agreed that the plaintiff always spoke in a blunt manner, and that he ""expressed his concern"" (T 220) about what the complaint to the Ombudsman said about the meeting he and the Deputy Mayor had had with the Campbells. Mr Evatt put it to the Deputy Mayor that the plaintiff spoke in a loud, ""bullying"" voice (T 220), which the Deputy Mayor denied. 

56Mr Connell submitted that the Deputy Mayor was a witness whose evidence should be given great weight, and that I should accept the her evidence, and that of Mr Manns, that the plaintiff did not speak in a menacing tone of voice (T 125, 210). This really is not the issue. I accept that the plaintiff spoke as the Deputy Mayor described, namely in a blunt manner. It was a very short phone call to someone he barely knew. ""Menacing"" is simply the wrong word to describe it. The question is whether his tone and what he was saying amounted to bullying or inappropriate language and/or conduct.

57The objective evidence shows the Deputy Mayor did have concerns about the meeting the plaintiff proposed to have with the Campbells. First, she said that she would go as well. Second, she invited not one but two persons who would be there, not to help the plaintiff, but to help the Campbells and be support persons for them, as they had been victims of a frightening incident very recently. Third, and most important, when she realised that the plaintiff had not even telephoned the Campbells to arrange a meeting, she told him to do so. I find the plaintiff's claim that he thought the Deputy Mayor had done this to be implausible, given his evidence about having Mr Campbell's telephone number on a piece of paper, the fact that he had already driven to Bermagui for such a meeting, and the fact that he was at the Deputy Mayor's home before the question of the format of the meeting (including the Deputy Mayor inviting another two persons) had crystallised.

58All of this evidence points to the Deputy Mayor endeavouring to placate an upset man, namely the plaintiff who was determined to see the Campbells that afternoon, while understanding that the Campbells might find an unexpected meeting with the two most senior local government officials in their home intimidating, particularly if there was no support person present. The Deputy Mayor's actions are more consistent with her having the belief that the Campbells would find the meeting intimidating, or feel bullied, unless they had some form of support present, as well as needing to be informed that the plaintiff was coming to see them.

59It is unfortunate that the plaintiff did not tell Mrs Campbell, when he rang, that arrangements had been made by the Deputy Mayor for both Mr Wells and Mr Mann to be present. In fact Mr Mann had told the Mayor he would only attend if the Campbells wished him to be there, yet that permission was never sought by the Mayor in the less than two minute telephone call he made to the plaintiff. It is also indicative of his state of mind, which was that he wanted to see the Campbells as soon as possible, and that other considerations (such as any need they may have for a support person) was not important. 

60This brings me to a consideration of Mr Manns' evidence. Unfortunately it is of little assistance, as Mr Manns' memory of these events is now very poor.

The evidence of Mr Manns 

61Mr Manns' evidence in the first hearing was contradictory. At T 209 of his evidence before Colefax SC DCJ Mr Manns said:

""Q. I want to ask you to tell me about that and I want you to tell me it in the first person, like a tape recording; who said what, casting your mind back and doing your best to give the substance of what they said in the first person. Who called you?
A. Jeanette Nielson.

Q. And what did she say to you?
A. She asked me would I attend the meeting with her and Tony Allen at the Campbells' residence. I said I would, providing that they were agreeable to me being there. I then was arranged to meet them and

Q. Where?
A. At well it's a placed called near Bridge Motors at Bermagui. We waited there in Tony's car for a short

Q. Sorry, just pausing. One step at a time, Mr Manns. You went to this place and about how long after the phone call had taken place did you arrive at that place?
A. I can't remember whether it was half an hour, or an hour or so, what it I'm not sure.

Q. And somebody arrived to pick you up, did they?
A. No, I drove to there.

Q. But did you then get into a car with someone else?
A. I met Anthony and Jeanette Nielson there in Anthony's car. We sat in the car for a short while.

Q. For about how long?
A. Could have been 15 minutes, half hour."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 209 line 33 to T 210 line 12).

62However, he gave the following evidence at T 227-229:

""Q. Did you hear Mr Allen ring up Mrs Campbell on the phone?
A. Before we went to the?

Q. Yes?
A. He rang to see if if Gary was there.

Q. What did he say on the phone?
A. He asked her if Gary was there.

Q. What do you understand was said by Mrs Campbell?

CONNELL: I object.

EVATT: Well he heard.

Q. Did he say what Mrs Campbell said?
A. No, he just said that Gary wasn't there at that stage, we were to wait.

Q. Mr Allen in your presence rang Mrs Campbell? Is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. After they picked you up?
A. Yes. After I after I met them.

Q. I'm a bit unclear about it. Did you go there in their car?
A. Yes.

Q. So there was three of you in the car?
A. That's right.

Q. Were you in the back?
A. Yes.

Q. Before you got into the car, did Mr Allen ring Mrs Campbell?
A. I don't know, I wasn't there.

Q. Sorry, I thought you said you heard Mr Allen ring Mrs Campbell?
A. Yes she did.

Q. Where was that?
A. I was in the car.

Q. In the car?
A. Yes.

Q. On the mobile phone?
A. Yes.

Q. I beg your pardon. Where was the car when he rang?
A. Where I said when we started, at Bridge Motors. Opposite Bridge Motors in Bermagui.

Q. He got in the car and rang Mrs Campbell on his mobile?
A. Yes.

Q. And asked whether Gary was there?
A. Yes.

Q. Then did he say what Mrs Campbell said?
A. He just said that she he wasn't back from school at that stage

Q. Yes?
A. and we would wait.

Q. We would wait?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you wait or did you drive out there?
A. No, we waited.

Q. Waited where?
A. At Bridge Motors.

Q. For how long?
A. Could have been 15 minutes, 20 minutes.

Q. How long did it take you to drive to the Campbells' place?
A. Five minutes.

Q. It's close?
A. Yes.

Q. About what time did he ring?
A. I couldn't give you a time.

Q. Was Mr Campbell there when you arrived?
A. Yes.

Q. Did his wife Muriel do all the talking?
A. Yes.
Q. Did you hear Mr Allen say to Mrs Campbell on the phone, ""I have a letter in my possession which I would like the opportunity to come and discuss with you and your husband""? Did he say that?
A. I can't remember.

Q. But you can remember him ringing and asking for Mr Gary Campbell?
A. Yeah.

Q. Did he say why he wanted to speak to Gary Campbell?
A. He wanted to confirm whether Gary was home so that he could speak to both of them together.

Q. Did you hear him ask Mrs Campbell whether he could speak to her?
A. Speak to her?

Q. Yes?
A. No.

Q. Did Mr Allen ring Mrs Campbell and did you understand that Mrs Campbell said that she didn't want to see Mr Allen?
A. No.

Q. You deny that?
A. I don't know what she said.

Q. You don't know what she said? Did Mr Allen say anything about the Campbells taking their names, that's Mr Allen sorry I'll start again. Did Mr Allen say anything to Mr or Mrs Campbell about the Campbells deleting their name from the letter to the ombudsman?
A. I don't know.

Q. Could that have happened? Could that have been said?
A. It I don't know."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 227 lines 11 to T 229 line 33)

63His evidence in these proceedings was that he was telephoned by the Deputy Mayor but ""can't remember"" (T 226) what she said. He was in the car when the plaintiff rang Mrs Campbell, but that he was unable to remember what was said (T 228), or to whom that call was made (T 227). He did not hear what was said by the other person (T 228). 

64Some of Mr Mann's answers were difficult to understand:

""Q. So you don't know whether he rang up the Campbells or not, is that right, you can't remember?
A. When he made the phone call I didn't know.

Q. Well when did you know?
A. Afterwards.

Q. While you were still in the car?
A. While we were still in the car.

Q. Why, what was said to you?
A. He turned and said to me that I had to ring Muriel to see whether Gary was home, and I when Gary wasn't there he hung up.

Q. So was this telephone conversation just very short?
A. Very short."" (T 228)

65Neither the plaintiff nor the Deputy Mayor gave evidence that this occurred. Given Mr Mann's poor recollection and recounting of a conversation with little resemblance to what occurred, his evidence is of no probative value.

The evidence of Mrs Campbell

66Mrs Campbell's evidence in the first hearing was as follows:

""A. Well I got a phone call from Mr Allen and he asked me if he could come up to my house to have a meeting with me and Gary and I explained to him that I was at the house on my own. I told him I didn't want him to come there because I was just still terrified about what happened and I specifically told him I did not want him to come, I was at the house on my own. But his reply to me on the phone was, ""I'm sorry Muriel, but I am on my way"" and then he hung up. I started to panic.

Q. How did he sound on the phone?
A. He sounded like he was coming whether I wanted it or not.

Q. Now, what did you then do?
A. I started to panic a bit. I knew that Gary, when school hours were over, he had to do a homework centre that afternoon, so I actually rang Laurel and I explained what had happened on the phone call and I asked her if she would be able to come down just to keep me company because I didn't want to be at the house on my own.

Q. Which she did?
A. Yes, she did.

Q. She came with her husband Edward?
A. Yes, and after I spoke to Laurel I actually rang Gary again at the school because I was really panicking and I said, ""You need to come home because Tony Allen rang me and he told me that he is on his way to the house"" and Gary said, ""Yes, well I'll just go and see the principal"" and then yes, it was maybe a matter of ten minutes Gary had turned up and, by that time, everybody was there."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 295 lines 17-44)

67Mrs Campbell said she told the plaintiff that she ""didn't want him to come"" (T 296), and repeated this in cross-examination:

""Q. So when you got a call from the mayor to say he wanted to talk to you about the letter to the ombudsman, you were rather surprised weren't you?
A. Yeah, no he just said, ""I need to come and speak to you and Gary"", and I said, ""No, well I don't want you to come because Gary isn't home; he's at work and I'm at the house on my own"". I specifically told him I did not want him to come, I was on my own at the house. But his like I said, his reply to me on the phone was, ""Sorry Muriel but I'm already in my car on my way"".

Q. Mrs Campbell
A. That that really scared me.

Q. Mrs Campbell, I didn't ask you that, did I?
A. Well it's part of my answer.

HIS HONOUR: Ask the question again, Mr Connell.

CONNELL

Q. Mrs Campbell, Mr Allen had rung you and said that he wanted to see you and your husband.
A. Yes.

Q. In those circumstances it would be pretty silly for him to come and see you when your husband wasn't yet home, wouldn't it?
A. Yes, I told him, ""My husband is not home, he's at work, I'm home on my own, I do not want you to come.""

Q. Do you recall what time this was?
A. Around maybe in between half past 2.00 to 3.00, somewhere around there. I could be wrong but I know it was towards the end of school time, yes somewhere around that.

Q. Because I suggest to you that, in fact, what happened was when you told him your husband wasn't home he said he'd come later?
A. No, I beg your pardon, he did not say that to me. He told me, ""It's too late Muriel, I'm in my car and I'm on my way"" and then he hung the phone up on me.

Q. The fact is he didn't turn up at your house until 3.30, did he?
A. He didn't turn up at my house at 3.30, he was down the bottom of my laneway parked at about five past 3.00.

Q. And he waited in the car, didn't he?
A. Yes, him, John Manns and Jeanette Neilson.

Q. And they waited there until after half past 3.00?
A. Not quite sure if it was after half past 3.00 but yes, it was somewhere around the quarter I'm pretty sure, yes, when I walked out of the house on to the laneway that's when I spotted the car down the bottom and they got out and I really started panicking but, by that time, Laurel and Edwin had pulled up. Gary was like coming down the laneway so it made me feel a little bit at ease because it wasn't just me there. As I am sitting here I am not lying about the phone call. When he rang me I distinctly told him I did not want him to come to my house, I was at my house on my own and my husband was at work and I did not want him to come. Like I said, his reply to me on the phone was, ""Sorry Muriel, I am in my car, I am on my way.""

Q. You understand
A. That's what he said to me.

Q. So there is no doubt we have to do this as part of the court procedure. I am suggesting to you that he did not say that at all?
A. That's your suggestion, I am telling you what he said to me on the phone.

Q. And in fact he told you he was ringing about the letter to the ombudsman?
A. No, he didn't mention anything about a letter, he just said he needed to come and see me and Gary and I explained to him that I was at the house on my own and I did not want him to come there.

Q. I am suggesting to you that he did tell you about the letter to the ombudsman and that was a bit shock to you because you didn't know he'd have it?
A. No, I don't think he mentioned anything about a letter."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 315 line 8 to T 316 line 30)

68Mrs Campbell said at the first hearing that not only were Mr Manns and Mr Wells not mentioned, but that the plaintiff did not even mention having the Deputy Mayor with him; the first she knew was when the Deputy Mayor got out of the car (T 317).

69Mrs Campbell made a statement that formed part of the exhibits for the first hearing (Exhibit 5). Significantly, she sets out that the plaintiff said ""I'm in my car on my way to your house to come for a meeting"". The location of being ""in my car"" was inconsistent with the plaintiff's evidence at the first hearing but consistent with his evidence before me, where he agreed that he telephoned her from his car. It is not in dispute that Mrs Campbell told him her husband was not home. What is in dispute is, therefore, whether she told him she did not want him to come, and whether he said he was already on the way and would be there in ten minutes.

70According to Exhibit 5 and to her evidence in both proceedings, she then telephoned her husband at Bermagui Public School, told him the mayor was on the way, and asked him to come home immediately. She asked him to ""Tell Noel Rutherford you can't do the homework centre because I need you here"" (Exhibit 5, paragraph 8). She also rang the defendant and said ""I'd rather if I had someone here 'cause I don't want to be at my house on my own. I asked him to come after Gary got off work, but he told me no, he's coming now."" (Exhibit 5, paragraph 9). Mrs Campbell goes on to say in paragraph 10: ""I was extremely upset and very anxious that I was alone. I was frightened of the Mayor coming when I was alone, I didn't want to be in my house when I was alone.""

71Mrs Campbell's evidence in these proceedings was along similar lines:

""Q. What did he say on the phone?
A. He rang me and I asked him who was it, he said, ""It's me, Tony Allen,"" I asked him what he want, he said in a very scary voice he said to me, I've started carrying on about, ""I want my name retracted,"" I didn't understand what he was saying but it he was carrying on about a letter and I started getting a bit scared because even though I told him I was at my house on my own, my husband was at work, I did not want him to come there, he literally stood over me on the phone and said, ""I'm very sorry but I'm in my car and I am on my way.""

Q. Did you want him to come?
A. No, I did not. 

Q. He mentioned this letter of 22 October, did he?
A. The 26th.

Q. That's the one you wrote to the ombudsman?
A. Yes, it is.

Q. Just before you wrote that letter--
A. Yes.

Q. --you had had home invasion problems, had you?
A. Yes.

Q. With racist youths, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. So you told him you didn't want him to come to the home?
A. No, I did not. Yes, I did, I told him I did not want him to come to my house.

Q. Tell me about his tone of voice.
A. It was very scary, he was actually it's like when you've got somebody telling you what you should do and even if you say no the answer I still, I'm going to do it. It was more of a stand over tactic. I was yeah, I was actually pretty scared because I did not want him to come to my house, I was at my house on my own and I was yeah.

Q. He hung up, did he?
A. No, he kept on carrying on about the letter and, yeah, after I told him I didn't want him, then he told me that he was still coming whether I wanted him not to or not. Yeah, the conversation ended and that's when I contacted my husband.

Q. You contacted your husband--
A. Yes.

Q. --by phone?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you contact anyone else by phone?
A. Yes, Sister Laurel LloydJones.

Q. That's Sister Laurel LloydJones?
A. Yes.

Q. What did you say to her on the phone?
A. I explained to her that I got a phone call from Tony Allen and I told her what had been said on the phone and I told him that I did not want him--

...

Q. Can you do me a favour? Can you pretend I was there and sort of try and recreate the conversation to the best of your ability? So you're saying hello, this is Muriel, and then say what you said to her, can you do that?
A. Yeah, I rang Sister Laurel Lloyd and I Laurel LloydJones, sorry, and I explained to her that I had--

Q. No, you said, hello, this is--
A. ""Hello, this is Muriel,"" and Laurel said asked me was everything okay and I said, ""No, look, I've just received a phone call from Tony Allen and he's demanded that he's coming to my house even though I told him that I was at my home on my own, my husband was at work, Gary, and I didn't want him to come, he still said to me, 'It's too late, I'm in my car, I'm on my way.'""

EVATT

Q. Did you tell her anything about the letter?
A. Yes, he was I told Sister Laurel that he Tony Allen was carrying on about the letter and the only letter that I could think of was the one we had sent to the ombudsman. 

Q. You rang Gary as well?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. What did you say to him? The same or different or--
A. Yes, I told him the same."" (T 232 line 22 to T 234 line 14)

72Mrs Campbell's distress when giving evidence was obvious in the first hearing, where she broke down when describing having to collect her son from hospital after he was injured in the home invasion (T 301); she said ""I don't want to go through this again"". Her level of distress when giving evidence before me was palpable. She nevertheless answered questions directly and frankly, and I was impressed by both her honesty and courage. On leaving the witness box she appeared to collapse and had to be helped to a seat, and it was clear that maintaining her composure had been a strain.

73I acknowledge that the findings in relation to Mrs Campbell during the first hearing are that her evidence as to what happened at the meeting were not accepted. However, that does not prevent me from finding that her evidence of what was said on the telephone is not only reliable but consistent with the changed evidence of the plaintiff, namely that he really was in his car when he telephoned her, and was parked at a short distance from her home.

Mr Campbell

74Mr Campbell gave evidence in the first hearing but was unable to give evidence before me due to a family tragedy requiring his presence in Bermagui. No point is taken concerning his failure to give evidence a second time in these proceedings.

75Mr Campbell worked at the local school, and school hours finish at about 3.30 pm. However, on the day in question, Mr Campbell was working in the after-hours homework centre, which meant that he would not leave school until 5 p.m. Consequently, the inconsistency between the evidence of all the witnesses that these events happened at about 3 - 3.30 pm and the dates recorded on the Deputy Mayor's mobile phone account do not have any impact on whether he was at work or not, because he was working in the after-hours section. 

76Mr Campbell's evidence is in fairly narrow compass. He described what his wife said to him as follows:

""A. Muriel rang me up while I was at work and she sounded a bit stressed and said like ""The mayor is coming and Jeanette Neilson is coming up to see us."" I said, ""oh when"" and she goes, ""They're coming straight away"" and I said, ""Well I'm at work, can you tell them to wait until I come home from work."" She said, ""No, they're on their way."" (T 361)

77Mr Campbell did make these arrangements, and drove home to be present at the meeting. Beyond asking Mr Campbell to confirm that he knew the plaintiff had come about the letter, Mr Connell did not challenge this account of what Mrs Campbell had said.

78Mr Campbell does correct his wife on one detail; she had indeed mentioned the Deputy Mayor, Jeanette Neilson. In addition, it is clear from the conversation that Mrs Campbell did not tell Mr Campbell that she had asked the plaintiff not to come. It was not put to Mr Campbell that he had not wanted the meeting, nor did he volunteer this. He did, however, say that both he and his wife were very stressed because of the home invasion (T 378), that his wife had been particularly affected and became ""terribly distressed"" when called upon to discuss these events (T 373) and broke down during the meeting.

79Mr Campbell's description of the state of stress he and his wife were in is an indication of how powerful the impact of the home invasion had been on them: 

""Q. I am suggesting perhaps
A. No, there was serious other things on her mind than the water hole at the time, you know, just the pressure and stress of what my family went through. The help we were supposed to receive, you know, we didn't receive it. You know, just all sort of things happen that quick, you know, like yes all of my mind is sort of elsewhere, you know? I was worried about other things that happened to my family.

Q. I imagine all the events at the time you were very stressed?
A. Yes, stress and that involved as well.

Q. Stressed and?
A. There was sort of stress involved as well, you know, I was still suffering the things as well, you know, like it was going through my mind, a lot of things.

Q. Yes and I imagine that the events of that night with all that stress and so much happening that at times your memory wouldn't be perfect about things at all?
A. Yes.""

80Mr and Mrs Campbell had suffered a terrifying experience a few weeks before these events. One of their sons had been seriously injured when their home was invaded. Their children, not the invaders, had been charged. They were dissatisfied with the response of police and local government to what they saw as an ongoing problem, and they had written to the Ombudsman. The result had been a telephone call from the plaintiff to advise that he and the Deputy Mayor were in a car a short way from the Campbell home, wanting a meeting which, on any version of these events, was a meeting which was to take place as soon as Mr Campbell could get away early from his school duties.

81The final evidence of relevance is the evidence of the defendant.

The evidence of the defendant 

82The defendant's evidence in the first hearing was as follows:

""Q. Then, further down the page on the lefthand side, ""3.30 pm (approx) phone call from Muriel Campbell asking for us to go to their place in Hill Street"".
A. Yes. 

Q. ""BVSC Mayor Tony Allen has rung her to say that he and deputy mayor Jeanette Nielson were on their way over to their place for a chat.""
A. Yes. 

Q. ""We changed quickly and were there in about 15 minutes. Allen and Nielson were there already sitting in their car. A lengthy - at times very heated discussion took place. Allen and Nielson were there objecting to their being named in the Ombudsman report that Laurel had typed out for the Campbells. By this time Muriel had spelt it out to them in no uncertain terms the treatment that they and other Kooris had received at the hands of police and the louts at Bermagui. They had Tony Allen apologising and promising to now follow, with senior police, the actions of the local police (and this inaction) that have allowed things to get this far.""

A. That's correct.

Q. I suggest to you that insofar as that note records that Muriel Campbell told you that the plaintiff and deputy mayor, Jeanette Nielson, were on their way over to their place for a chat, that that is indeed what Mrs Campbell told you.
A. Most certainly not, but that is what my husband recorded it as. She certainly was not saying it was a chat.

Q. She was saying that the mayor and Mrs Nielson were coming over, wasn't she?
A. She said they were coming. She asked him not to come and he said, ""We're coming anyway. I'm on my way.""

Q. My question was quite simple, wasn't it, it was simply
A. He didn't say, ""A chat.""

Q. You see, Sister LloydJones, in the letter which is the subject of these proceedings when you give an account of the phone call - the account of Mrs Campbell telling you about the phone call, you say nothing, do you, about the plaintiff telling Mrs Campbell he was coming over in the company of Mrs Nielson?
A. She said that he was coming to her house, I don't believe she even knew that Mrs Nielson was coming."" (Transcript before Colexfax SC DCJ, T 513 line 23 to T 514 line 16)

83The defendant's evidence that the plaintiff did not even know that the Deputy Mayor was coming differs from the evidence of Mr Campbell. Given the Campbells' acknowledgement of the impact of stress on their memory, it is more probable than not that the plaintiff said that they were both coming. However, the real issue is not whether the plaintiff was coming alone, but whether Mrs Campbell was upset, scared or frightened by the prospect of the visit and, if so, whether the plaintiff's request for the meeting in these circumstances amounts to conduct which may amount to evidence of truth of the imputations.

84The defendant's evidence in the proceedings before me that Mrs Campbell rang her, sounding as if she was crying and saying:

""A. Sorry. She said, ""Laurel, can you come to my house very quickly. I've had a very bullying phone call from the mayor. He said he's coming straight away because he has a letter and he wants me to retract or something"" she said."" (T 279)

85As she had said in the first hearing, she stopped to change her trousers, as she had been gardening, asked her husband to accompany her, and arrived at the Campbell home about fifteen minutes later, at which time she saw the plaintiff, Deputy Mayor and Mr Manns outside the Mayor's car (T 281 - 2).

86In cross-examination the defendant denied that Mrs Campbell had asked her down just to ""keep her company"" (T 286), saying that Mrs Campbell was afraid (T 290). It was not put to Mrs Campbell that she had asked the defendant to her home only to keep her company.

87Mr Connell's submission is that I should not accept any of the evidence of the defendant because of the adverse findings made against her by the trial judge at the first hearing (T 296 - 8). Nevertheless, he cross-examined the defendant on a number of issues on the basis that these matters went to my findings on credit (T 298), although he restricted the issues in order to preserve his entitlement to rely upon the adverse findings made by the first trial judge. In particular, he cross-examined her (as he had done with Mrs Campbell) about whether the word ""retract"" was used.

88The defendant's evidence on this issue is of marginal relevance. The salient points of her evidence, namely that Mrs Campbell rang to ask her to come to her home immediately, and that the defendant effectively did so, are largely unchallenged, and corroborative of the evidence of Mrs Campbell that she was scared, did not want to be alone when the plaintiff came, and wanted support because she was expecting the meeting to start when the plaintiff arrived, rather than when her husband arrived home from the school. 

89By agreement, the defendant's husband was not called, although the transcript of what he said at the first hearing was tendered. His evidence consists of what his wife told him that Mrs Campbell had said and is of little weight. He made a diary note, about which the defendant was cross-examined in the transcript extract above. His evidence is of limited assistance at best.

The s 25 defence 

90Counsel for the plaintiff provided me with a copy of his written submissions in the first hearing concerning, inter alia, the s 25 defence in relation to each of the imputations. The evidence relied upon for the two imputations concerning the telephone calls is set out in these submissions in a list of transcript references (submissions book, page 119). The plaintiff relies upon this evidence (summarised at submissions book, page 37) as demonstrating that the plaintiff ""did not attend her [Mrs Campbell's] home"", was not aggressive, complied with Mrs Campbell's wishes, and had ""no intention of not complying with her wishes"". Additionally, submissions were made that none of the defendant's witnesses were witnesses of credit (submissions book, pages 115 - 199). 

91Essentially, the same submissions are made again before me, with renewed force, in that Mr Connell submits that I am estopped by the findings of credit made by Colefax SC DCJ as to the lack of credit of the defendant and all witnesses called by her.

92I shall first set out his Honour's findings. At [32]-[33] of his Honour's judgment, Colefax SC DCJ found that after the plaintiff telephoned Councillor Neilson, he telephoned Mrs Campbell and ""told her that he had a letter that he wanted to speak to her and her husband about. Mrs Campbell said her husband would be home at 3 p.m. and asked the plaintiff to wait until then. The plaintiff says he agreed."" His Honour then went on to make findings of fact in relation to the events of the meeting, and at [137] and [138] of his judgment set out the following findings in relation to the defence:

""Substantial Truth/Justification:

137. The test for determining whether an imputation is substantially true is well established:

""The defence depends upon the substantial truth of the defamatory meaning conveyed by a libel. Every material part of the imputations upon the plaintiff contained in the words complained of must be true; otherwise the justification fails as an answer to the action."" (See Howden v Truth & Sportsman Ltd (1937) 58 CLR 416 at 420 per Dixon J.)

138. This defence can be quickly despatched. As I have already found, there was no substantial truth in the publication.""

93At paragraph 2 on page 36 of the plaintiff's written submissions there is a reference to a statement to this effect in Cross v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 80 at [71], noting this test was applied in Herald & Weekly Times Ltd v Popovic (2003) 9 VR 1 at [274]. 

94Colefax SC DCJ's findings in favour of the plaintiff on the s 25 defence were set aside in part on appeal (Lloyd-Jones v Allen [2012] NSWCA 230), for the following reasons (at [32]-[37]):

""[32] Under s 25 of the Act the issue is whether the defamatory imputations are substantially true. Where the defence is pleaded to multiple imputations the court is required to consider the evidence in respect of each imputation in order to determine whether or not the defendant has proved that it is substantially true. In this case, based on the statements in the letter, imputations (a) and (c) concerned the respondent's conduct during the telephone conversation, and imputations (b) and (d) concerned his conduct at the meeting.

[33] The trial judge's finding upon which the defence to all the imputations was rejected was expressly confined to the respondent's conduct at the meeting, and followed a detailed analysis of the evidence of what happened on that occasion. He undertook no analysis of the evidence of, and made no finding as to the respondent's conduct during, the telephone conversation.

[34] Conflicting versions of a telephone conversation was given by both the respondent and Mrs Campbell. The respondent denied that his attitude was over-powering and bullying. He asserted the imputations were false. He denied he told Mrs Campbell he would be coming to her home in 10 minutes, although she had requested him to delay until her husband was there. Mrs Campbell's evidence included the following:

Well I got a phone call from Mr Allen and he asked me if he could come up to my house to have a meeting with me and Gary and I explained to him that I was at the house on my own. I told him I didn't want him to come there because I was just still terrified about what happened and I specifically told him I did not want him to come, I was at the house on my own. But his reply to me on the phone was, ""I'm sorry Muriel, but I am on my way"" and then he hung up. I started to panic.

[35] The appellant gave evidence of Mrs Campbell's distress and anxiety as a result of the conversation.

[36] The issue of the truth of imputations (a) and (c) necessitated resolution of the competing accounts of the telephone conversation, and of the respondent's conduct during it. The trial judge's failure to do so precluded rejection of the defence that these imputations were substantially true.

[37] There was no challenge to the trial judge's conclusion in respect of the respondent's conduct at the meeting, and the consequential rejection of the defence of truth to imputations (b) and (d).""

95The correct approach to the issue of the truth of imputations (a) and (c) involves resolution of the competing accounts of the telephone conversation and the plaintiff's conduct during it. These were findings of fact not made by the trial judge.

96In Howden v Truth & Sportsman Limited (1937) 58 CLR 416, the publication asserted that the plaintiff had been convicted of fraud when the sentence had in fact been quashed. The defence of justification, struck out for the reasons outlined by Dixon J at 420 - 421, related to the proof of falsity of these facts, and not to an imputation which included more than primary fact-finding, namely an assessment of an evaluative nature, required by reason of the terms in which these imputations are expressed. Similarly, the imputations in Cross v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd were allegations of ""ripping off"" investors and employees. 

97The imputations in Herald & Weekly Times v Popovic fell into a different category, in that the imputations pleaded by both the plaintiff and defendant included an imputation of bullying which, in the case of the defendant's imputation, was asserted to be true. The jury rejected the defendant's plea of justification to the Polly Peck (Polly Peck (Holdings) Plc v Trelford [1986] QB 1000) imputations. The very nature of the role of the jury may have meant that, as juries are commonly instructed to do, they brought into their considerations the kind of evaluative assessment that the High Court of Australia, in Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Trad (2012) 292 ALR 192, would direct that judges determining justification defences in relation to imputations of this kind should use.

98Both Colefax SC DCJ and Nicholas JA considered the justification evidence on the objective evidence, where the credit of the witnesses played a crucial role in determining the version of events to be accepted. Mr Connell submits that I should, conformably with the findings by Colefax SC DCJ that the defendant and her witnesses were not persons of credit, not accept their evidence, prefer the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses, and make findings accordingly. This is the course Mr Connell urged upon the Court of Appeal, as his submissions in that Court (as well as to me) make clear.

99The difficulty I have with this course is that, even if I accept the evidence of the plaintiff, the Deputy Mayor and Mr Manns and prefer it to the evidence of the defendant and her witnesses in relation to the issues of fact determined in the first hearing, it is still necessary for me to consider the objective evidence in these proceedings (upon which there was no fact finding in the first hearing) and then to make the judgment of an evaluative nature that the parties agreed, in their oral submissions, is necessary for imputations of this kind, by a careful analysis of the facts found, in the manner explained by the High Court in Harbour Radio v Trad, supra.

100The High Court handed down Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Trad on 5 October 2012, three months after the Court of Appeal's judgment in Lloyd-Jones v Allen, supra, was handed down. In Harbour Radio Pty Ltd v Trad, supra, at [53] - [59], the High Court held that the Court of Appeal had taken an erroneous approach to the justification of imputations which, like the imputations before me, involved more than primary fact-finding, namely that an assessment of an evaluative nature is required by the terms in which the imputations are expressed, as is apparent from their content. The High Court explained this process as follows:

""[53] For its part, 2GB submits that the Court of Appeal was correct in its identification of the right-thinking community member test, but erred in holding that the primary judge had not applied it and, on remitter from this court, itself should apply it.

[54] The invocation of ""right-thinking"" persons as a criterion of the defamatory nature of the matter in question was doubted by Griffith CJ in Slatyer v Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Ltd if it identified anything other than ""a man of fair average intelligence"". More recently, in Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton, French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ disfavoured any additional requirement of ""right-thinking"" and preferred, as the referee of the issue of whether a person had been defamed, an audience composed of ordinary decent persons, being reasonable people of ordinary intelligence, experience and education who brought to the question their general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs. Their Honours added that such a criterion ""may be seen as a benchmark by which some views would be excluded from consideration as unacceptable"". 

[55] A legislative objective of the procedures under s 7A of the 1974 Act was to overcome the complexities said to arise from the common law division of functions between judge and jury. Chesterton concerned the alleged inadequacy of jury directions at the second stage, under s 7A(3), when the jury determined whether the matter complained of carried the imputations and, if so, whether they were defamatory. Under s 7A(4) McClellan CJ at CL alone was required to determine all issues of fact and law relating to 2GB's defences.

[56] Issues of fact upon which a defence of substantial truth turns may present a ready choice for decision by the judge sitting, as did McClellan CJ at CL, at the s 7A(4) stage. But in other cases the imputation may depend upon more than primary fact finding. Upon that factual substratum an assessment of an evaluative nature may be required by the terms in which the imputation is expressed. Imputation (g) is of that character. In such a case the judge should look to the reaction of an audience composed in the manner as described above by reference to Chesterton.

[57] This is not how the primary judge proceeded, nor, having found error by the primary judge, did the Court of Appeal proceed in this way in the determination of imputation (g). Moreover, as 2GB submits, the Court of Appeal misconceived the primary judge's approach to imputations (b), (c) and (d). His Honour's consideration of the application of a test based on community standards was confined to the substantial truth of imputation (g).

[58] The findings by McClellan CJ at CL respecting the views held by Mr Trad on the topics of women victims of sexual violence, homosexuals, Jews, child martyrs, terrorism, Anglo-Irish Australians and Hindus informed his conclusion of the substantial truth of imputations (b), (c) and (d). His Honour found that the communication of Mr Trad's views demonstrated the substantial truth of the imputation that he incites people to commit acts of violence (imputation (b)) and that he is a dangerous individual (imputation (d)). He found that Mr Trad's encouragement of others to share his views demonstrated the substantial truth of the imputation that Mr Trad incites people to have racist attitudes (imputation (c)).

[59] In the Court of Appeal Mr Trad challenged the factual basis of the findings by McClellan CJ at CL: grounds 4-9. His appeal respecting the adverse truth findings succeeded on a ground not taken by him, that McClellan CJ at CL had proceeded on ""a false basis"". In the absence of a notice of contention by 2GB seeking to uphold the findings on any different basis, the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to address the parties' submissions as to the factual basis for them.""

101In Trad v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd (No 2) [2013] NSWCA 477 the Court of Appeal again upheld the defence of justification, but for different reasons as is explained at [64]:

""[64] These conclusions differ in part from those reached by the court in the first appeal. However, with respect to imputations (d) and (g), the findings of the trial judge were rejected because the conclusion appeared not to be based upon the standard of ""right-thinking members of the community"". This court, wrongly as the High Court has held, failed to address the question by reference to the correct test. Further, in order to address the question, it would also have needed to form views about other findings which were not reconsidered. These include the questions relating to further injury to the appellant's reputation by imputations (h) and (k), viewed in the light of the bases on which the contextual imputations have been sustained.""

102Having noted these general principles, I now set out my findings.

Findings of fact

103The above facts set out the background, call content, the timing of the call and the meeting, the persons the plaintiff and Mrs Campbell asked to be present and the reactions of both the plaintiff and the Campbells to the proposed meeting.

104I am satisfied that Mrs Campbell said she was at home alone, indicated she did not want to meet the plaintiff without her husband and that he was still at work, and indicated that she did not want a meeting in her home. When seeking to fix a time to come to her home, the plaintiff indicated not only that he was ""on the way"" but that he was in his car, in the sense of being a very short distance from her home, having driven from Bega for that purpose. I am also satisfied that, this being the case, he said he wanted to have the meeting by using the language of immediacy, as opposed to being prepared to wait for Mr Campbell to finish work. Whether he actually said ""in ten minutes"" or some other time period, he was asking for a meeting as soon as possible. I also find that, either expressly or impliedly, he indicated that he had driven to Bermagui for this purpose and wanted the meeting to take place, and was prepared to push this point over the reluctance of Mrs Campbell who, I accept, did not want to have a meeting, and certainly not one at such short notice. 

105I am satisfied that Mrs Campbell's state of mind was that she was ""scared"", not only by his call and the prospect of an imminent meeting with the plaintiff and with the Deputy Mayor without someone to support her, but also by the prospect of the plaintiff having some issue with the Campbells' letter to the Ombudsman, and that this was why she wanted a support person. There is no dispute that Mrs Campbell was not told that either Mr Mann or Mr Wells was invited, and I find she rang the defendant because she wanted a support person present (and not just for company, as Mr Connell submits). 

106Whatever the timing of the telephone call and meeting (and I note the conflict between the telephone records and all of the witnesses on this issue), I am satisfied that Mr Campbell had to leave the school early to attend the meeting, and that his consent to the meeting was not sought by the plaintiff. 

Conclusions concerning imputation (a) 

107Imputation (a) is that the plaintiff conducted himself inappropriately as Mayor in that he bullied a woman. Given the limited parameters of fact finding, I take into account the circumstances of the telephone call which are in evidence before me, but I also note the findings of fact adverse to the defendant and her witnesses as made by Colefax SC DCJ in the first hearing.

108Before applying the community standards approach explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Trad v Harbour Radio, supra, I should consider whether the facts without that evaluative test are sufficient. 

109The plaintiff, a high official, telephoned a woman he had met once before, who had been the victim of a frightening home invasion a matter of weeks before, wanting to meet her and her husband at their home more or less straight away. Although the plaintiff's explanation was that he was puzzled by the Campbells' complaint, it is clear he wanted to discuss a letter of complaint she and her husband had sent to the Ombudsman, the contents of which he thought were inaccurate. He gave no notice of his intention until he arrived a short distance from their home, such as to amount to very little notice to Mrs Campbell, and no notice at all to Mr Campbell, who was not at home. At T 219 the Deputy Mayor stated that it was inappropriate to go to someone's home without notifying them; I consider that the degree of notice given to the Campbells of this meeting was so insufficient as to amount to an inappropriate lack of notice, particularly given the subject matter of the visit. 

110Mrs Campbell said in cross-examination that the reason she rang the defendant was that the plaintiff spoke to her in an ""inappropriate"" way, ""bullying me on the phone"" (T 245). I am satisfied that she felt bullied, and that she was entitled to feel this way by reason of the contents of the call, as set out above.

111However conciliatory the plaintiff may have been at the meeting (for example, he comforted her by putting his arm around her when she started crying), this meeting was doomed from the start by the inappropriate way that it was set up. The plaintiff should not only have consulted both Mr and Mrs Campbell about such a meeting, but inquired what support persons they might want, and told them that he intended to bring Mr Manns and Mr Wells. Indeed, Mr Manns said he would only attend if the Campbells wanted him to do so, and the plaintiff's failure to tell the Campbells that Mr Mann was coming is an indication of the hasty and inappropriate way that this meeting was planned, as is the late arrival of Mr Wells. These findings of fact support a finding in favour of the defendant as to the defence of justification for this imputation.

112As to the principles set out in Trad v Harbour Radio, supra, I note Mrs Campbell's response that the circumstances of the plaintiff's call ""would be enough to scare anyone"" (T 245). However, that is not evidence of community standards, and I have disregarded it.

113Applying community standards to the findings of fact set out above, a visit by a senior official such as the Mayor to the home of someone he had met once before, for the purpose of discussing a complaint made about him to the Ombudsman, would be enough in itself to be bullying conduct. For a senior official, or a police officer, or a politician to go to the home of someone who has made a complaint about them, however misguided or wrong that complaint may be, is conduct which by community standards would be inappropriate, especially if the official in question had only a brief professional acquaintance with the complainant of the kind that was the case here. The fact that the meeting was arranged at such short notice was also inappropriate, particularly since Mrs Campbell was not told that the plaintiff was bringing support persons. The presence of the Deputy Mayor would not have made the visit any the less alarming. Also of relevance to community standards would be the vulnerability of the Campbells as the victims of a frightening home invasion a matter of weeks before, in which racial tensions appears to have been a feature. No matter how conciliatory and friendly the plaintiff may have been at the meeting (and I note the findings of Colefax SC DCJ in favour of the plaintiff), the manner in which it was set up on the telephone would be, from the viewpoint of community standards, inappropriate in that it was bullying conduct to have set up the meeting in this fashion.

114The defendant accordingly succeeds in relation to the defence of justification to this imputation.

Conclusions concerning imputation (c)

115Imputation (c) is that the plaintiff intimidated a woman by acting in a bullying and overpowering manner over the phone. The findings of fact made in the first hearing are of less relevance to this imputation, because of the specificity of the reference to the conduct being ""over the phone"".

116The findings I have made in relation to bullying for imputation (a), both on the facts of the case and by applying the test set out in Trad v Harbour Radio, supra, apply to this imputation as well. 

117The remaining issue is whether the plaintiff's behaviour was overpowering. Having regard to the findings of fact set out above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff, having come to a spot very near the Campbells' home without arranging an appointment, was not prepared to drive away without having a meeting. Both on the objective evidence of the facts, and having regard to community standards, conduct of this kind by a public official such as the Mayor is overpowering.

118The defendant accordingly succeeds in relation to the defence of justification to this imputation.

119The plaintiff is entitled to damages in relation to imputations (b) and (d). In addition, in the event that I have erred in my findings in relation to the defence of justification, I have considered damages issues on the basis that all four imputations are conveyed.

Damages

120I first set out the manner in which the task of assessing damages in this rehearing must be approached. In Lloyd-Jones v Allen, supra, at [86] - [87], Nicholas AJ stated:

""[86] In my opinion:

(1) The defence of qualified privilege in respect of publication to the Committee should be upheld;

(2) The defences of qualified privilege in respect of the publications to the news desk of ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" and to Sarah Curnow from Four Corners were not established;

(3) The defences of comment and honest opinion were not established;

(4) The defence of truth of imputations (a) and (c) was not decided. It remains open in respect of the publications to ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" and to Sarah Curnow from Four Corners.

[87] These conclusions necessitate the setting aside of the award of damages. The respondent's claim for damages will depend on whether or not the appellant establishes the defence of truth to imputations (a) and (c) in respect of the publications to ""The Sydney Morning Herald"" and to Four Corners. There should be a new trial limited to these issues.""

121Both the plaintiff and the defendant submitted that, rather than attempt to tailor the assessment of damages made in the first hearing (which included not only the imputations the subject of this judgment, but the additional publication to the committee members), I should approach the assessment of damages afresh. 

122The issues which fall for consideration are:

(a)The purposes of an award of damages in defamation: Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 90 at [73] - [74] per Macfarlan JA. This includes the correct approach to the evidence of hurt to feelings, the seriousness of the allegations and the nature of the publication;

(b)The appropriate principles to apply where the extent of publication is limited: Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd [2014] QCA 33 and the appropriate discount to apply where one or more of the imputations pleaded was proved to be true: Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd, supra; Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 770; Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [64] - [77];

(c)The plaintiff's claim for aggravated compensatory damages;

(d)Matters raised in mitigation of damages, including publication of an apology and evidence concerning the failed plea of justification (Holt, supra at [26] - [32]).

General considerations

123The purpose of an award for damages for defamation is threefold: reparation for harm done, consolation for personal hurt and distress, and vindication. In determining the damages to award, the court must ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the harm sustained by the plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded, and assess an amount for general damages in accordance with the cap on damages (s 35(1) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)). However, that cap does not include aggravated compensatory damages: Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [41].

124To recover damages, a plaintiff need not call witnesses to say that following publication they thought less of the plaintiff: Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166; Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2009) 238 CLR 460 at 466 - 67. The plaintiff in these proceedings did not call any such evidence. However, that does not preclude the plaintiff from an award of damages, as damage is presumed.

125Where a plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation for a limited publication such as the present, that brings the publication into the public domain. This is in addition to the ordinary ""grapevine"" effect and should be taken into account when awarding damages: Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [35]. 

The evidence in relation to damages

126The evidence in relation to damages in these proceedings must commence with the evidence of the plaintiff as to his own hurt to feelings.

127The plaintiff is a well-known and widely respected member of the Bega Valley Shire community whose role in local government over a lengthy period and good reputation was the subject of evidence by the Deputy Mayor (T 199), Mr Constance (T 138 - 9), Mr Cruse (T 43 - 48) and Mr Manns (T 223). Mr Constance, a Minister in the NSW Government, described him as having ""enormous commitment and passion about the Bega Valley"" (T 139) in local government and government circles generally.

128The plaintiff's evidence was that he found the publication gut-wrenching, and that he had to continue with the case because there was no other way to restore his reputation (T 88, 108 - 9). He had brought these proceedings to defend his integrity, which he considered had been challenged both by the Campbells' letter to the Ombudsman in 2006 (T 52) and by the matter complained of, which repeated these false claims. When the defendant publicly advertised for funds to conduct her defence and used an illustration of the three wise monkeys in the advertisement, this ""basically gutted me as a person"" and he ""just couldn't describe to the court"" the depth of his feelings (T 8882). Mr Connell draws to my attention that this sensitivity to the funding advertisement illustrated the plaintiff's fragility and how difficult the process of going through this litigation had been for him. He had been placed under great pressure in going through this litigation.

129Evidence of this kind is generally given in defamation proceedings; its absence may be an occasion for remark: Ell v Milne (No 8) [2014] NSWSC 175. Such evidence should be viewed in the context of the facts of the case.

130The plaintiff's demeanour in the witness box was that of a confident and successful businessman, with long experience in local government. Although he spoke of distress, the impression with which I was left was that he was angry, first that the complaint had been made to the Ombudsman in 2006, and then that these claims, as well as a description of his subsequent meeting with the Campbells, had been repeated to the Premier of New South Wales and to the media in the matter complained of. 

131The circumstances in which the matter complained of was written are self-evident from its contents. That document is the key to the factual issues in this case. The matter complained of outlines the circumstances in which the Campbell family had been the victim of a series of incidents including a home invasion and, most recently, an assault, over a three-year period. The principal concern of the letter to the Premier is the conduct of the police over this period. The references to the plaintiff are at paragraphs 12 - 14 and relate to the history of the Campbells' requests for assistance rather than to conduct warranting investigation as part of the conduct of police. 

132The first issue is the question of the seriousness of the imputations. This is often a question of degree as well as context. Imputations of criminal conduct are at the highest level of seriousness. Imputations of personality defects, such as selfishness, arrogance or bullying, tend to fall at the lower end. All of the imputations pleaded fall into this category.

133The first task I have is to assess what the damages would have been but for the mitigating effect of two of the imputations being substantially true, this being the course taken by Margaret Wilson J in Hallam v Ross (No 2) [2012] QSC 407 and approved by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [66]. Margaret Wilson J found that damages would have been assessed at $20,000 were it not for the mitigating effect of two of the imputations being substantially true. The two imputations, which were serious, contributed to the hurt and distress of the plaintiff but after allowance for their mitigating effect, damages were reduced to $12,000. A similar course was taken in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, and by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal in Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 770 and Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 90.

134This brings me to the manner in which the discount should be applied. Each of the plaintiff and defendant took an extreme position. The plaintiff submitted that no discount should be made at all. The defendant submitted that contemptuous damages of the lowest coin in the realm should be awarded. 

The impact upon damages of partial success under s 25 

135First, I note that where a defendant has not entered a plea of justification, evidence of the truth of the defamatory statement is not admissible in order to mitigate damages: Middendorp Electric Co Pty Ltd v Sonneveld [2001] VSC 312 at [273] per Gillard J. However, where evidence introduced in support of justification partially justifies one or more of the imputations pleaded, the award of damages should be mitigated accordingly: Associated Newspapers Ltd v Dingle [1962] 2 All ER 737; Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd (No. 2) [1988] 1 All ER 282 at 287 per Neill LJ, cited in Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd & Anor v Campbell [2002] EWCA Civ 1143 at [30]; Li v Herald and Weekly Times Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 109 at [89]; see also Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 631 at [296]. 

136The submission by the plaintiff that no discount in damages should occur is inconsistent both with the authorities set out above and with Besser v Kermode [2011] NSWCA 174. In holding that the provisions of s 26 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), prevented the ""pleading-back"" of the defendant's imputations, McColl JA (at [86]) stated that a defendant seeking to justify defamatory matter under the 2005 Act could ""to the extent that the defendant fails to establish all the defamatory imputations carried by the defamatory matter of which the plaintiff complains are substantially true, rely on those proved to be true in mitigation of the plaintiff's damages: partial justification"". The NSW Court of Appeal has explained and applied these principles in Holt v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 770. At the time these proceedings were heard, the Court of Appeal had not yet handed down its judgment dismissing the appeal, and the correctness of Adamson J's approach (relied upon by Mr Evatt, but challenged by Mr Connell) has been endorsed.

137Mr Connell's reliance upon Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law & Practice (LexisNexis) at [22,115]) to assert no deduction should be made is also misconceived. This section relates to issues of mitigation of damages and to the warning given by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Mahommed (2010) 278 ALR 232 at 287 that the principles enunciated in Burstein v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 1 WLR 579 should be approached with caution, as its applicability under Australian law was still undecided. These principles would not in any event be relevant where a defence of justification has been partially successful. 

138This brings me to Mr Evatt's competing submission, namely that damages for the remaining two imputations should be reduced to a ""vanishing point"" (Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd (No. 2), supra) and an award of what Mr Evatt called ""nominal damages"" of only five cents ($0.05) be made. 

139Although Mr Evatt categorised such an assessment as ""nominal damages"" (referring to the famous one farthing damage awards in Kelly v Sherlock (1866) LR 1 QB 686 and Dering v Uris [1964] 2 QB 669), awarding the lowest coin in the realm is in fact a contemptuous, rather than a nominal, award of damages: Brown on Defamation, 2d (Thomson Reuters) at [25.7] at fn 2031 and [25.8]; Pamplin v Express Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1988] 1 All ER 282 (one halfpenny); Bailey v Truth and Sportsman Ltd (1938) 60 CLR 700 (one farthing). Mr Evatt has confused these two different kinds of damages awards.

140Despite the cap on damages under the uniform legislation being designed to mirror similar capped damages legislation, awards of nominal damages are rare, and contemptuous damages non-existent. The only award described as nominal damages under the uniform legislation is the damages assessment in Beaven v Fink [2009] NSWDC 218, where $2,500 was awarded for a slander to one person (affirmed in Fink v Beaven [2010] NSWCA 92). The damages award of $4,500 for the mass media publication in Holt, supra, was referred to by the trial judge as an amount which was ""slightly, but not substantially, more than derisory"" (at [54] and [62]) and by Macfarlan JA as ""undoubtedly small"" ([2014] NSWCA 90 at [76]). 

141Holt is an important decision on these issues, but care must be exercised, as this was an award of damages for a mass media publication, and the substantial truth defence succeeded in relation to the defendant's contextual imputations. The awards of damages in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, and in Hallam v Ross, supra, are a more reliable guide, since both awards are made for non-media publications of a limited nature, where a defence of justification has succeeded in relation to certain of the plaintiff's imputations.

142The publication was made to the two named journalists and the news organisations for which they worked. I take into account that there was coverage, in the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 March 2009, of the circumstances in which the Campbell family was assaulted for a second time on January 1, 2009, which referred to the defendant's letter to the Premier about this (Exhibit 7). However, there is no reference to the plaintiff or to any of the events the subject of this litigation, as Mr Evatt pointed out.

143In Hallam v Ross, supra, Margaret Wilson J concluded that a similarly limited publication, of imputations of a more serious nature, warranted an award of $20,000 (reduced accordingly to $12,500). The Queensland Court of Appeal in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, similarly considered that limited publication of imputations of a more serious nature warranted an award of $20,000 (reduced accordingly to $15,000), although aggravated compensatory damages were also included.

144Taking into account the lower level of seriousness of the imputations in these proceedings, an appropriate award of damages for all four imputations is $10,000. For the reasons explained by Applegarth JA, it would be erroneous to apply a 50% discount because two of the four imputations have been established to be true. While there is a degree of overlap and similarity between the language and content of the imputations, the imputations relating to the events at the meeting are of slightly more weight, and the reduction for the imputations which relate more to the contents of the telephone conversation should accordingly be less than 50%. I accordingly propose to award the sum of $6,000 general damages.

145In the event that I have erred in holding that the defence of justification is made about to the two imputations the subject of these proceedings, the amount that I would have awarded would be $10,000.

146In assessing this sum, I have not made allowance for the other bases upon which the defendant relied in relation to mitigation of damages. I note that, in the course of the hearing, I refused to allow the defendant to lead evidence of the plaintiff's bad reputation. This was firstly because the defendant had specifically abandoned any such plea, in the course of pre-trial correspondence and, secondly, because the evidence of mitigation was not in the relevant sector of the plaintiff's reputation: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v McBride (2001) 53 NSWLR 430 at [22].

147The second issue raised as mitigation was the ""apology"" offered by the defendant to the plaintiff in court. The text of the 20 July 2010 apology was:

""On 7th February 2009, I Sister Laurel Lloyd-Jones, made statements about the Mayor, Councillor Anthony Allen.

My intention was not to hurt Mr Allen but to stand up for the truth and in support of my clients, the Campbell family.

If Mr Allen has suffered as a result of my statement in regard to his actions, then I extend my compassion and sorrow for his suffering as this was genuinely not my intention.

The stating of what I believe to be the truth holds a most fundamental importance in my life from which I cannot defer.""

148The contents of this apology, and in particular the last paragraph, fail to acknowledge any of the elements of the plaintiff's claim and come close to amounting to a repetition of the libel.

149The next issue for determination is the question of aggravated compensatory damages. Although Mr Evatt appeared to submit that aggravated damages could not be awarded where a defence of partial justification succeeded, such an award was made in Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra (at [76]). 

Aggravated compensatory damages

150For an award of aggravated damages it must be demonstrated that the impugned conduct was lacking in bona fides or improper or unjustifiable in all the circumstances: Triggell v Pheeney (1951) 82 CLR 497 at 514 per Dixon, Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ.

151The plaintiff relies upon the written submissions made at the first hearing in seeking an award of aggravated compensatory damages . The written submissions provided to Colefax SC DCJ identified (at pages 28 - 31) seven bases for seeking such an award:

(a)The defendant's failure to inform the plaintiff of the allegations before publishing the matter complained of. 

(b)The defendant's knowledge of the falsity of the allegations

(c)The defendant's failure to apologise, the ""apology"" given in court being a maintaining of the truth of the libel. 

(d)The defendant's conduct in taking part in interviews about the litigation: Ali v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 183 at [79] - [85].

(e)The defendant's conduct in putting on the record defences of truth and contextual truth, and bad reputation, and maintaining these: T&S 22-035 and 22-075. In particular it was submitted that the contextual imputations were false and ""over the top"". I note that the claim of bad reputation was abandoned before the trial. 

(f)The conduct of the case by the defendant's legal representatives, including calling the case an abuse of process and ""even going to the point"" (submissions, page 30) of suggesting to the plaintiff in cross-examination that he brought these proceedings to shut the defendant up, and that his bringing of the claim was bullying (at T 161). I note the same matters were put to the plaintiff in his cross-examination in these proceedings.

(g)A general submission that ""the conduct of the defendant in aggravating damages should push the award to the very top of the range"".

152The most significant basis for the claim is that made for the failure of the defence of justification to imputations (b) and (d), coupled with the withdrawal of the contextual justification defence. This must be addressed on two bases:

(a)That the plea of justification succeeds for the two imputations the subject of these proceedings; and

(b)That the plea of justification has failed for all four of the imputations.

The unsuccessful plea of justification to two (or all four) of the imputations and the abandonment of the contextual truth defence 

153Colefax SC DCJ awarded aggravated compensatory damages of $15,000 in relation to only one of the issues in Mr Connell's list, namely the making of a plea of contextual truth. No award was made for the failure of the s 25 defence.

154His Honour stated at paragraphs [151] - [152]:

""151. Those are disturbing assertions. The plaintiff was clearly and visibly upset when taken to them during his evidence in-chief. My assessment of the plaintiff is that such a display of public emotion was highly unusual for him and extremely embarrassing.

152. The defence of contextual truth was not withdrawn until the defendant commenced her submissions on 23 November 2010. It was submitted that they had to be withdrawn because of the implications flowing in the decision of Kermode v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited [2010] NSWSC 852 decided 4 August 2010. However the defendant permitted the pleading to remain on foot for almost four months and caused the plaintiff considerable anxiety leading up to the trial and in his evidence. This is a case which clearly calls for aggravated damages because of the way in which the litigation was conducted. The allegations in the pleadings were in my view totally unreasonable and without foundation. I award aggravated damages in the sum of $15,000.00.""

155In Ell v Milne (No 8) [2014] NSWSC 175 at [89]-[90] McCallum J declined to award aggravated compensatory damages for a defence of justification withdrawn during the hearing, as well as for contextual imputations struck out in an earlier argument:

""[89] ... The plea of justification, withdrawn well before the final hearing, is a factor capable of increasing the injury to Mr Ell's reputation. The pleading of the defence may have extended the ""vitality"" of the defamation in the sense considered by the majority of the High Court in The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd v McGregor (1928) 41 CLR 254 at 263. Equally, the contextual imputation alleging electoral fraud, which was struck out before trial, was in my view unjustifiably maintained and may have increased the effect of the libel.

[90] However, I am not persuaded that the degree to which those factors have in fact aggravated the injury to the plaintiff's reputation is more than very slight. I accept, as submitted by Mr Tobin, that those are matters which have been put on the record and which remain on the record in a formal sense ""for many moons"". However, the matter has not received the kind of attendance in the public gallery as in some cases over which I have presided. There was no evidence of its having been reported. In my assessment of the circumstances of this particular case, I doubt whether the conduct of the defence in this litigation would have received any serious attention in any person's assessment of Mr Ell's reputation.""

156A pre-trial ruling on the contextual imputations in these proceedings was deferred by consent, as the parties were waiting on the Court of Appeal's decision in Besser v Kermode (2011) 282 ALR 314. The contextual imputations were abandoned during submissions, but the gap between the hearing and submissions was no fault of the defendant.

157Assuming some, or even all, contextual imputations had been struck out, the fact that excessively highly pleaded imputations are drafted is not uncommon in defamation litigation and should not be, without more, a basis for the award of aggravated compensatory damages. The robust but reasonable defence of proceedings, including a plea of justification which fails, does not permit an award of aggravated damages; it is the pleading and persisting in a defence of truth without a proper basis which does: Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [38]. 

158The award of aggravated damages for the failure of the plea of justification to imputations (b) and (d), if seen in context with the success of imputations (a) and (c), would be difficult to justify in terms of the factual overlap of the four imputations. If I have erred in relation to those findings, I would still not have awarded aggravated damages, both for the reasons enunciated by McCallum J in Ell v Milne (No 8), supra, and because of the strong evaluative nature of the sting of the imputations. The defendant was present at the meeting, and was told about the phone call; no matter how poor her credit may be as a result of the findings of Colefax SC DCJ, her conduct lacks the necessary elements for such an award. I note that Colefax SC DCJ did not make such an award either, confining his comments to the impropriety of the pleaded contextual truth imputations.

The remaining grounds for the claim of aggravated compensatory damages

159The other bases for the claim are failure to inquire and knowledge of falsity, failure to apologise, conduct of the case and the fact that the plaintiff took part in an interview.

Failure to inform and knowledge of falsity

160Whether the relevant conduct warrants such an award will depend on the circumstances of the case: Australian Defamation Law and Practice at [22,045] and [22,060]. In Ell v Milne (No 8), supra, McCallum J noted:

""Ms Milne's alleged recklessness in publishing the matter complained of without making inquiries as to the truth of the imputations is not logically a factor that aggravates injury to reputation - the letter says what it says.

Ms Milne's failure to make enquiries of Mr Ell prior to publication ""as a consequence of which the matter complained of came to his notice without forewarning"" is a factor which might have aggravated the injury to Mr Ell's feelings but it is not logically capable of aggravating injury to reputation.""

161The same reasoning should be applied here. This is a long letter that, similarly, says what it says, and the failure to make inquiries is not logically capable of aggravating injury to reputation. Similarly, the plaintiff's knowledge of the falsity, even if applied to all imputations rather than two, is not logically capable of aggravating hurt to feelings, given the evaluative nature of the imputations.

162Mr Connell submitted that the findings of fact at the first hearing warranted an award of aggravated compensatory damages and has referred to evidence of the plaintiff's asserted improper motives, which led Colefax SC DCJ to make a finding that she had been actuated by malice. I first note that, when awarding damages, s 36 requires the court to disregard the malice or other state of mind of the defendant except to the extent that the malice or other state of mind affects the harm sustained by the plaintiff. While malice or reckless indifference does not warrant an award of aggravated damages of itself, the plaintiff's awareness of the defendant's state of mind may aggravate the hurt to feelings: Cerutti v Crestside Pty Ltd, supra, at [40]. However, the Court of Appeal in Lloyd-Jones v Allen, supra, set aside the trial judge's findings as to the defendant's malice.

163While I am constrained by the findings of fact of the first hearing in relation to the imputations to which the defence of substantial truth has failed, I am of the view that each of the plaintiff's claims for aggravated compensatory damages is not made out on any of these bases.

Failure to apologise

164Damages may be increased by an unjustifiable failure to apologise, but this will depend upon the circumstances, including whether an apology was sought and, if no apology was sought, whether the failure was lacking in bona fides, improper or unjustifiable: Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Fitzpatrick [1984] 1 NSWLR 643 at 659 - 60. The mere absence of an apology is not sufficient: Shepherd v Walsh [2001] QSC 358 at [69]. In Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (1992 - 3) 178 CLR 44 at 66 Dean, Dawson and Gaudron JJ commented that they had ""difficulty in understanding how the mere absence of an apology can aggravate damages... No doubt want of an apology may be a relevant factor in establishing that the defendant is motivated by a desire to injure the plaintiff but that does not mean that want of apology itself aggravates the plaintiff's injury"".

165The plaintiff's solicitors' letter of 3 March 2009 (Exhibit E in the first hearing) did not provide the text of an apology, but required the defendant to submit ""the draft of a clear and unqualified apology and retraction, to be approved by Mr Allen, for publication to the same persons who received or viewed the matter complained of."" However, this letter went much further. It also sought payment of an unspecified sum ""in lieu of the damage that has been caused to his reputation and as compensation for his hurt to feelings"", an acknowledgement that the defendant had been engaged in a vindictive and unjustified campaign and a demand that she ""immediately cease and forever desist"" from defaming the plaintiff, plus payment of ""reasonable legal costs"".

166In Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203 at [44] - [47] the Court of Appeal analysed a letter in very similar terms, including wide-ranging reference to other publications, which put the defendant in an invidious position, and which meant, ""more insidiously"" (at [47]), that if she had made the apology, she may have been making admissions about other matters. In addition, as is the case here, the making of the apology did not guarantee a response that no proceedings would be taken; similarly, the plaintiff in these proceedings (see Exhibit E) was also seeking an unspecified amount of damages. The Court in Jones v Sutton (No 2), supra, concluded that the request for apology was ""unreasonable"" (at [67]) and unlikely to promote a resolution of proceedings. In fact, so unreasonable was the apology that it was one of the factors rendering the proceedings an ""exceptional case"" in relation to the indemnity costs order which would otherwise have been made: at [41] - [42].

167 Conformably with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton (No 2), I do not propose to award aggravated compensatory damages under this head. 

Conduct of the proceedings

168In the first hearing, aggravated damages were sought on the basis of remarks made by Mr Evatt to the effect that these proceedings were an abuse of process. It is clear from the context that Mr Evatt was not indulging in abusive language, but referring to the well-developed body of law in the United Kingdom consequent upon Jameel v Dow-Jones Inc [2005] QB 946, analysed in more detail by Basten JA in Bristow v Adams, supra, at [35] - [41]. While those principles are not the law in Australia, it is acceptable for counsel to refer to them.

169Mr Connell also complained about statements Mr Evatt made during the trial about the strength of his case, the weakness of the plaintiff's case, including some muttered comments he states Mr Evatt made which should have appeared on T 36 (but did not), adding that ""your Honour may well remember it"" (written submissions, paragraph 11(c)(iii)). These exchanges are part and parcel of the combative litigation on both sides, and I do not propose to regard these exchanges as a basis for the award of aggravated damages (or for the mitigation of damages: T 163 - 6).

170I reject the plaintiff's submissions that an award of aggravated compensatory damages should be made.

171The issue of aggravated compensatory damages has been considered on the basis that I have erred in my findings as to justification of imputations (a) and (c). These submissions would have even less force if my findings on the s 25 defence to these two imputations is correct. 

172The award of damages for the plaintiff in relation to imputations (b) and (d) is $6,000. At the request of the parties I have reserved the issues of interest and costs.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $6,000.

(2)Liberty to apply in relation to interest and costs.

(3)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		24 April 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2763721,Mitchell v R [2014] NSWCCA 63,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  Allan James Mitchell (""the applicant"") applies for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Robison in the District Court at Moree on 27 March 2013.
2The applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of break and enter with intent to steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in company with two other persons (his younger brothers). He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years dating from 12 September 2012.  In respect of this sentence, the applicant becomes due for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 11 September 2014 (but he is serving other sentences I will refer to later).
3The offence is contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.
4Taken into account at the applicant's request were two further offences listed on a Form 1 document:  larceny and take and drive a conveyance.
Extension of time
5The applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal but it expired before the applications for leave to appeal and for an extension of time were filed on 30 January 2014. 
6The applicant is legally aided.  It was necessary to have counsel's advice that the proposed appeal had merit before it could proceed.  The reason advanced for the matter being out of time is stated to be:  ""Counsel advised that, given the Applicant's brothers the two co-accused's appeal had been set down for hearing, it was advisable to await the determination of their matters before determining the question for merit for the applicant"".  It is said that it was through oversight that the Notice of Intention to Apply for Leave to Appeal was allowed to lapse.
7The more desirable course would have been for the applicant's matter to be brought on in a more timely fashion and for it to be heard and determined at the same time, and by the same bench, as the co-offenders' appeal. Nevertheless, there is nothing to suggest that the applicant himself was at fault and so I propose that an extension of time be granted.
Facts
8The applicant's younger brothers, Michael Mitchell and Paul Mitchell were also sentenced by Robison DCJ on the same occasion.  In my judgment in the determination of their appeals to this Court (Mitchell v R; Mitchell v R [2013] NSWCCA 318) I set out the facts as follows (with some additional matters specifically relevant to the present applicant interpolated):
""[7] Michael Mitchell was aged 19 at the time of the offences and Paul Mitchell was aged 22.  Together with their brother Alan, aged 40, they set out on a journey from Tumut to Queensland, ostensibly for Alan to seek employment opportunities.  
[8] On 11 September 2012, on the Newell Highway near Gilgandra they stopped at the access road to a rural property where a work vehicle was parked.  Together they stole a tool box from the rear of the vehicle. It contained two chainsaws and various other tools and implements, altogether worth about $1250.  I interpolate that these items were ultimately recovered.  This constituted the offence of larceny that was taken into account.
[9] The offenders continued their journey north and when about 40km south of Narrabri their vehicle broke down.  They eventually managed to get a lift into Narrabri.  At some point that night they were walking past the premises of an audio-electronics business.  They noticed a Toyota Landcruiser parked in the yard.  They entered the yard where Alan Mitchell broke into and started this vehicle.  The applicants got in and the trio proceeded back to where their car had broken down.  The car was towed back into Narrabri and the stolen car was dumped on the outskirts of the town.  The applicants being passengers in the stolen car constituted the other offence that was taken into account. [Alan Mitchell was the driver and this constituted his offence of taking and driving a vehicle without the owner's consent.]
[10] The offenders then decided to return to the audio-electronics business in order to break in and steal tools and music equipment.  They entered through a hole in the fence earlier made by Paul Mitchell.  They forced open a garage door.  Michael and Paul Mitchell entered the building with the intention of stealing but an alarm was activated and all three fled the scene.
[11] The three offenders were arrested on the morning of 12 September 2012.  They were taken to the Narrabri police station where it is said that they were co-operative with investigators and made full admissions.  
[12] Compensation was sought by the prosecution for the damage occasioned to the stolen car.  Payment was proffered by way of a solicitor's trust account cheque at the sentence hearing. [The money was derived from the proceeds of sale of Alan Mitchell's vehicle.]
[13] In assessing the seriousness of the primary offence (the aggravated break and enter with intent) the judge noted that there was 'no real degree of planning' and that it was 'somewhat spontaneous'.  His Honour posed for himself the question 'whose idea was it' and answered it by saying that, because of his age, Alan Mitchell had to take 'considerable responsibility'.
[14] The judge concluded that the objective seriousness of the primary offence was 'within the lower end of the range'.  This had been conceded by the solicitor appearing for the Crown.""
Personal circumstances of the applicant
9The applicant was aged 40 at the time of sentence.  The learned sentencing judge described him as ""no stranger to the criminal justice system"".  He has a very lengthy criminal history that commenced in 1986 in the Children's Court.  There have been numerous offences of dishonesty, including car theft and the breaking or otherwise entering of premises and stealing.  But he has also diversified into the cultivation and supply of drugs, escaping from lawful custody, assault (including the occasioning of actual bodily harm), intimidation, damaging property, and possessing unregistered or unauthorised firearms.  There are many driving offences as well.  He has been imprisoned on multiple occasions. In fact, a considerable part of the applicant's life for the past 20 years has been spent in gaol. Parole revocation is also a feature of the record.  
10The applicant left school at the age of 14 or 15.  He then obtained occasional seasonal work.  The judge noted that the applicant had undertaken a number of labouring jobs in the past and was a qualified floor and wall tiler.  He said in his evidence that he sustained a back injury from an early age and subsequently suffered from severe pain.  The judge also noted that the applicant spoke of having had problems with drugs in the past and had been diagnosed with Hepatitis C which he had acquired during an earlier period in custody.
11The judge also noted that the applicant had described having a very strict upbringing that included the infliction of corporal punishment in a severe way.  His Honour had no doubt that the circumstances of the applicant's younger years were ""not easy for him"".  
Personal circumstances of the co-offenders
12Michael Mitchell was aged 20 at the time of sentence and was single with no dependents.  He was an itinerant tree surgeon.  He had a criminal history consisting of a number of matters dealt with in the Children's Court and one matter in the Local Court disposed of by way of fine in March 2012.  He had not previously been held in custody.
13Paul Mitchell was aged 22 and was also single with no dependents.  He too was an itinerant worker.  He had a criminal history of similar dimensions to that of his younger brother.  It was his first time in custody as well.  
14Robison DCJ was mindful of the relative youth of the two co-offenders.  He described them as being ""very young men"" who had ""their whole lives ahead of them"" and that ""rehabilitation [was] in their hands"".  His Honour allowed for a longer parole period on the basis that this would ""provide a better opportunity for eventual reintegration into society in the hope that their long term futures can be addressed by appropriate forms of counselling and rehabilitation under supervision"".
Matters applicable to each offender
15The judge was mindful of the need to take into account the additional offences on the Form 1 document in relation to each of the offenders, noting that he ""should not pay mere lip service"" to them.  
16The judge was also mindful of the principle of parity, given that he was sentencing the three offenders in the one sentencing exercise.
17Each of the offenders had pleaded guilty at an early stage and the judge reduced their sentences by 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas.
Disposition of the appeal of the co-offenders
18The appeal in Mitchell v R; Mitchell v R was allowed on the basis that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  The primary offence was found by the judge to be ""at the lower end of the range"" of objective seriousness.  It was noted on the appeal that it, and the offences taken into account, were committed by young men who had not previously experienced a custodial sentence.  Sentencing statistics, whilst not determinative, were regarded as providing broad support for the conclusion of manifest excess.  
19The view was taken that the appropriate starting point for the sentences of the co-offenders should have been one year, rather than the three years adopted at first instance.  Reducing that by 25 per cent yielded at total term of 9 months.  The finding of special circumstances made by the primary judge was maintained.  In the end the co-offenders were re-sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months.
Grounds of appeal
1. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive. 
2. Given the sentences imposed upon his two co-offenders as a result of their successful appeals (Mitchell v R; Mitchell v R [2013] NSWCCA 318) the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance:  Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 610.
20In the applicant's case, in contrast to the case of his co-offenders, the argument in support of the ground of manifest excess is less powerful.  He could not call in aid youth or lack of a significant record of previous convictions.  While the primary judge found that the offence was at the lower end of the range, it needs to be borne in mind in the applicant's case that he was the senior and more influential participant out of the three.  Having regard to his prior record, specific deterrence required particular emphasis.  General deterrence was obviously important as well.
21There is force in the submission advanced by the Crown that the yardstick against which the sentence falls to be assessed is not the sentencing statistics but the maximum penalty provided by Parliament of 14 years.  In addition, there is the need to reflect in the sentence an appropriate increment for the offences taken into account.
22Nevertheless, having regard to the finding of lower level objective seriousness made by the primary judge, a matter conceded by the Crown in the Court below and not challenged here, I am of the view that the starting point of four years before taking into account the utilitarian value of the applicant's early plea of guilty is manifestly excessive.
23The upholding of ground 1 means that ground 2 does not require determination but it is necessary in re-sentencing to bear in mind the sentences imposed by this Court upon the two co-offenders.  It was not contended that the applicant should receive the same sentence as they did.  It was conceded that it should be higher by an appropriate proportion to reflect his greater moral culpability and less favourable subjective features.  I propose a sentence of 2 years 6 months that will be reduced by 25 percent on account of the applicant's early plea of guilty.  The non-parole will be reduced to reflect the primary judge's finding of special circumstances.  There will be some rounding to achieve a practical outcome.
24Finally, the applicant, like his brothers, was subsequently sentenced for a variety of similar offences to substantial terms of imprisonment.  He is now the subject of sentences that see him ineligible for parole release until 11 March 2017 with the total term not expiring until 11 September 2018.  Those sentences have no bearing upon the disposition of the present application but I note that the degree to which they were made partially concurrent has the effect that the applicant has only been in custody for the present matter alone for a period of 10 months.
Orders
25I propose the following orders:
1. Extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal granted. 
2. Leave to appeal granted.
 3. Appeal allowed.
4. Sentence imposed in the District Court on 27 March 2013 quashed. 
5. In lieu, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of the term of the sentence of 10 months. The sentence is to date from 12 September 2012.  The non-parole period expired on 11 September 2013 and the total term will expire on 11 July 2014. 
26DAVIES J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
27ADAMSON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763727,Jawish v R [2014] NSWCCA 62,"Judgment

1R A HULME J: Kassar Jawish (""the applicant"") applies for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against his conviction for an offence of disposing of property stolen outside New South Wales committed at Kingsgrove on 22 February 2010. The offence is contrary to s 189A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 

2The applicant was found guilty of this offence following a short trial before his Honour Judge Woods QC and a jury in June 2011. On 25 November 2011 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. He became eligible for release on parole last December.

Extension of time

3Section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides for the filing of a notice of intention to appeal, or to apply for leave to appeal, within 28 days after the relevant conviction or sentence. That time may be extended. Such notices have effect for a period of six months and there is provision for that period to be extended: r 3A of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). A notice of appeal, or notice of application for leave to appeal, must be filed within three months after the relevant conviction or sentence or, if a notice of intention is current, then within the period in which that notice has effect: r 3B.

4In the present case, nothing was filed until the applicant filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal on 4 November 2013. It was accompanied by a Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Leave to Appeal and an affidavit sworn by his solicitor. 

5What emerges from that material by way of explanation for the delay is that it was ""more than a year after the conviction"" that the applicant initiated action to seek legal aid to fund the provision of advice as to whether an appeal would have merit. Such advice was not forthcoming until early in 2013. From that point until the filing of the applications in November, various lawyers (by no means with any apparent alacrity) carried out an assortment of tasks such as obtaining missing items of transcript, securing legal aid funding for the appeal itself, and preparation of the appeal documents.

6There is cause for concern at the time taken by the lawyers to provide advice about an appeal and then to prepare and file the appeal papers. But a more fundamental concern is the absence of any attempt to explain the inactivity of the applicant in doing anything to pursue an appeal for more than a year.

7In Simon v R [2013] NSWCCA 328, Macfarlan JA referred to the approach to be taken in the determination of an application to extend time as follows:

""[23] The specification of time limits for the pursuit of appeals is based upon the principle of finality, described by the plurality in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; 223 CLR 1 at [45] as 'a fundamental and pervading tenet of the judicial system'. In considering whether an extension of time should be granted, it is not only the interests of the applicant for leave that must be considered. Regard must be had to the interests of the Crown (representing the community) and to the administration of justice generally (Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [39]). The longer the delay, the greater will be the justified expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over (ibid at [38]). In considering whether to grant an extension, the Court has regard to the applicant's prospects of success on an appeal but should do so in a more summary fashion than if the applicant had brought an appeal or application for leave to appeal within time (Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262 at [24] - [25]; Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [35]; and see generally Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [22] - 33]).""

8In Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311, another recent case in which an extension of time was sought, Leeming JA made the following terse (appropriately so in my respectful view) observations about the need for respect for the principle of finality:

""[11] This is not an appeal, and should not be resolved as if it were. It is an application for a substantial extension of time within which to appeal from the applicant's conviction, which was opposed by the Crown principally on the basis that cause to do so had not been demonstrated. ...

[22] This Court is required to heed time limits which are, after all, imposed by the Legislature. There must be an end to litigation, even to a serious criminal prosecution.""

9Leeming JA also explained the rationale for dealing with an application for an extension of time ""in a more summary fashion"" than if an application for leave to appeal, or appeal, had been brought in time:

""[31] ... If that were not so, the time limits imposed by the Legislature would become entirely otiose.""

The Crown case at trial

10The applicant was tried jointly with one Samer Youssef Ibrahim. It was alleged that they were both involved in the enterprise of disposing of a large quantity of biscuits that had been stolen in Queensland by delivering them to the business of Safira Trading Pty Ltd at Kingsgrove.

11The Crown case at trial was largely circumstantial. It included the following elements.

On Thursday 18 February 2010, Mr Ibrahim's sister-in-law hired a white Toyota Tarago motor vehicle.

A large quantity of biscuits was stolen from a trucking company depot at Rocklea in Brisbane in the early hours of Saturday 20 February 2010. Two men were captured on CCTV cameras in and around the depot at the time of the theft. A white Tarago was also seen in the vicinity of the depot at the time. The Crown suggested that the jury might conclude from the CCTV footage that this was the same white Tarago hired by Ibrahim's sister-in-law but this was not critical to the success of its case.

Sometime on that same day, a 12 tonne Isuzu truck was borrowed from a trucking firm in Sydney. It was returned late the following night but the owner of the firm was told that the truck would be required again the following morning. The owner said that he was unaware whether the truck was loaded with anything when it was returned to his yard.

On the morning of Monday 22 February, the owner of the trucking firm received instructions to send the Isuzu truck, with a driver, to Kingsgrove. He complied.

At 7.40am, the white Tarago and the Isuzu truck were seen outside the premises of Safira Trading in Kingsgrove. An officer from the Property Crimes Squad, Detective Sergeant Don, was there conducting surveillance. He saw a man sitting in the driver's seat of the Tarago. 

A short time later Sergeant Don saw the Tarago moved into a car park at the front of the premises while the Isuzu truck was reversed down the driveway of Safira Trading. Shortly after that he saw two men, including the driver of the Tarago, standing at the back of the Isuzu truck as a forklift truck was unloading it. He said that the two men appeared to be assisting with the unloading. 

The Isuzu truck was driven away from the premises about an hour later. A little more than an hour after that the two men who had apparently been assisting with the unloading returned to the Tarago and drove away.

The Tarago was next seen by another police officer about 35 minutes later. It was parked near the home of the applicant. 

Around midday, the Tarago was returned to the business from which Ibrahim's sister-in-law had hired it. It had travelled 2,846 kilometres in the four days it had been on hire, consistent with it having been driven to the scene of the theft in Brisbane and back. 

The stolen biscuits were subsequently found by police on the premises at Safira Trading.

12To establish that the two accused were the men in the Tarago who had been involved in unloading the stolen biscuits at Safira Trading, the Crown relied upon the following evidence.

Ibrahim's sister-in-law had hired the white Tarago.

Sergeant Don was familiar with the appearance of the two men because their photographs were posted on a whiteboard in his office; along with those of a number of other persons suspected of such crimes. (The jury only heard that he had photographs in his office). He said that the two men he saw at Safira Trading were ""similar"" in appearance to the applicant and his co-accused.

The Tarago was parked in the vicinity of the applicant's home a short time after it had left the scene at Safira Trading.

13The Crown also relied upon some direct evidence. Another police officer recorded some moving images of the two men at Safira Trading. The Crown case was that a comparison of those images with footage of the two accused recorded at a police station after their arrest demonstrated that they were the same.

Proposed ground of appeal

14The proposed ground of appeal is in the following terms:

The trial judge erred in law by declining to exclude the purported visual identification evidence of the appellant and is co-accused by the prosecution witness Det Sgt Don for three reasons:

(a) That is was reasonable for police not to have conducted an identification parade;

(b) That Sgt Don was sufficiently qualified as a de facto expert;

(c) That in all the circumstances the probative value of Det Sgt Don's identification evidence was not outweighed by the danger or unfair prejudice to the appellant.

15Mr Wendler, counsel for the applicant now but not at trial, abandoned reliance upon sub-grounds (a) and (b) from the outset of the hearing of the application. He accepted that (a) was untenable in the light of Walford v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2012] NSWCA 290 in that it would have been impracticable (in fact impossible) for there to have been an identification parade prior to Sergeant Don recognising the applicant at Safira Trading. Sub-ground (b) was abandoned with a concession that Sergeant Don's evidence was not ""opinion"" evidence. That left Mr Wendler with sub-ground (c).

16The problem with sub-ground (c) is that it was founded upon a miscomprehension of what actually occurred at the trial.

17The Crown Prosecutor proposed to lead from Sergeant Don that he positively recognised the two men at the premises of Safira Trading. Counsel for each of the accused objected. The objection was based upon the same three issues reflected in the expression of the proposed ground of appeal.

18Woods DCJ acknowledged the force of the argument that had been put in relation to there having been no identification parade but accepted the Crown submission that any identification parade conducted after the identification made at Safira Trading would have yielded evidence of dubious reliability and evidence of it would likely have been ruled inadmissible at trial. (It is noted that consideration of the issue was contrary to what was said in the subsequent decision in Walford, but nothing presently turns on that).

19His Honour was not entirely convinced but was prepared to accept that the proposed evidence was ""opinion evidence"". On the basis of Sergeant Don's frequent viewing of the photographs in his office he was prepared to accept that he was an ""ad hoc expert"".

20However, his Honour then turned to the third point concerning s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). He indicated that he was troubled about the reliability of the evidence (for reasons which are presently irrelevant). He considered that the probative value of the evidence was ""limited"" and it was outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice (although there was no elucidation of what the unfair prejudice was). He concluded:

""Accordingly I rule that the witness will not be permitted to give evidence of positive identification or recognition of the accused as persons [sic]. However the familiarity of the witness with the photographs on the whiteboard would justify evidence that the two males observed on 22 February 2010 (one or both of them) was or were similar to the photographs which the witness had previously seen. That is to say, I will permit the giving of evidence of observed similarity but I will not permit the giving of evidence as to identification or recognition of the whole person.""

21The proposal that the officer might give evidence of ""similarity"" originated from his Honour. It did not emanate from anything that had been suggested by the Crown Prosecutor or defence counsel in their submissions on the objection. His Honour directed the Crown Prosecutor to provide to his opponents a proof of the evidence that Sergeant Don may give in the light of his ruling. It is not apparent whether this was done, although there was no complaint about it not having been done. 

22A jury was empanelled on the next sitting day and the trial proceeded. Sergeant Don's evidence about the similarity of the two men at Safira Trading to the photographs of the applicant and his co-accused was exceedingly brief. It entailed the following (at the beginning of the second day of his evidence):

""Q. Going back to some of the material that we covered yesterday, you told us that you saw the two men that ultimately got into the Tarago and drove away from the premises. You saw them on a number of occasions that morning about the premises of Safira Trading?
A. That's correct.

Q. You told us that you observed that each of the two men that you saw were similar to photographs of the accused that you had in your office.
A. I haven't said that as yet.

Q. Is that the case?
A. Yes, it is.""

23There was no dispute or challenge to the reliability of that evidence during the cross-examination of the officer by either defence counsel. Counsel for the applicant made a submission in his closing address to the jury that Sergeant Don was mistaken in his evidence, but he later readily conceded to the trial judge that he had not put such a suggestion to the officer and he had no qualms about the judge telling the jury that ""the undisputed evidence is that there was similarity"".

24In his summing up, the judge reminded the jury of the evidence of Sergeant Don about ""similarity"" in the context of directions about the reliability of evidence of identification. He first discussed various matters the jury should take into account when comparing the surveillance footage of the two men at Safira Trading with the footage recorded of the accused at the police station after their arrest. He then turned to the evidence of Sergeant Don. He reminded the jury that it was not positive identification. He reminded them that the evidence was uncontested. He directed them that ""mere resemblance or similarity is not of itself sufficient to prove the Crown case"", but was simply a circumstance that could be considered alongside all of the other circumstances.

25The judge then reminded the jury of various aspects of Sergeant Don's evidence which may bear upon the reliability of his observations; matters such as the distance from which he was observing and the like.

26Finally, the judge directed the jury that no adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that Sergeant Don had photographs of the applicant, and his co-accused, in his office. He suggested there could be all sorts of reasons for police having photographs of people, such as for drivers' licences and fishing licences.

Disposition of the application

27As can be seen from the above, the trial judge upheld the objection to Sergeant Don giving evidence that he recognised the applicant and his co-accused but suggested that he could give evidence of similarity. Neither defence counsel thereafter complained about the nature of the evidence Sergeant Don would give, or then did give.

28No complaint was raised about the manner in which the trial judge directed the jury; particularly as to the warning he gave not to draw any adverse inference from the fact that the police had photographs of the two men.

29The submission of Mr Wendler that there was unfair prejudice was limited to matters such as a danger that the jury would find that the evidence supported other items in the Crown's circumstantial case. There is nothing unfairly prejudicial if the combined force of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown was enhanced: see, for example, Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at [91] (McHugh J); and Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [22] (Gleeson CJ) and [51] (McHugh J). 

30It was also mildly suggested by Mr Wendler that the evidence might prompt the jury to give more weight to other circumstances in the Crown case than they properly deserved. Why the jury would reason so illogically was not explained.

Conclusion

31It is most unfortunate that Legal Aid NSW has devoted precious resources to funding this application which, in the end, was conceded to involve ""a technical point"". In my view, it is a point that is completely devoid of merit. There is not the slightest hint of a miscarriage of justice having occurred.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763728,R v McKellar (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 453,"Judgment

1On 24 February 2014, at the end of a special hearing conducted in Bathurst, I found that, on the limited evidence available, Shane Thomas McKellar (to whom I shall refer as ""the offender"") committed two extremely serious offences: R v McKellar (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 107. The first offence was an armed robbery with the infliction of really serious physical injury upon the victim. The second was murder. In each case, the offence was committed on 21 May 2011 in the township of Bourke. And in each case the victim was Bruce Wentworth Delany, to whom I shall usually refer in these remarks as ""the deceased"".

2The maximum penalty for that form of aggravated robbery is imprisonment for 25 years. The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life without possibility of parole. I regard each of those maximum penalties as important guideposts that inform the exercise of my discretion today.

Review of legal context

3As a result of those verdicts, it now falls to me to impose a limiting term with regard to each of those offences. It is appropriate at this stage to explain briefly the legal process in which I am engaged.

4Some time ago, the offender was judged to be unfit to stand trial. That was due to his mental condition, a topic that I shall discuss in more detail later in these remarks. The result was that, rather than standing his trial by jury with regard to the two offences, a special hearing by judge alone was conducted before me. The purpose of that hearing was to determine whether, in truth, the offender committed those crimes, rather than to determine his guilt of them in the usual way.

5Those verdicts having been returned by me, the law requires me to indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment: s 23(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act""). I indicate immediately that that is unquestionably the case with regard to both offences.

6Having come to that view, I am required to nominate a term with regard to each offence, that being my ""best estimate"" of the head sentence that I would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial that had ended with verdicts of guilty: s 23(1)(b) of the Act. After I have nominated the limiting terms, I am required to refer the offender to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal""), and make such orders about the custody of the offender as I consider appropriate: s 24 of the Act. It is not my role to impose a non-parole period, or anything analogous to it.

7As a result of the imposition of those limiting terms, the offender will become a ""forensic patient"": s 42 of the Act. The period of the longest limiting term is the maximum period during which the offender may be detained as a result of his commission of these offences. The Tribunal, in the years ahead, may release the offender before the expiry of the limiting terms that I set. However, it must not do so unless it is satisfied, on the evidence before it, not only that less restrictive care which is safe and effective is appropriate and reasonably available, but also that the safety of the offender or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release: s 43 of the Act.

8It is in that context that I turn to consider the facts of the matter. In accordance with well-established principle, I need to be satisfied of any aggravating feature that I take into account against the offender beyond reasonable doubt. I need only be satisfied of a mitigating feature in his favour on the balance of probabilities. It may be that some facts will be unable to be determined with clarity by me.

Aspects of the offending

9My reasons for verdict of 24 February 2014 provided an extensive review of the evidence with regard to the commission of the offences. For that reason, I shall not traverse the facts again at that level of detail. It suffices to say that, in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 21 May 2011, the offender was roaming the streets of Bourke with a young female companion. They were in search of prohibited drugs. Some months before, the offender had remarked to that young lady that he wished to break into the home of the deceased. The deceased, aged 81 years, was living alone in his home at 16 Becker Street Bourke. He was known to the offender because the aunt of the female companion of the offender lived next door to the deceased, and the offender had been to the aunt's home on many occasions.

10The offender travelled on foot to the home of the aunt. He was alone. There he armed himself with a knife, a golf club, and a pair of scissors. He also disguised himself by placing a mask that had a wig attached to it over his head. All of those items were available to him in those premises. He did those things because he had decided to commit an armed robbery upon the deceased. His motive was to obtain cash that he could use to purchase prohibited drugs. It is noteworthy that the offender took steps not only to disguise himself but also to ensure that he did not leave body samples such as fingerprints or DNA at the scene of the crime. Those steps included wearing gloves on both hands, and wrapping a piece of cloth around the handle of the knife and around the handles of the scissors.

11The deceased was at home alone that morning. The offender broke in and demanded money. The deceased complied and gave the offender a $50 note. The offender replied ""I don't care, I'm still going to kill you"". A struggle ensued, during which the offender inflicted a cut to the area of the right ear of the deceased, an injury to his left ear, and a small wound to the lower part of the breastbone of the deceased. There was at least one wound inflicted to a hand of the deceased that was in the nature of a defensive injury. Most importantly, the offender stabbed the deceased three times to the abdomen. Of those three wounds, the most serious was approximately 12 cm deep. No doubt the infliction of those wounds was a terrifying and exceptionally painful ordeal for the deceased.

12After those acts of violence, the deceased was able to make his way to the home of a neighbour. Thereafter he received a great deal of medical treatment. Tragically, Bruce Delany passed away in hospital on Monday 23 May 2011.

13The armed robbery with infliction of really serious physical injury was made out by way of the behaviour of the offender that I described a moment ago. The murder was made out when the deceased died as a result of that conduct.

14After stabbing the deceased repeatedly, the offender fled. In fact, the $50 note that was the fruit of the robbery was left behind in the backyard of the deceased. As he escaped, the offender was seen by two young boys who were in the vicinity. The offender noticed one of the boys looking at him, and said to him ""Don't look"".

15The offender returned to the home of the aunt next door. He took the time to secrete the gloves and the knife inside wall cavities in those premises. He then ran to another home in Bourke.

16There he asked an acquaintance to drive him to yet another home. Later, the offender persuaded another person to drive him from Bourke to Narromine. Whilst being driven towards that township, the offender said to his companions ""I stole all the money and I stabbed the old man, I'm in big shit"". At the same time he requested the two of them to provide false evidence for him. The offender engaged in all of that behaviour with the intention of evading detection and punishment for what he had done.

17The offender was arrested in Narromine that evening. He engaged in a recorded interview with police in which he put forward various preposterous explanations for a number of pieces of incriminating evidence. He has been in custody ever since.

18None of those matters were in dispute at the special hearing. Nor were they in dispute in the subsequent proceedings. One matter remains in dispute and requires determination by me.

19In my reasons for verdict at the end of the special hearing, I indicated that I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of the stabbing the offender intended, at the least, to inflict really serious physical injury to the deceased. I now need to determine whether I am satisfied that, above and beyond that state of mind, the offender intended to kill the deceased. As I have said, before that could be used against the offender in these proceedings, I would need to be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt.

20The Crown invited my attention to the words said by the offender, and submitted that they are strongly suggestive of an intention to kill. The Crown also submitted that those words need to be seen in context; namely, they were said by a man who had armed himself with a knife in order to commit an offence against an elderly victim, and the speaker was holding the knife at the time.

21Senior counsel for the offender invited my attention to the evidence that the offender was suffering from a serious mental illness at the time, a proposition that is not in dispute. She submitted that his mental illness would have interfered to some degree with the offender's reflection upon, and appreciation of, the consequences of his actions. She also submitted that statements of intention to kill can sometimes be made without being meant literally, especially in situations of heightened emotions. Finally, she submitted that it is clear from all of the evidence that the wounds, including the fatal wounds, were inflicted in the course of a heated struggle, rather than in a cold-blooded and precisely executed series of acts.

22I have reflected on this question at some length. Ultimately, I have come to the view that, taking into account all of the evidence, and in particular the mental illness of the offender, although I strongly suspect that the offender intended to kill the deceased, I am not satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. It follows that the limiting term for murder will be imposed on the basis that the offender repeatedly stabbed the deceased, and at that time the offender intended to inflict really serious physical injury upon him.

23I turn to assess the objective seriousness of such behaviour. An elderly man was robbed in his own home. He was repeatedly stabbed to the abdomen and died as a result. The motive for the robbery was undoubtedly a selfish desire to obtain a paltry sum of money for prohibited drugs. The crime was preceded not only by a degree of forethought, but also planning, the gathering of weapons, and the taking of steps to evade detection. Afterwards steps were taken to conceal the instruments of crime, to flee the vicinity, and to suborn false evidence. Meanwhile the deceased, gravely wounded, was heartlessly left to die by the offender as he made good his escape.

24Objectively, this aggravated armed robbery and murder cannot be assessed as anything other than extremely grave.

Aspects of the offender

25Turning to subjective matters, the offender is an Aboriginal man now aged 35 years. At the time of the offences he was aged 32. It seems that he has lived in the Bourke district all his life. Although it was submitted that his upbringing and background have been deprived ones, there was scant evidence in support of that proposition. It was chiefly based on the contents of some remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Norrish QC from 2008. Having said that, the Crown did not dispute that I should approach the matter on the basis that the offender has led a life completely free from privilege and indulgence. 

26The offender comes from a family of four sisters and one brother. At school he was a below average student, he exhibited behavioural problems, and left in year eight. He has enjoyed few opportunities to work due to his limited education and low intelligence, a topic to which I shall also return. He has four children who would now be aged between 15 and 16 years. By the time of the offences he had become isolated from his family. That was due to his behaviour as a result of his mental condition, no doubt exacerbated by his long-standing abuse of prohibited drugs. In light of the joint position of the parties, I proceed on the basis that this man has led a life that has been under-privileged; indeed, deprived. 

27At the special hearing, the offender was not, of course, able to plead guilty to the offences. But his counsel did not seek to persuade me that the evidence did not establish each offence. The only matter that was in dispute was whether or not the applicant was guilty of constructive murder or murder based upon an intention to inflict (at least) really serious physical harm. As I have said, I resolved that question at the end of the special hearing by finding the latter proven beyond reasonable doubt.

28In the proceedings after verdict the parties relied on two reports: a report of Dr Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, of 3 April 2014, and the latest report of the Tribunal, dated 26 March 2014. 

29In the report of Dr Allnutt it is said that the offender, although claiming to have no memory of the offences, has recently expressed regret for what he has done. That is in the context, of course, of the offender having sought to escape punishment for his crimes very shortly after he committed them, and there being no evidence before me of the slightest expression of contrition before the one that was recently made to the psychiatrist.

30Whilst I have borne in mind the restriction contained in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), I consider that I should proceed on the basis that the offender has come to the position of having some sense of the enormity of what he has done, and having some degree of regret for it. I do not consider that the position can be stated more highly than that.

31It is not disputed between the parties that the level of intellectual functioning of the offender is quite low. The latest report of the Tribunal makes reference to the ""intellectual impairment"" and ""reduced intellectual capacity"" of the offender. The Annexure to the latest report states that the offender is below average intelligence, with previous testing indicating that his full scale IQ falls in the ""mildly retarded"" range. The ""limited intellectual capacity"" of the offender also receives passing mention in the report of Dr Allnutt. Such an assessment is certainly consistent with his appearance and demeanour in the recorded interview with police at Narromine, which was played before me in the special hearing.

32Having said that, his level of intellectual functioning did not stop the offender, in contrast to many other offenders, from taking quite thoughtful precautions against leaving scientific evidence at the scene of the crimes that he proceeded to commit. 

33In short, my limiting terms reflect the reduced level of intellectual functioning of the offender to a small degree.

34By far the most important subjective feature is a chronic mental illness from which the offender suffers. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has suffered from a serious mental illness for many years; that he was suffering from it at the time of the offences; that he was untreated at the time; that he continues to suffer from it; and that he will do so for the rest of his life. Again, the Crown Prosecutor did not place those propositions in dispute.

35Based on the combined effect of the reports of Dr Allnutt and the Tribunal, I am satisfied that the offender suffers from a chronic psychotic illness in the form of schizophrenia. It manifests itself by way of, amongst other things, auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions and ideas of reference such as that a television is speaking to him personally. At the time of the offences, as I have said, the offender was living in the community and was neither taking medication nor receiving any other form of psychiatric help. And, as I have said, no doubt his condition was made markedly worse by his ingestion of prohibited drugs.

36I accept that the ongoing mental illness of the offender makes him a less appropriate vehicle for the expression of general deterrence than he would otherwise have been if he were completely mentally well. I consider that personal deterrence should play a somewhat reduced role as well. My limiting terms will reflect that fact.

37On the other hand, it is to be recalled that senior counsel for the offender did not submit that the illness of the offender was directly linked to the commission of the offences. It is not the case, for example, that command hallucinations ordered the offender to rob and stab the deceased. Nor is it the case that the offender possessed some delusional belief that the deceased was seeking to harm him, or anything of that nature. The most that can be said is that the mental illness of the offender disinhibited him to some degree, and also led him not to fully appreciate and reflect upon the consequences of his actions. Again, it is to be borne in mind in considering this factor that he took steps before and after the offending in order to avoid detection and punishment.

38In short, whilst I accept that the roles of general and personal deterrence are reduced in this case, those factors can by no means be disregarded entirely.

39Turning to the criminal record of the offender, it began in 1991 when he was aged 13. On that occasion he was dealt with in the Bourke Children's Court for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing. Thereafter, he has committed a number of offences that were dealt with by way of bonds, fines, and short periods of imprisonment. It is noteworthy that the offender has repeatedly committed offences of violence, and been imprisoned for them. Having said that, there is force in the submission of his counsel that, save for one matter, none of the matters in his criminal past were judged to be of sufficient seriousness for them to be dealt with other than in the Local Court.

40The one exception is an offence of armed robbery with wounding. It was committed in May 2006, and the facts that were placed before Judge Norrish on sentence were tendered before me in these proceedings. To state matters simply, whilst armed with a metal star picket, the offender entered a hotel in Bourke. He demanded that a cash register be opened by the proprietor. When that gentleman replied that it could not be opened, the offender used his weapon not only to strike the surface of the bar of the hotel, but also to strike the proprietor on the right hand, causing wounds. Thereafter he swung the weapon again at the victim, striking him on the left shoulder. The offender eventually obtained a different cash register from an adjacent bottleshop and fled with it.

41What is immediately noteworthy is that the victim in that matter was aged 85 years. His 71-year-old wife was also present, as were two elderly male patrons. As a result of those facts, I enquired of the learned Crown Prosecutor whether it was his submission that I should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender has demonstrated a pattern of targeting victims who are vulnerable because of their advanced age. In light of the fact that only two such incidents are apparent, the Crown Prosecutor did not make any such submission, and accordingly I do not make any such finding.

42In July 2008, Judge Norrish sentenced the offender for that offence. His Honour took into account that, despite the fact that at that stage the offender had been found fit to stand trial, there were clear signs that he was suffering from a mental illness. His Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years six months, to commence on 13 June 2006. Accordingly, the head sentence for that offence expired on 12 June 2011. 

43It can be seen therefore that, at the time of this armed robbery and murder of an 81-year-old man in his own home, the offender was on parole for an armed robbery with wounding of an 85-year-old man in his own business premises. I regard that state of affairs as a very serious aggravating feature of this matter.

Prospects for the future

44As for the future, it seems that the offender has settled to some degree over the years since he was originally detained with regard to these offences. It seems that he is now engaging well with mental health staff in prison, and is compliant with regard to his medication. Since his incarceration the offender has stopped using prohibited drugs and alcohol, and Dr Allnutt has expressed the view that he is now in remission from Substance Dependence Disorder. The Tribunal report states that although the offender continues to experience hallucinations, and has of late suffered some deterioration in his condition due to the stress occasioned by these court proceedings, there has been ""good improvement"" in his mental state. 

45Dr Allnutt in his report states that the offender understands that he has a mental illness, and accepts the need for medication. Further, the offender appreciates that prohibited drugs and alcohol exacerbate his illness, and he has expressed an intention to pursue drug and alcohol rehabilitation.

46It is proposed by the Tribunal that the offender remain in a stable environment within the prison hospital in the MRRC at Silverwater. Dr Allnutt has proposed that a different antipsychotic medication be trialled. He is also of the opinion that the offender must see a psychiatrist indefinitely. That eminent forensic psychiatrist is of the view that whether the offender is in a prison or is eventually released from detention, he should remain in a hospital environment.

47It appears that the offender's family are supportive of him, and that his parents continue to visit him in gaol.

48Now that the offender has settled into a therapeutic environment; is compliant with his medication; is no longer in a position to consume prohibited drugs; and is no longer in a position to inflict severe violence upon members of the community, I possess a degree of optimism with regard to an improvement in his mental health, and his rehabilitation generally, over the years ahead.

Various matters

49Due to the fact that s 54D(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is clear that the system of standard non-parole periods does not apply to the process of setting limiting terms, I have not taken into account the applicable standard non-parole period for each offence.

50I do not propose to state mechanistically the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I consider that these remarks on sentence fulfil that role. 

51The Crown did not dispute that the limiting terms should commence on the date upon which the offender first came into custody with regard to these offences: s 23(5)(a) of the Act. That position was adopted despite the fact that the offender has served two months or so of balance of parole since that time.

52Nor did the Crown submit, in light of the substantial legal and factual overlap between the two offences, and the inevitable length of the limiting term with regard to the murder, that there was any need for accumulation as between the two terms: s 23(5)(b) of the Act. I have accepted that submission.

53It follows that each limiting term will commence on 22 May 2011. 

Victim impact statements

54Although there is no statutory provision whereby victim impact statements can be received in proceedings for the imposition of limiting terms, senior counsel for the offender did not object to the receipt of five such statements by me. In those circumstances I was content to receive them.

55One such statement was poignantly read by the daughter of the deceased, Ms Sue Delany, in open court. Four more, from his daughter Ms Lynne-Marea Delany, his brothers Mr Lyle Harvey Delany and Mr Brian Desmond Delany, and his sister Ms Wendy Delany were received as exhibits and read by me privately.

56It is clear that at the time of his death Mr Bruce Delany was a much-loved father, brother, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He was a man of modest means who enjoyed the simple pleasures of life, such as a yarn with an old friend and a cup of tea. The attendance at his funeral demonstrated the high regard in which he was held by members of the Bourke community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous.

57Many persons have suffered grievously as a result of his violent death. The wounds inflicted by the offender upon the deceased that morning are by no means the only wounds that have been suffered. Ms Sue Delany has felt guilt that she was unable to protect the deceased. But that guilt is thoroughly misplaced, for the simple reason that only one person is responsible for the violent death of this elderly man in his own home.

58On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend to all those who have loved and lost the deceased my sincere condolences for his passing. Nothing that occurs today can make good that loss, although it could be that the end of these proceedings, almost three years after the fatal crime, could provide a degree of closure. I have dealt with the victim impact statements in accordance with the well-established principles that govern their receipt after a trial.

Conclusion

59In short, the offender committed a premeditated robbery of an elderly man in his own home by way of the use of a deadly weapon. The offence developed into a brutal murder. Steps were taken both before and after the offending to escape detection. The criminal record of the offender featured offences of violence for which he had been imprisoned. At the time the offender was on parole for an armed robbery with wounding that bore a marked similarity to the fatal offences. To be balanced against those reprehensible aspects of the matter is the fact that the offender is a person who has, in some measure, accepted responsibility for what he has done; has suffered a deprived upbringing; is intellectually deficient to some degree; and was and is suffering from a severe mental illness. The limiting terms that I shall impose in a moment seek to balance all of those aspects of the matter. To be clear, were it not for the powerful subjective case, the limiting terms would have been substantially longer.

Imposition of limiting terms

60Stand up please Mr McKellar.

61Shane Thomas McKellar, with regard to the offence of armed robbery with infliction of grievous bodily harm, I impose a limiting term of 9 years, to date from 22 May 2011 and expire on 21 May 2020.

62With regard to the offence of murder, I impose a limiting term of 22 years, to date from 22 May 2011 and expire on 21 May 2033.

63I refer the offender to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

2763731,Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment] 
On 5 April 2012, the applicant, Mr Elturk, pleaded guilty to the offence of stealing a knife contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 117 and to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33(1)(a). 
The Crown applied to the District Court to reject those pleas on the basis that a more appropriate outcome would be a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1900, s 38. This application was supported by expert evidence that the defence of mental illness was open to the applicant. The trial judge rejected that application.
The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years, with a non-parole period of 4 years. In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge considered that because the applicant had chosen not to avail himself of the defence of mental illness, the applicant's mental condition was not to be taken into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. 
The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence. The Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. 
Held per Beazley P (RA Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing):
(1) Although the applicant's plea of guilty precluded his mental illness from absolving him of criminal responsibility, the applicant had not waived his right to have his mental illness considered as a causal factor in the commission of the crime. His mental state at the time of offending was relevant to the assessment of his moral culpability and the objective seriousness of the offence: [33]-[35].
 Applied: McLaren v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [27]-[29] Considered: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120; The Queen v Mooney (Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978, unreported); R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67.  
(2) When sentencing mentally ill offenders, considerations of moral culpability and the protection of society may be competing tensions: [44]-[45]. However, the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the criminality of the offence: [43], [45].
 Considered: Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465






			Judgment 
1BEAZLEY P:  On 5 April 2012, the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence of stealing a knife contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 117 and to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33(1)(a).  The victim of this crime was the applicant's father.  The maximum penalty for the stealing offence is 5 years imprisonment.  The wounding offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
2On 5 June 2012, the Crown applied to the District Court to reject the applicant's pleas of guilty on the basis that a more appropriate outcome of the matter would be a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, s 38.  This application was supported by the expert evidence of Dr Nielssen, a psychiatrist, who had concluded that the applicant would have the defence of mental illness open to him, and that a special verdict would be beneficial to both the accused and the community.  The trial judge, Nicholson DCJ, rejected that application.
3The applicant was sentenced by Nicholson DCJ on 5 October 2012.  His Honour sentenced the applicant in respect of the wounding offence to a term of imprisonment of 8 years commencing on 3 January 2011 and expiring on 2 January 2019.  His Honour set a non-parole period of 4 years such that the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 2 January 2015.  In respect of the stealing offence his Honour entered a conviction but otherwise imposed no penalty pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 10A.
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  If leave is granted, the proposed grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant are as follows: 
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in waiving the applicant's right to rely upon his mental illness as a relevant mitigating factor in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.
Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in finding that ""absent a reliance on mental illness the now unexplained irrationality and malice are matters to be taken into account adverse to the offender"".
Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in that he gave insufficient weight to the applicant's acute psychotic disorder at the time of the offence in assessing the appropriate sentence.
5The essential challenge raised by these three grounds was that the sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the applicant's mental illness.  
Background facts
6The applicant is a 40 year old man who has been diagnosed as suffering from either a major mental illness of schizoaffective disorder or a relapsing psychotic illness with features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  There is a history of mental illness in his family, his mother suffering from schizophrenia which was diagnosed when the applicant was an infant.  The applicant and his older brother were brought up by their father since the applicant was six months old, when their mother separated from the family.  
7The applicant has had mental health problems since about the age of 19.  He has had approximately seven admissions to psychiatric hospitals in Western Australia, including two as an involuntary patient under that State's mental health legislation.  He has been prescribed antipsychotic medication.  Some periods of hospitalisation were for up to three months.  He was at some stage treated with long acting injections as a condition of a Community Treatment Order. 
8On 3 January 2011, the applicant stole a chef's knife from a Big W store.  He then went to his family home where, until shortly prior to Christmas 2010, he had lived with his father.  The applicant and his father had quarrelled about two weeks before Christmas, during which the applicant had said to his father, ""I am going to kill you one day, you son of a bitch"".  
9When he entered the house, the applicant's father was seated on a lounge chair in the living room watching a DVD.  The applicant approached him from behind and placed a hand on his father's forehead and tilted his head backwards.  The applicant then ran the blade of the knife across his father's neck from right to left, causing a wound that commenced in the middle of the throat to a point near the right ear.  It required 15 stitches and was described by the treating doctor as ""serious"".  The wound was deep and cut through the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage.  The right anterior jugular vein was lacerated.  The sternoclamistoid muscle on the right side was also partly severed.  Untreated, the injury was life threatening.  Upon arrival at hospital, the father was immediately rushed to surgery.
10The applicant's father described the offender at the time of committing the offence as having an emotionless and expressionless face, appearing as if he was in a trance.  When the father asked the applicant why he had done that, the applicant responded, ""I had to do that, you are the devil"".  Apparently, the applicant had not been able to sleep for the four nights preceding the commission of the offence.  The applicant was arrested later that day and participated in an ERISP.  
11On the hearing of the application by the Crown to reject the plea of guilty, the trial judge referred to some of the answers the applicant  gave in his ERISP, describing those answers as ""bizarre and unfocused"".  These included references to his being in church;  to a ""devil name"";  to things being done to him in his sleep;  to being ""like pure evil, this thing"";  to there being ""such a sickness in me"";  and that he ""couldn't control"" himself.
12The applicant was referred to Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, for the purposes of obtaining a report for the sentence hearing.  During the consultation with Dr Nielssen, he said that at the time of the offence he was ""in a psychosis"", that ""supernatural things were happening"" and that he had ""some powerful delusions"".  He said that he did not want to kill his father, but that he wounded him ""to get relief from my situation"".
13Dr Nielssen reviewed the applicant's ERISP, which he considered confirmed the presence of symptoms of psychotic illness.  He stated that the applicant's answers ""were disorganised in a way that was consistent with the disorder of form of thought of chronic mental illness"".  Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as suffering from a schizoaffective disorder.  He also remarked that when free of symptoms of psychosis, the applicant had periods of ""both elevated and depressed mood"".  He noted that the symptoms of the applicant's condition were well documented in the medical records from Western Australia and confirmed by a statement of the applicant's father describing the onset and course of his son's mental illness.  Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that at the time of the consultation, the applicant was elevated in mood and was in need of more intensive treatment for his psychiatric condition.
14The medical evidence indicates that the applicant's mental illness is relatively well controlled by medication.  However, his father had described signs of the return of mental illness in December 2010.  Hospital records at that time reported that the return of his symptoms was due to the cessation of his medication.  It was common ground that the applicant had again ceased taking his medication some months prior to the commission of the offences, as he said that he felt better without it. 
15Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that the contemporaneous documents, including witness statements and the applicant's answers in the ERISP, confirmed that the applicant:
""... was acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence and that he committed the offence in response to symptoms of mental illness rather than for any rational or malicious reason."" 
16Dr Nielssen also expressed the view that the defence of mental illness would be available to the applicant.  He observed that the applicant's illness responded to treatment and that the applicant did not have a pattern of antisocial conduct or a drug abuse disorder.  Dr Nielssen stated that in his experience a special verdict (available under the Mental Health Act) was of benefit both to an accused person and to the community because rehabilitation through a separate forensic hospital system was very successful and as the rate of re-offending of patients granted release was very low.  
17Dr Nielssen also recorded that the applicant was reported ""to have limited insight into the nature of his mental illness and limited ability to recognise symptoms of the illness when they emerge"".  He stated that the medical records revealed that the applicant was affected by similar symptoms during acute exacerbations of his illness.  Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that these symptoms might present a danger to himself and others when he was acutely unwell.  The applicant had in fact self-harmed on the occasion of the 2010 admission to hospital, which was involuntary.  On that occasion he had cut both his cubital fossae to ""release evil spirits"".
The trial judge's remarks on sentence
18His Honour considered, at [38], that although the applicant must have stolen the knife from the Big W store ""in contemplation"" of causing some harm, he did not contemplate causing serious harm to his father.  His Honour found, at [39], that when the applicant entered the living room, his father was sitting with his back to him and did not realise that he was in perilous danger.  His Honour found, at [45], that the injury, whilst not rating high on the scale of available grievous bodily harm outcomes, was nonetheless a very nasty injury, with long-term, if not permanent, physical sequelae, as well as having had a serious psychological impact on the father.
19The sentencing judge observed, at [31], that Dr Nielssen had expressed the opinion that the applicant's mental health condition had some causal impact upon the commission of the offence.  His Honour found, at [43], that the attack was motivated by unfounded paranoid thoughts the applicant had in relation to his father, based on an ""unfounded belief that he felt justified in seeking to cause his father really serious injury"".  However, because the applicant had chosen not to avail himself of the mental illness defence, his Honour considered, at [36], that the applicant's mental condition was not to be taken into account when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.  
20In coming to this determination, his Honour noted that the applicant's plea of guilty was not only an admission of the elements of the offence, but was also an acceptance by the applicant that he had no way of avoiding responsibility for his conduct.  As his Honour put it, at [33]: 
""In effect [the applicant] has waived his right to rely upon this mental state as a mitigating circumstance of the objective seriousness of the offence.""  
21His Honour accepted that the full scope of the applicant's mental illness was relevant to the consideration of the subjective circumstances of the applicant, although, he noted that there were competing tensions in that proposition.
22His Honour noted Dr Nielssen's opinion that the applicant had committed the offence ""in response to mental illness rather than for any rational or malicious reason"".  His Honour considered, however, at [48], that the applicant's conduct was in fact ""irrational and malicious"" and in the absence of any reliance upon a defence of mental illness, the unexplained irrationality and malice were matters to be taken into account adversely to the applicant.
23His Honour next referred to the father's victim impact statement, noting the serious psychological impact that the wounding had upon him.
24In dealing with the applicant's subjective circumstances, his Honour referred, at [62]-[63], to Dr Nielssen's diagnosis of a schizoid affective disorder and the symptoms the applicant experienced at various times, including ""supernatural communication"", ""external control of his movements"", ""persecutory delusional beliefs"" and a ""disorganisation of answers"" consistent with disordered thought processes.  
25His Honour also referred, at [68], to the applicant's criminal history, but as it was not extensive, his Honour considered that it would entitle the applicant to leniency in respect of sentencing for this offence.  His Honour was concerned, at [69], that although the applicant had expressed regret to the Probation and Parole Service, his evidence in the sentence hearing suggested that there were still matters of tension between the applicant and his father that may have been the result of, or be exacerbated by, paranoid ideation in respect of his father.  
26His Honour, at [70], allowed a 20 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, rather than a greater discount that might have been allowed on an early plea of guilty, because he was concerned about the quality of the applicant's contrition.  His Honour did not regard the matter as one suitable to take into account either personal or general deterrence.  His Honour stated that, but for the plea of guilty, he would have set an overall sentence of 10 years imprisonment.  Taking into account the discount of 20 per cent, the overall sentence imposed by his Honour was 8 years.  His Honour set a non-parole period of 4 years.
27In approaching the sentencing task, his Honour referred to Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623;  Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465,  Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18;  R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67;  Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120;  and Muldrock v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 108.  I will refer to those decisions more fully below. 
Consideration
28The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge failed to apply the principles relevant to sentencing offenders with a mental illness.  He relied in particular upon the statements in The Queen v Mooney (Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978, unreported) as to the principles to be applied when sentencing offenders whose mental illness at the time of the offending was such as to provide a defence of insanity although the defence was not relied upon.  It is appropriate to set out the passages upon which the applicant relied:
""On a plea of guilty a sentencing juge is precluded from passing sentence on any basis inconsistent with the conclusion that the offender is legally responsible for the crime to which he has pleaded guilty.
How, then, is a trial judge to sentence an offender who adduces evidence in support of a plea in mitigation to the effect that he was mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offence?
In sentencing generally it is necessary to balance personal and general deterrence on the one hand with rehabilitation on the other.  But in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality general deterrence is a factor, which should often be given very little weight ... because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.  The mental condition of an offender may be taken into account when passing sentence, but whether the evidence establishes legal insanity or mental illness stopping short of legal insanity, the question to be answered is whether the interests of society permit or the interests of the offender require that the sentence to be passed be reduced from what would otherwise be appropriate rather than what the offender's responsibility for the offence should be regarded as having been reduced.""  (per Young CJ)
""In the present case, a defence of insanity probably could have been made out on Mooney's behalf.  That defence not having been taken, the Court could not deal with him upon the basis that a disease of the mind had so affected his reason that he did not know that he was doing, or that what he was doing was wrong ... The sentencing court, however, must proceed upon the basis that the offender has accepted legal responsibility for his offence, either by plea or verdict.  His mental condition, and in particular the possibility that his mental condition in the future may be different from that existing at the time of the offence, remain significant in the determination of what is an appropriate course to be adopted in relation to him as an individual and to the protection of the community from him and from those who might be disposed to imitate him.
In my opinion Mooney was, at the time when he was sentenced, an inappropriate person to be made the medium of a deterrent sentence.  Moreover, since public sentiment is of significance in this area of the law, I think that sensible people well informed as to the facts would have held that view.""  (per Lush J)
""... [A]n evaluation of the offender's moral responsibility for his crime is always required in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.""  (per Jenkinson J)
29A similar approach was taken by this Court in Engert, to which the sentencing judge referred.  In Engert, Gleeson CJ stated, at [71], that:
""... the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system.""
30The applicant makes no complaint in respect of his Honour's approach to questions of personal or general deterrence.  Although the remarks in Mooney that a mentally ill offender is not an appropriate medium of a deterrent sentence were not directly applied, the applicant accepted that the primary judge's findings on deterrence operated in his favour.  The applicant contended, however, that his Honour wrongly applied other sentencing principles, including those discussed in Mooney and Engert, in relation to offenders suffering from a mental illness.  In particular, the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in rejecting the applicant's mental illness in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  The applicant contended that although his plea of guilty precluded his mental illness from absolving him of criminal responsibility, it could be used to demonstrate his significantly impaired state of mind at the time of offending which, on his submission, informed both objective criminality and moral culpability.
31The question of what is meant by moral culpability in the sentencing process and whether the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is to be assessed without regard to an offender's mental state at the time of the offending was considered in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The High Court there observed, at [54]:
""The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.""  (citations omitted)
32The Court had earlier stated, at [27]:
""Section 54B(2) and (3) [of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act] oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as 'the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness'. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""  (emphasis added)
33In McLaren v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 284, McCallum J (McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing), in considering this passage, stated:
""27 The appellant contends that his Honour's conclusion may now be seen to have entailed error in that the decision in Muldrock renders impermissible any consideration of the applicant's state of mind in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence at hand.
28 In my view, that submission misconceives the effect of the decision in Muldrock. The phrase 'objective seriousness' in Muldrock at [27] ... refers specifically to the definition in s 54A(2) of the Act as to what a 'standard non-parole period' denotes. That is the ""concept"" referred to in the previous sentence of that paragraph. The point there made by the High Court, as I would understand it, is that there is no sense in attempting to place the offence at hand (with all its features, including matters personal to the offender where relevant to an assessment of the nature of the offending) at a point along a purely hypothetical range which, of its nature, is ignorant of those matters.
29 The decision in Muldrock does not, however, derogate from the requirement on a sentencing judge to form an assessment as to the moral culpability of the offending in question, which remains an important task in the sentencing process. That this assessment is also sometimes referred to as the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence perhaps contributes to the misconception. I do not understand the High Court to have suggested in Muldrock that a sentencing judge cannot have regard to an offender's mental state when undertaking that task (as an aspect of his or her instinctive synthesis of all of the factors relevant to sentencing).""
34Her Honour's analysis is, respectfully, not only correct, but aptly captures the relevance of moral culpability in the sentencing process.
35It follows, in my opinion, that the sentencing judge in this case erred in determining that the applicant had waived his right to have his mental illness considered as a causal factor in the commission of the crime. 
36That is sufficient itself for the grant of leave to appeal.  Whether the appeal should be allowed requires the Court to determine, in accordance with the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6(3), whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.  Before considering that question, reference should be made to grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal.
Ground 2:  the sentencing judge erred in finding that absent a reliance on mental illness the now unexplained irrationality and malice are matters to be taken into account adverse to the applicant
37The sentencing judge described, in appropriate detail, the occasion and circumstances of the offending, noting, at [39], that the ""offence was sudden, unannounced and achieved by stealth"".  His Honour observed that the applicant had ""offered a reason to the father that made no sense"".  His Honour also found that the applicant had formulated the intention to do grievous bodily harm at the time that he pulled out the knife from wherever it was secreted upon his body.  
38His Honour, at [47], referred to Dr Nielssen's medical opinion that the applicant had committed the offence ""in response to mental illness rather than for any rational or malicious reason"".  His Honour found, however, at [48], that ""on any view"" the applicant's conduct ""was irrational and malicious"".  His Honour continued:
""Dr Nielssen's wording of the situation was an unhappy one if he was seeking to excuse it on account of the offender's incapacity to reason with a moderate degree of calmness.  It was this incapacity that saw the offender irrational and malicious.  There is no doubt that the offender was irrational and malicious.  In the case of mental illness that irrationality and malice is something an offender will not be held responsible for, but absent a reliance on mental illness the now unexplained irrationality and malice are matters to be taken into account adverse to the offender.""
39His Honour's last statement was in error.  The error stemmed from his earlier conclusion that the applicant had waived his right to rely upon his mental state in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  As I have explained, the applicant's mental state at the time of offending remained relevant to the sentencing process, including in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant's moral culpability, notwithstanding that the applicant had not proceeded under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.  
40It follows that I would allow ground 2 of the appeal.
Ground 3:  the sentencing judge erred in that he gave insufficient weight to the applicant's acute psychotic disorder at the time of the offence in assessing the appropriate sentence
41This ground can be dealt with briefly.  The applicant directed the Court's attention to the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales relating to sentences imposed for offences under s 33(1)(a).  Those statistics revealed that in the period from February 2008 to June 2013, 85 per cent of persons sentenced for an offence under this provision received a sentence of less than 8 years.  51 per cent of all offenders received a sentence of 5 years or less.  72 per cent of all offenders received a non-parole period of less than 4 years and 64 per cent of offenders received a non-parole period of 3 years or less.  The applicant particularly relied upon the statistic that no offender with a similar profile to him, that is, as having pleaded guilty to one offence only before the Court under s 33(1)(a), had received a sentence greater than 8 years, being the sentence that was imposed upon him.  An examination of the relevant statistics to which the applicant referred reveals that they related to the imposition of the non-parole period.  Full term sentences of 12 years have been imposed for a single offence on a plea of guilty.
42The applicant submitted that the sentencing outcome reveals error in that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to his mental illness, even in the consideration of the applicant's subjective case.  Had he done so, the applicant submitted, both the full term and the non-parole period imposed would have been lower.
43The reasoning of the plurality in Veen (No 2) is of particular relevance to this ground of appeal.  Their Honours observed that the principle of proportionality was an established sentencing principle with the consequence that a sentence could not be increased merely so as to provide for a longer period of protection of society from the risk of re-offending:  see Veen (No 2) at [8].  Nonetheless, the protection of the community remained relevant to the sentencing process.
44The plurality further observed that the sentencing principles that guided courts in imposing sentences could not be considered in isolation from each other and further recognised that the principles sometimes pointed in opposite directions.  Thus, their Honours noted that:  
""...a mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter. These effects may balance out, but consideration of the danger to society cannot lead to the imposition of a more severe penalty than would have been imposed if the offender had not been suffering from a mental abnormality.""
45This passage would appear to be the basis of his Honour's comment that there were competing tensions when considering the applicant's mental illness.  It will be recalled his Honour considered that the applicant was potentially a danger to his father and there was also the history of occasions of non-compliance with his medication regime, which led to periods of hospitalisation and, on this last occasion, to the commission of a serious offence.  It is also apparent that his Honour well understood the principle of proportionality.  Nonetheless, the sentence imposed failed to make appropriate allowance for the applicant's mental condition and his low level of moral culpability, with the consequence that the sentence imposed was not proportionate to the criminality.  This last observation leads to the result that some other sentence is warranted in law:  the Criminal Appeal Act, s 6(3).
46Although the considerations to which I have referred have led me to the view that some other sentence is warranted in law, the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed requires that those considerations be balanced with the evidence as to the nature and seriousness of this offence and the danger which the applicant poses, given the nature of his illness;  the consequences which follow from the applicant ceasing to take the medication which helps control his illness;  the applicant's limited insight into the nature of his illness;  and his limited ability to recognise symptoms of his illness, when they emerge, at which point he presents an acute danger.
47Having regard to all of these matters, I consider that an appropriate sentence is a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months commencing on 3 January 2011 and expiring on 2 July 2014 with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 2 July 2017.
48I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal is granted.
2. The appeal is allowed.
3. The sentence imposed in the District Court on 5 October 2012 is quashed.
4. The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years.  The sentence is to date from 3 January 2011.  The earliest day the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 2 July 2014.  The total term expires on 2 July 2017.

2763732,Griffiths v R [2014] NSWCCA 60,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 30 July 2012 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court in Parramatta on an indictment that contained a single count of reckless wounding (of MZ), brought under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 35(4). After a trial that took place over a number of days, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The applicant now appeals against the conviction. He did, but now does not, seek leave to appeal against the sentence subsequently imposed. The sole ground of appeal asserts that the verdict of guilty was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. Because such a ground involves a question of fact alone (or a question of mixed law and fact) the appellant requires leave to appeal: see Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1)(b). 

2The task of this Court where such a ground is raised is well established and well known: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; MFA v the Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.

3The Court must make its own independent assessment of the sufficiency and quality of the evidence. The question, ultimately, is whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, nevertheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand: M at 492; or whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

4In making that assessment, the court is obliged to give full weight to the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, and has had the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses.

The Crown case

5The Crown case may be stated as follows. Much of it is not in dispute.

6On the evening of 20 August 2011, Ms Amy Key celebrated her 27th birthday by having a party at her home in Lurnea. Among others, she invited the applicant, who was her cousin, and who attended with his girlfriend and with Corey Littlewood and his girlfriend. Corey Littlewood was an unusually and distinctively tall man. Also in attendance at the party were DZ, his son MZ, MZ's friend (CW), and a friend of DZ, Dario de Castro. Mr de Castro shared accommodation with DZ and MZ, and was in a casual romantic relationship with Ms Key. MZ and CW were both 15 years of age. In order to promote compliance with s 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), the names of DZ, MZ and CW have been withheld.

7At an early stage of the party, Ms Key observed signs of hostility from the applicant and Mr Littlewood towards MZ and Mr de Castro. (This, it was said, stemmed from publication on the Internet by Mr de Castro of information about his relationship with Ms Key.) DZ also observed the hostility. He said that the applicant and Mr Littlewood behaved in an intimidating manner, giving him and his son ""death stares"". He felt uncomfortable and decided to take the teenagers home. Eventually, the hostility became a confrontation with Mr Littlewood verbally abusing CW and MZ, and following DZ and MZ outside. He then hit MZ in the face, breaking his nose.

8DZ attempted to defend and protect his son. A physical altercation broke out, in which Mr Littlewood was the aggressor. During the course of the physical altercation, MZ was struck in the back of the head with a wine bottle, which shattered and caused him injury. This was the subject of the charge on the indictment. DZ and Mr de Castro took MZ to the Liverpool Hospital. CW accompanied them. The Crown case was that it was the applicant who struck the blow. 

The trial

9That the melee had occurred and that MZ was struck with a bottle and was injured was not in dispute in the trial. The issue was whether the Crown had established, to the criminal standard, that it was the applicant who struck MZ with the bottle.

10Evidence was given by Ms Key and a number of attendees at the party. Not surprisingly, there was some conflict in the evidence concerning the central event, the striking of MZ with the bottle.

11The first account of that event appears to have been given by DZ to a police officer, Senior Constable Steven Zitianellis at the Liverpool Hospital. Senior Constable Zitianellis was one of several police officers called to Ms Key's address. Later, he attended the Liverpool Hospital and spoke to DZ. He did not have his official notebook with him. There is no record of the time of his conversation with DZ. He made notes of the conversation in what he called his ""scrapbook"". The notes are, relevantly, in the following terms:

""Victim's father - [DZ's name and address]

POI - tall about 6.2

really short light coloured hair

lanky build

 grey long sleeve (shirt jumper) 

- australian Amy's cousin

Victim [MZ's name and date of birth]

POI 2 - Brian

Tall

Version:- Arrived at 6pm 20/8/2011

 Dario - green ford falcon sedan

 Amy's party who are seeing with Dario

 POI's may be cousins of Amy

 Dario posted 'open relationship' 

 Big tall guy picking fight with Dario cause of facebook update

 me, dario, mother, [CW] (15) walked outside front porch

 tall guy pick fight with (15) year old son, 

 tall guy picked up a bottle and smashed it over his head

 POI's friend Brian also had a bottle and swung at victim's father but he ducked and kept fighting with.

 victim's son ended up inside when fight ended.""

It was accepted that ""POI"" was an abbreviation for ""Person of Interest"", and that references to ""the tall guy"" were references to Mr Littlewood.

12By the time he gave evidence in the trial, Senior Constable Zitianellis had no accurate recollection of the conversation with DZ. He said that what was noted was:

""... something just for me to get a quick rundown of what happened to commence the investigation."" 

It is of some interest that Senior Constable Zitianellis said that he made arrangements for DZ to attend the Liverpool Police Station ""at a later date"" in order to provide a statement.

13The account of the altercation given by DZ in the trial was significantly different from what was recorded in Senior Constable Zitianellis' notes. The most apparent construction of what was there recorded was that DZ squarely attributed responsibility for the physical attack (with the bottle) on his son to ""the tall guy"" - that is, Mr Littlewood. 

14In his evidence in the trial, however, he unequivocally and forcefully attributed the striking with the bottle to the applicant. It is necessary to reproduce his evidence at some length. He said:

""Okay the first note was when Corey [Mr Littlewood] started screaming at [MZ], saying 'why are you such a hard cunt, why do you want to be a hard cunt?' And I've turned around and Corey said, 'hey bro I said relax. My son's fifteen.' Corey ignored me and started again on [MZ] and again I said to him, I said, 'yo bro, I said, relax mate he is only 15.' And that was when Corey turned onto me, threatening me saying that he was going to kick my arse all around the car park. I just said, 'don't bother, we're out of here.' And it was at that time when Corey's turned around, screamed at [MZ]'s face, standing over him saying 'why do you have to be a hard cunt' and that was at the time when Corey's actually hit [MZ] and that was when also Brian had come between Corey and the brick wall of the house and hit my son with the bottle. And that was when I, for a moment I was taken back and then I've jumped on the veranda and started getting into Corey and having a fight with that Corey, he was the biggest there. He was the more intimidating. I didn't want him anywhere near my son, I just wanted to get him away from my son. He just wanted to get away from me to attack [MZ]. I kept jumping in front of him and that was when we just had a fist fight and that was it, yes.""

A little later, the following exchange took place:

""Q. And how many blows was it that he received from the accused Brian Griffiths?
A. I've, I've seen Brian hit him with the bottle. I've seen a scuffle, [CW] had jumped up, I didn't see what happened there. My whole concentration was to get this big guy away from my son. My son is fifteen, this guy is in his thirties. I just had to get him away from my son that was all I had to do. That was my whole concentration. I didn't notice what happened on the side. Who was fighting who. My whole concentration was this big guy, that was it. 

Q. Where was the accused standing when he hit [MZ] with the bottle?
A. Standing high on the porch.

Q. On the porch?
A. Yes standing on the porch.

...

Q. You have said though that the accused Brian Griffiths hit your son [MZ] with the bottle?
A. Yes.

Q. You saw that did you?
A. Yes.

Q. And can you describe the bottle?
A. No not at all.

...

Q. And what happened to the bottle upon impact?
A. The bottle just shattered straight away.

Q. At that point why did you go for Corey rather than Brian Griffiths?
A. Corey was the biggest, the tallest, the most intimidating there. My whole reaction was, 'get the biggest guy' I couldn't let him fight my son or even touch my son. After I'd seen the blood Corey wanted to jump on him again. I don't know what Brian was doing. I presumed [CW] jumped in front of [MZ] but I can't be as certain on that because I didn't notice. But that was my whole reaction. I just wanted to get this big guy away from him.""

[The first answer in this extract was initially recorded as ""I didn't see Brian hit him with the bottle."". However, after the sound recording was replayed at a later date, it was established that the words used were those set out above.]

15In cross-examination, the following exchanges took place:

""Q. Did you see no one else get hit with a bottle?
A. The only bottle I saw used was Brian Griffith's hit my son with a bottle and then when I was fighting Corey the last thing I was taking note was who's doing what. I had my own concentration. I had my own fight to deal with, that was it and no I didn't see who was hitting who with bottles or if anything else. I didn't take notice of what was going on around me. I'm focussed on this big tall guy that was it.

...

Q. You were concentrating on taking the big guy out because the big guy hit your son with the bottle?
A. No that's incorrect because I saw Brian - Brian Griffiths hit my son with a bottle, not Corey. Corey hit my son in the face in the nose and broke his nose and then Brian hit him a bottle. That's the way I seen it; don't try and put words into my mouth because I'm a bit offended over that. I know what I seen. It was Brian Griffiths that hit my son not Corey. I took Corey out because he was the biggest and the biggest threat there, so don't try and make it out any other way please.

...

Q. And you later, from later that morning onwards, worked out who you think might be responsible for hitting your son on the head?
A. No not at all, I saw who hit him. Not at all, don't try and put words in my mouth. I didn't assume or hear from anyone. I'm saying what I had seen with my own eyes and I'd seen Brian Griffiths use the bottle on my son. Not Corey. Brian Griffiths.

...

Q. Mr Griffiths did not strike you - sorry, you did not see Mr Griffiths strike your son on the head?
A. Well that's incorrect because I actually did see him strike him.""

16DZ was cross-examined about the notes made at Liverpool Hospital by Senior Constable Zitianellis. He denied having said that it was Mr Littlewood who hit MZ with the bottle. He said:

""No I don't think I've wrote that or have I stated that at any time because the tall guy didn't him, so you're making this up, I'm telling you what I had seen and now you're telling me that I've got written somewhere, not once have I ever written anywhere or told anybody that it was the tall guy that hit my son with a bottle. Not once have I ever said that because I know exactly who hit him because I was right there, I was in a perfect line of view and I'd seen what happened. Now you're trying to state that I'm saying that Corey hit him, the big tall guy, the big tall guy punched my son in the face. 

Q. Now you told the police that that person's friend, Brian, also had a bottle and swung at you but you ducked and kept fighting with him?
A. No, that's crap because not once did I state that someone attacked me with a bottle or that someone came at me with a bottle. Corey had no bottles in his hand, he was totally hands empty, just like I was, no weapons, it was Brian that came between Corey and the brick wall of the house and hit my son with a bottle and that was when I have jumped up and started hitting into Corey and that's the way it happened. Not once did I say that it was Corey who hit my son with a bottle.

...

A. ... I think you're trying to put words into my mouth and trying to twist things around, not once did I state it was the big tall guy that hit my son with a bottle. Not once did I state that, not in any of my evidence, not in any of my statements. If I really believed it was the tall guy that hit my son with a bottle I would have mentioned the big tall guy hit my son with a bottle, but I'd seen what happened and it wasn't the tall guy, it was Brian Griffiths that hit my son with a bottle because I'd seen it."" 

17DZ was cross-examined also about a statement he had made to police on 23 August. In particular, he was cross-examined about variations between the content of the statement, and the evidence he gave in the trial. The statement was not in evidence. It is, however, of some interest that the cross-examination did not suggest that, in that statement, he had adhered to an account that Mr Littlewood was the perpetrator of the offence. There was no cross-examination directed to variations in any account in that statement of what had happened, and DZ's evidence in the trial.

18MZ gave a description of the opening events, involving aggressive behaviour by Mr Littlewood, similar to that given by his father DZ. His evidence was that thereafter:

""[Mr Littlewood] pushed me in the chest with an open palm about like this, like more towards - to my neck and I stumbled backwards, it was quite a hard push and I would describe it more as a hit than a push. And it all happened very quickly, that was about pretty much at the same time when I hit - got hit in the back of the head with the bottle.

...

Q. When you had first gone out the front you said that you saw Brian Griffiths having a cigarette?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you see him again after that?
A. Yes.

Q. Where and when did you see him again after that?
A. He was standing next to the car I picked up a bottle from the recycle bin, after I got hit, and I held it towards him but he kept coming towards me so I hit him with the bottle a couple of times, I don't know how much times but.

Q. Why did you do that?
A. Because I felt threatened.

Q. By who?
A. By Brian Griffiths.

Q. Why did you feel threatened by Brian Griffiths?
A. Because I just got hit in the head with a bottle by him.

Q. How do you know that you just got hit in the head with a bottle by him?
A. Because as soon as I turned around I was --

[This was followed by an objection, resolution of which involved correction to an earlier part of the evidence. It is not necessary to go into the details.]

...

Q. And at the moment that you were hit, were you standing up or what position were you in at the moment--
A. I was standing up.

Q. You were standing up?
A. Yes but when I got pushed, I turned slightly to protect myself.

Q. Sorry?
A. I turned to protect myself because I thought - the taller male went and hit me again so I turned to the left to protect myself and then that was when the bottle came.

Q. So when you turned to the left to protect yourself, which direction were you facing in then?
A. Towards Corey.

Q. Where was he?
A. Right in front of the patio, standing on the patio.

Q. And what direction were you facing in at the moment you got hit?
A. Towards the diagonal type of way.

HIS HONOUR 

Q. And when you say 'the diagonal', do you mean the diagonal to your left?
A. Yes.

CROWN PROSECUTOR

Q. And in what direction were you facing immediately after you got hit?
A. Straight towards Brian Griffin (as said).

Q. Beg your pardon?
A. Straight towards Brian Griffin. As I lifted my head up, I turned towards him.

Q. And when you turned towards him, what did you see?
A. I seen him with broken glass all over the ground and that's what I seen.""

19CW gave evidence. Again, his account of the introductory events was similar to those of DZ and MZ. He then said:

""And I, I seen specifically, I seen the whole thing when Brian ran from out of nowhere and struck [MZ] in the side of the head with the bottle and the bottle just went everywhere. [MZ] dropped to the ground. When I seen this happen I ran at Brian. [MZ] when he got hit he got straight back up and he ran at Brian as well. And then Brian backed up in between the car and a house - and the house, that was about a good - not even a 1 metre gap and he kept going back down there as [MZ] was trying to hit him.""

20Mr Littlewood was made available, at the request of the applicant, for cross-examination. Mr Littlewood was charged with common assault arising out of the incident. He pleaded guilty. He gave no substantive evidence in chief. Cross-examined by trial counsel for the applicant (not counsel who appeared on the appeal), he gave the following account of the events:

""Q. How did you receive that injury to your head, the back of your head?
A. I was hit from behind with a bottle.

Q. Do you remember or did you feel whether or not the bottle smashed or not?
A. From what I can recall I heard a bottle, like I heard the smashing sound.

Q. Did you see anyone else hit with a bottle?
A. Yeah, Brian.

Q. Got hit with a bottle?
A. Yeah.

Q. Did you see who hit him?
A. It all happened so quick but as [DZ]'s pushed past me Brian was hit with a bottle and then I was hit. I've gone to catch Brian as he's fallen back and then I was hit from behind.""

21The Crown was, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), permitted to cross-examine Mr Littlewood. He said that he could not remember very much of that evening, as he was highly intoxicated. He denied that he had struck MZ with a bottle. 

22The applicant did not give evidence in the trial, and did not call any evidence.

The appeal 

23The argument advanced on appeal drew attention to discrepancies in the accounts given by various witnesses. Particular reliance was placed upon the evidence of MZ, extracted above, from which it can be inferred that MZ did not directly see who it was who struck with the bottle. There were, however, strong inferences available from his last answer in the extract of his evidence above. Reliance was also placed upon the differing accounts of CW, and of DZ. 

24Perhaps the most significant aspect of the applicant's case lies in the initial account given by DZ to Senior Constable Zitianellis at the hospital, which, it was accepted, should be interpreted as attributing the striking to Mr Littlewood, not the applicant. 

25There are some difficulties with that. The notes were taken in great haste and very informally. DZ said, understandably enough, that his concentration while at the hospital was with his son and not upon what he was saying to Senior Constable Zitianellis. Of some importance, in my opinion, is that it may be inferred, from the cross-examination on his statement made two days later, that he did not repeat any accusation against Mr Littlewood. Moreover, it is apparent, even from a reading of the transcript, that he was very definite about what he said he had observed. This was a classic case where the opportunity of the jury to observe the witnesses must be accorded full weight.

26Such discrepancies as there were in the accounts were relatively minor, and unsurprising in the circumstances of the events of the evening in question.

27As a matter of reality, only two of those present could be held to have committed the offence - the applicant and Mr Littlewood. Apart from what is recorded in Senior Constable Zitianellis' ""scrapbook"" there is no evidence that the person responsible was Mr Littlewood. There is, by contrast, much evidence of a direct kind that it was the applicant.

28In my opinion it was amply open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck MZ over the head with a bottle. I have made my own assessment of the evidence. On the whole of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who struck MZ with the bottle.

29This is a case in which the evidence strongly implicated the applicant. Only because of the uncertainty created by Senior Constable Zitianellis' notes would I grant leave to appeal.

30I propose that leave to appeal be granted, and the appeal dismissed.

31DAVIES J: I have read and agree with the reasons of Simpson J.

32The basis for the assertion of an unreasonable verdict was the differing accounts given by the witnesses at the trial with some emphasis being placed upon the notes taken by Senior Constable Zitanellis of what DZ apparently said to him at the hospital on the morning after the incident.

33The significant point that Simpson J makes is that MZ could only have been struck with the bottle by one of two people - the Applicant or Mr Littlewood. No person gave evidence at the trial that they saw Mr Littlewood strike MZ with a bottle or that Mr Littlewood had a bottle in his hand at any relevant time.

34Moreover, MZ's evidence (at T 406-407) was that, after he was punched in the face by Mr Littlewood (a matter not really in doubt because Mr Littlewood was separately convicted of that assault), although he turned to the left to protect himself he was still facing Mr Littlewood. It was at that point that he was hit by the bottle. Not only did MZ not say that it was Mr Littlewood that hit him with the bottle but their respective positions and the location of the injury on MZ's head meant that it could not have been Mr Littlewood who struck him in that way without MZ seeing him do so.

35My own assessment of the evidence satisfies me that it was easily open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Applicant who struck MZ with the bottle.

36I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J.

37ADAMSON J: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Simpson J. I agree with the orders proposed and with her Honour's reasons. I have reviewed the whole of the evidence and considered the respects in which there was competing evidence. I agree for the reasons given by Simpson J that it was open on the whole of that evidence for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of reckless wounding, the sole count on the indictment.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763738,Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  The appellant was found guilty by a jury in the District Court of two counts (Counts 1 and 3) on an indictment following a seven day trial.  He was acquitted of a count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1990 (NSW)).  Count 1 was an indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act (in the form it then took), with the circumstance of aggravation being that the victim was 10 years old.  Count 3 was an indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) (in its current form), the victim being 14 years old.  
2The victim and her family were friends of the appellant.  The appellant had migrated to Australia from Sri Lanka when aged around 20, and worked with the victim's father in his lawn-mowing business.  He was a frequent visitor to the victim's family home, and from time to time supported them financially; likewise they had supported him upon his arrival in Australia.  At a celebration of the victim's coming of age, shortly after the conduct giving rise to the first count, the appellant gave the family a gift of $500.  The sentencing judge said that the appellant ""had access to the children's bedrooms during this time and was effectively free to move around the house as he wished.""
3The indecent assault the subject of Count 1 took place in 2008 when the victim was 10 years old.  The indecent assault the subject of Count 3 took place in March or April 2012, when the victim was 14 years old.  The appellant was acquitted of sexual intercourse without consent alleged to have taken place in 2010, when the victim was 11 or 12.  
4The appellant appeals, as of right, from his convictions.  I would, for the reasons which follow, dismiss that appeal.  For that reason, I have referred throughout to the young girl who was the complainant as the victim; she cannot be named or otherwise identified:  Crimes Act 1900, s 578A.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed on 10 December 2013, which was for 12 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 months, commencing 10 December 2013 in relation to Count 3, and 17 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 8 months, commencing 10 January 2014 in relation to Count 1.  The total effect of the sentence was for 18 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 months commencing 10 December 2013 and expiring 9 September 2014.  
5The appellant served just over five weeks of that sentence in custody.  He had been granted bail before and during the trial.  His application for bail immediately after the jury's verdict was refused by the sentencing judge, but a further application was successful, in a reserved decision heard on 16 January and made on 17 January 2014:  R v Peiris (unrep, Fullerton J).  Her Honour was satisfied that there were ""special or exceptional circumstances"" in accordance with s 30AA of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW), and not because of the conviction appeal, but because of the strength of the appeal as to sentence.  Bail was continued after judgment was reserved in this Court. 
6Although there was no express order, it was common ground when the appeal was heard that the intent of the sentencing judge's orders was for the appellant to be released at the conclusion of the non-parole period (cf Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 50(1)).  This Court was invited to make an order to that effect.  In effect, that amounts to the correction of a slip, and does not, of itself, amount to error so as to enliven this Court's discretion to re-sentence.  
Overview of the case at trial
7Because of the nature of the grounds of appeal against conviction, in what follows, I have focussed on the evidence given by the victim.  I have not sought to summarise the whole of the Crown case, or the appellant's case, because it is not necessary to do so in order to resolve the appeal.  
8The victim's evidence in chief was given by playing to the jury a (slightly edited) video recording of an interview with a Detective Senior Constable on 24 April 2012, some weeks after the conduct giving rise to Count 3.  She was thereupon cross-examined (by video link) for much of the second and some of the third day of the trial.
9The victim gave evidence that in 2008, probably the end of 2008, the appellant entered the victim's bedroom and put his hands down her top and squeezed her:  
""Q208:  What did his hands do whilst they were inside your top?
A:  He would have just squishing them.
Q209:  What do you mean squishing them?
A:  Like squeezing
Q210:  Yeah.  What was he squeezing?
A:  My boobs.""
10The victim also said during the interview that a few weeks previously, the appellant had gone into her bedroom and placed his hands into the top of her shirt underneath her bra and squeezed her breasts.  
11In relation to Count 2, for which the appellant was acquitted, the Crown alleged digital penetration occurred in the victim's bedroom while she was exchanging messages with a friend on Facebook.  The victim was lying in bed, with her laptop, under the blankets, and said that he removed her pants:
""[H]e was just talking casually and I was ignoring him because I was talking to her and he just, suddenly just like, I think I was wearing jeans or something and he just unzipped it and he just took it off.""
12The victim said that the appellant then put his hands in her underwear.  After she pushed his hand away, he told her not to tell her parents or friends.  The victim said that it was around this time that she thought she told her friend via a private message on Facebook.  
13Exhibit 8 at the trial was a Facebook message from the victim to her friend dated 19 November 2010:
""btw u noe dat thing bout asela aiya I think we shud all get together and talk bout coz im really getting scarred now!he touches me in inappropriate places and it makes me feel uncomfortable but im scared 2 tell ammi coz i dont wanna ruin there friendship coz asela aiya has helped us heaps [sic]""
14Prior to being interviewed by the Detective Senior Constable, the victim made notes on her iPhone.  The notes were tendered, and included:
""Faking to have period
Bathroom
Offered to take us to the snow
Offered to pay for plane ticket for formal 
Touched my leg in the car
Always offered to pay for stuff
Gave me $500
Touched my boobs
Emma is the police lady""
15The victim agreed that the last line (""Emma is the police lady"") was added to the notes early in the interview.  When cross-examined, counsel for the appellant (who appeared at the trial) had the victim agree that she had recorded what she thought were the important things so that she could remember them, and that there was no mention of any digital penetration.  The victim gave this evidence:
""Q:  You made a list before the interview of the important things that you wanted to talk about in the interview.
A:  Yeah.
Q:  Is the reason why you didn't mention him putting his hand down your pants in your list because it just didn't happen?
A:  No.  That's part of faking to have my period.
Q:  Sorry?
A:  That's part of faking to have my period.  That's the reason why I faked to have my period, so he wouldn't touch my vagina.""  
16She maintained that the appellant had touched her vagina and that it was recorded in her list: 
""It did make the list.  It is implied in 'faking to have a period'.""
17The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined.  He denied the entirety of the victim's evidence.  There were no other witnesses to the alleged incidents, nor any medical evidence, nor any other contemporaneous documentary evidence.  
Appeal against conviction
18This was a case of diametrically opposed testimonial evidence from the victim and the appellant.  The Crown addressed the jury expressly on the basis that they had to accept both the honesty and the reliability of the victim in relation to each of the charges.  The appellant submitted that the victim was making up the entire story.  In his closing address, he went through the note on the victim's iPhone and continued:
""Touched my boobs, that's an allegation but it's in terms of the counts on the indictment, at the lower end of the scale compared to count 2 which is a most serious allegation which doesn't make the list.  Nowhere is insertion of a finger in a vagina mentioned, nowhere is there any reference to an attempt to get hands down pants.  The most serious allegation by a country mile.  
Saying that faking to have a period in beds [sic] that is a reinvention of the wheel.  [The victim] has made a list of things that she needed to remember and you check them, you saw her doing that.  If there is an element of physicality 'touch my boobs' then you'd expect some greater detail in relation to count 2 as to what actually happened.  But really this is a series of self justifications, this is a submission to you I'm making, it's a matter for you entirely. 
...
The fact that those notes were made were needed to be made is something that would cause you to question whether [the victim] is describing real events.  The absence of the level of detail as to what actually occurred is something else that would cause you to question whether she's describing real events and the self justification of her interpretation of the money or the plane ticket or a trip to the snow is something that would cause you to question whether she was describing real events.""
19The two grounds of appeal from conviction were:
Ground 1:  The verdicts are inconsistent; and 
Ground 2:  Having regard to the evidence, the verdicts of guilty are unreasonable and cannot be supported. 
20When the appeal was heard, counsel for the appellant confirmed that Ground 2 was not separate and distinct from Ground 1, but was in truth ""an aspect of [the] primary point that this outcome is inconsistent"" (transcript, 10 March 2014, p 3).  Certainly, it was not put, either in writing or orally, on behalf of the appellant, that this Court needed to conduct its ""own independent assessment of the evidence"" in accordance with Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 463 and 473 and M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492 in order to determine whether the verdicts of guilty on Counts 1 and 3 were open.
21The appellant's submission was straightforward.  He said that the acquittal of the most serious charge suggested a compromise by the jurors:  McKenzie v The Queen (1997) 190 CLR 348 at 366 and 368.  It was submitted that there was no rational way of reconciling the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 3 with the acquittal on Count 2, with the consequence that they should be set aside:  Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439.  Importantly for present purposes, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Jones that the acquittal on one count diminished the complainant's overall credibility, and added (at 453):
""It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts. There is nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.""
22This issue was examined in detail by this Court, constituted by Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Simpson JJ and Carruthers AJ in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82.  This Court rejected the proposition that in a pure word against word case involving a number of charges for sexual offences, a mixture of acquittals and convictions by a jury must inevitably be set aside.  It is clear that all depends on the facts of the particular case (see especially at [65], [73] and [99] (Spigelman CJ, with whom Carruthers AJ agreed), [217]-[219] and [224] (Wood CJ at CL).  The other members of the Court agreed with the analysis of principle by Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL).
23In R v NEK [2001] NSWCCA 392 at [24], Priestley JA, with whom Sully J and Smart AJ agreed, said that:
""Spigelman CJ's principal point in Markuleski was that Jones was not authority requiring courts of criminal appeal to regard mixed verdicts of acquittal and guilty, when all depended upon the evidence of a complainant, as necessarily showing inconsistency by the jury; Jones did not exonerate courts of criminal appeal from deciding upon claims of inconsistency in the light of a consideration of all the circumstances of the case.""
24Sperling J, with whom Sheller JA and Adams J agreed, reviewed the authorities and concluded in R v Bonat [2004] NSWCCA 240 at [106] that:
""There is no hard and fast rule. It all depends on the circumstances of the case.""
and""A primary consideration, in a case of inconsistent verdicts, is whether there is an acceptable explanation for differentiation as a matter of logic and reasonableness."" 
25A consideration of all the circumstances of this case demonstrates that it was open for the jury to find the appellant guilty on Counts 1 and 3, while acquitting him on Count 2.  
26First, the notes on the victim's iPhone, which the victim regarded as important, included references to the conduct comprising Counts 1 and 3, but not that comprising Count 2, save arguably for the ""faking to have my period"" note.  The jury was entitled to have regard to that difference in the corroborative documentary evidence in assessing whether the Crown had discharged its burden in relation to each of the counts on the indictment.  
27Secondly, the victim was cross-examined on the basis that although she had made a note of the appellant touching her breasts, she had made no note of the digital penetration the subject of the second count.  That same distinction between Counts 1 and 3 (which were squarely supported by the iPhone notes), as opposed to Count 2 (which was not), was raised by the appellant's counsel in his address to the jury.  While he did so for the purpose of inviting the jury to disbelieve the victim's evidence in its entirety, it serves to confirm how it was open to the jury not to accept her evidence in so far as it supported Count 2.
28Thirdly, the distinctions referred to above are those discernable merely on the face of the transcript of evidence, and the documentary evidence.  But what appears on the face of the written record of the trial is not the limit of the deference to be given to the jury, which saw the victim and the appellant give evidence and be cross-examined.  For example, the victim's evidence concerning Count 2 involved the appellant suddenly removing her jeans while she was in bed under the blankets.  That conduct is inherently less plausible than the conduct the subject of Counts 1 and 3.  It may well be the case that the demeanour of either the victim or the appellant affected the jury's assessment of the relative cogency of their inconsistent testimony in relation to Counts 1 and 3 as opposed to Count 2.  The decisions collected by Spigelman CJ in Markuleski at [72] reflect an acknowledgment of this limitation upon the appellate court. 
29For all those reasons, it was open - indeed, amply open - for the jury to find that the appellant had touched the victim's breasts in 2008 and 2012 whilst finding that the Crown had not discharged its burden of proving the charge of sexual intercourse without consent in 2010 the subject of Count 2.  Accordingly, I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.  
Leave to appeal against sentence
30In his remarks on sentence, the judge found that the jury's verdict established that the assault constituting Count 1 took place in the victim's previous home in Quakers Hill, probably in her room in 2008, when she was 10 and he around 27 years old.  The incident constituting Count 3 took place around four or five weeks before her interview with the police on 24 April 2012, in her bedroom.  The appellant got the victim out of bed, touched her hands, brought her closer to him and put his hands on her breasts down the top of her T-shirt.  The touching was for some minutes and involved squeezing the breasts inside her bra.  The appellant said words to the effect of ""Don't tell your parents or anyone, because you know I only do this because I love you"".
31I deal with other aspects of the judge's remarks on sentence in connection with the grounds to which they relate.
Proposed Ground One
32This ground is:
""The sentencing Judge erred in not taking into account the applicant's assistance to the authorities.""
33On 10 April 2012, the appellant made a witness statement to the effect that the victim's older brother had been sexually assaulted by the father of one of the victim's friends.  In fact, it was the father of the friend to whom, on 19 November 2010, the victim had communicated by Facebook.  There were two aspects to the statement.  The first was that the appellant had been told by the brother about two years earlier that his sister's friend's father had come into the shower with him some three years earlier (when he was aged about 10); he said that the father's penis was erect.  The second aspect of the statement dealt with events of late January 2012, two and a half months earlier, when the victim's brother told the appellant that he was scared to stay at his sister's friend's house because the father came into his room and touched his penis in the night.  
34The sentencing judge had regard to the fact that the appellant made that statement.  His Honour expressly relied upon the appellant's preparedness to give evidence in those other proceedings to apply (to use his Honour's words) ""a substantially greater discount than would normally be available"" by way of adjustment to the statutory ratio between the parole and non-parole periods.  His Honour applied a ratio of 50%.  
35However, his Honour did not apply s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to discount the sentence for assistance to the police.  There was no statement from the police assessing the statement's utilitarian value to the pending proceedings.  Indeed, although a police officer familiar with the other investigation was asked about the statement during the course of the trial, she was not asked to express an opinion as to its utility. 
36His Honour said that:
""It does not seem to me, particularly absent any evaluation from the police, that it requires [or] justifies a specific discount.  However, I do propose to take the assistance and the statement into account in a general way and specifically in terms of the offender's preparedness to be cooperative with the authorities in terms of his prospects for rehabilitation.""
37The appellant contended that the failure to obtain a specific discount, in accordance with s 23(1), disclosed appellable error.  He pointed out, correctly, that the language of s 23(1) was broadly worded, and extended where assistance was provided in proceedings relating to ""any other offence"".  The Crown contended that this was not a case where the appellant was criminally involved in a matter as an informer witness, seeking a ""Cartwright"" discount (cf R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243), instead, he was merely undertaking his public duty by providing a ""complaint"" statement in an upcoming trial, and not entitled to a discount. 
38It is not necessary to determine in this appeal whether the prima facie broadly worded language of s 23(1) applies to the statement provided by the appellant, although I am doubtful that s 23(1) can bear its ordinary literal meaning.  It seems unlikely that on the true construction of s 23, a victim of a home burglary who reports the crime to the police years before himself offending can ask for that assistance to be taken into account under the section (that is the example given by RA Hulme J in RJT v R [2012] NSWCCA 280; 218 A Crim R 490 at [40]). The use sought to be made of s 23(1) by the appellant here is not nearly so extreme, yet the example indicates the difficulties which will, in an appropriate case, need to be confronted arising out of its broadly worded text.  Those difficulties are also acknowledged by Basten JA (with whom Adams J agreed) in RJT at [6].  
39However, because it is not necessary to resolve those difficulties, it is inappropriate to do so.  This ground can and therefore should be decided by upholding the reasoning of the sentencing judge that no sound basis had been established to warrant applying a discount.
40There was no evidence at all before the sentencing judge (or for that matter this Court) as to the value of the appellant's statement.  It is easy to see that a statement by a man whose testimony had been rejected by a jury in a sexual assault case, directed to incriminating the father of the girl to whom the victim of his own assaults had sent a Facebook message tendered in his own trial, would be the subject of substantial attack were it relied upon by the Crown.  It is certainly possible that the evidence was worthless.  It is certainly possible that it is of slight assistance.  It is also possible that it is of significant weight.  To the extent that it bears any significant value, that will very much depend upon the testimonial and forensic evidence otherwise available to the Crown.  
41Section 23(2) required the sentencing judge to consider the significance and usefulness of the statement and its truthfulness, completeness and reliability; however there was no way in which that task could meaningfully occur.  Moreover, it is essential if s 23 applies for the sentencing judge to state with precision the discount applied (not least, so that if the future assistance is not forthcoming, the discount can be reversed:  see R v GD [2013] NSWCCA 212).  There was, on the material made available to the sentencing judge, no rational way in which that could be done by reference to assistance whose value was an entirely unknown quantity.  
42To be clear, in the previous two paragraphs, I am not determining the value of the statement - as to that, this Court is as poorly placed as the sentencing judge.  I am merely explaining why there was no error disclosed by the sentencing judge's conclusion that no basis for a discount under s 23 had been established.  
43For completeness, I add that when the appeal was heard the Court was told that a further statement had been provided by the appellant in 2014.  There was no evidence of this, or its value, nor was an application made to adduce fresh evidence.  However, even if that had taken place, for the reasons given above the outcome would have been the same in the absence of any means of assessing its value.
44No error is disclosed in the approach adopted by the sentencing judge.  I would not grant leave to agitate this ground.  
Proposed Ground Two 
45Ground 2 is that:
""The sentencing Judge erred in taking into account a breach of trust as an aggravating factor for both offences.""
46The language of Ground 2 reflects that used in the sentencing remarks.  Early in those remarks, the sentencing judge said that the victim's family, and particularly the victim's parents, clearly trusted the offender implicitly.  Under the heading ""Consideration"", his Honour said:
""Here, and in particular in relation to my consideration, I do not accept the submission that there was no breach of trust by the offender.  That was essentially submitted on the basis that there was no handing over of responsibility by the parents of the victim to the offender.  In my view, that is not a proper finding given the evidence of the victim's parents ... which I have separately reviewed, and the circumstances of their ongoing relationship, whereby the offender was effectively given the free run of the house.
Even though there may be some ambiguity about whether the parents or either of them were home on either of the two occasions the subject of these counts, the fact is that the offender was, by virtue of his relationship, able to maintain his ongoing contact with the victim, which included either passing on messages from the parents from time-to-time, or being in the children's physical proximity and in their areas of the house, if not their bedrooms.  As I have said, the freedom that he had included access to the victim's bedroom and to have ongoing discussions with her in a variety of situations.""
47His Honour added that he accepted the victim's evidence that the appellant told her not to tell her parents what was going on.
48Under the heading ""Breach of Trust"", his Honour said:
""Here, I need to look very closely at this aspect of the breach of trust.  A breach of trust is not limited to a parental or spousal relationship - see R v MAK [2005] NSWCCA 369.  Here the breach of trust, in my view, was primarily to the victim, but also to her parents.  That position of trust was built up over a long period of time and included, for example, him going to the various homes of the victim's family.  It is, in my view, that aspect which mandates a period of imprisonment from the point of view of both general and specific deterrence.""
49It is clear from the closing words of that passage that the finding of ""breach of trust"" was significant in, if indeed not determinative of, his Honour's discretion to impose a custodial sentence.
50Taking a strict view, it might be argued that there is a difficulty here.  The sentencing remarks reflect a departure from the language of the statute, seen in the recurring (albeit not invariable) use of ""breach of trust"".  That reflected the submissions made to the sentencing judge, by the Crown and appellant, which employed that language interchangeably with that of the statute.  That approach can lead to error.
51The aggravating factor which is required by s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be taken into account is:
""the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim"".  
52It is well established that a breach of trust is not sufficient to make out this aggravating factor.  In Karl Suleman v R [2009] NSWCCA 70 at [22], Howie J, with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J, said of s 21A(2)(k) that:
""This aggravating factor is not made out simply because the victim trusted the offender for some reason or other ... The relevant factor is that there was at the time of the offending a particular relationship between the offender and the victim that amounted to 'a position of trust'.  It is a special relationship existing between them and transcends the usual duty of care arising between persons in the community in their everyday contact or their business and social dealings.""
53Earlier, it had been said in MAH v R; R v MAH [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [69] by Grove J, with the agreement of Hidden and Kirby JJ, in connection with a group of teenage friends two of whom were found by a jury to have killed a third because of jealousy: 
""A 'position of trust' does not equate with the mutuality of trust which exists between social associates such as within the close knit group disclosed in the evidence.""
54Consistently with this, RS Hulme J, with whom Giles JA and Adams J agreed, dealt with nine convictions for indecent assault and sexual intercourse without consent of a child, in Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 163.  The offender was a friend of the victim's father, and from time to time father and victim stayed in the offender's house.  His Honour said at [39]:
""One factor that affected a number, if not all of the offences was that his Honour regarded the Applicant as having been in a position of trust.  As is apparent from what I have said, I do not dissent from this view in the case of offences 7 to 9.  However, as it would seem that the complainant's father was in the room, albeit asleep, when the other offences occurred, and there was no evidence to suggest that the Applicant had been given or undertaken any responsibility for the complainant, I see no basis for describing him as in a position of trust as that term is used in this area of the law.  Certainly, his position in the case of offences 1 to 6 was not comparable with that of a teacher, babysitter or step-father.  It is to be inferred that this error by his Honour influenced his assessment of the seriousness of each of offences 1 to 6.""
55The appellant relied on the distinction explicit in that reasoning and submitted that there was error in the sentencing remarks, in that it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that both offences were committed in circumstances where there was a ""position of trust"".
56The primary submission during the sentencing hearing was that ""because there had been no handing over of responsibility ... there was no breach of trust"".  That submission was rejected, and in my view properly so.  A position of trust may be abused even if there is no handing over of responsibility.  However, the submission may well distract from the question posed by the statute, which is framed in different terms from that applied by the sentencing judge.
57Although it is desirable not to depart from the terms of the statute, I incline to the view that nothing of substance turns on this ground, for two reasons.  First, it is clear law that remarks on sentence ought not to be subjected to minute scrutiny in search of any indication of error:  see for example Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 129 at [24].  Secondly, it is plain that the appellant had known the victim all of her life, was a close friend of the family and had built up that relationship over a long period of time.  There were occasions when she and her siblings were placed in his care (for example, he was asked from time to time to baby-sit the children).  At least on those occasions, the appellant occupied a position of trust and responsibility.  However, it was not established (and certainly, not established beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270) that the offences occurred on such occasions.
58In short, the fact that the appellant was a trusted family friend who enjoyed access to the house, including the children's bedrooms, was highly relevant to the sentencing process.  Even though it may be doubted, consistently with Smith, whether the appellant thereby occupied a ""position of trust or responsibility"" for the purposes of s 21A(2)(k), the fact that the appellant was trusted by the victim and her family was a central aspect to the assessment of the objective criminality of the offence.  On a fair reading of his sentencing remarks, it was regarded as such by the judge.  Let it be assumed that s 21A(2)(k) did not apply.  It was still necessary, by reason of s 21A(1)(c), for the Court to have regard to ""any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence"".  If there was error, I am inclined to doubt that it made any material difference to the sentencing exercise.
59The approach to s 21A that I favour recognises the difficulties in applying the section, the deference that is properly to be given to sentencing remarks, often given ex tempore, and the need to avoid minute scrutiny for technical error.  However, I acknowledge that the approach I favour may be seen to be more generous than some other decisions of this Court, including Smith.  However, these points were not fully argued, and since it is not necessary in light of my conclusions in relation to proposed Ground 4 to reach a final view on this ground, I refrain from doing so.  
Proposed Ground Three
60This proposed ground is:
""The sentencing Judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences"".
61When addressing objective criminality, the sentencing judge said:
""On the basis of the jury's verdict - as well as the acquittal on count 2 - I find that there was a brief contact on each occasion with the victim's breasts and no genital contact.  It was invasive, but it was relatively transitory.  What is important in that regard is the age difference between the offender and the victim, their differences in physical size and presence and the circumstances of what I regard as a breach of trust.  That supports my finding that there was a relatively low level of criminality - in accordance with the decision of Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 163 - although not at the absolute lowest level, as appears to be urged by the offender's counsel.
Having regard to the circumstances of the offences, in particular the degree of touching involved, the time period involved, the age difference and the impact on the victim, the objective criminality is below mid range but above low range.  What takes it above low range is the length of time involved between the two offences and the breach of trust, particularly given that the events occurred in the victim's home and in her bedroom.
The offender was essentially taking advantage of a young girl and her family in her family home, and indeed in her bedroom on one occasion at least.  The offences occurred on separate occasions, separated by some years.  However, and I must specify this, the fact that there were two offences of the same nature essentially prevents a finding that they were isolated or one-off, random or opportunistic events.""
62The appellant's submissions were focussed on the fact that, in addition to the ""breach of trust"", the matter which took the offences ""above low range"" was ""the length of time between the two offences"".  
63A deal of ""context evidence"" was admitted at the trial.  The victim gave evidence that the appellant was constantly touching her in sexual ways.  He was not charged with this.  His Honour stated specifically that:
""I do not take into account any matters which are not connected to the two offences, nor where there is any connection with the more generalised comments in the statement which appeared to relate to at least some of the matters led by way of context evidence.""
64It was entirely orthodox for the sentencing judge to admit context evidence to displace a submission that the offences were single, isolated events:  R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim 466.  That is what his Honour expressly said that he was doing in the concluding sentence of his remarks on objective criminality reproduced above.  There was no suggestion that Counts 1 and 3 were representative, and there is no need to address the difficulties that arise in connection with such charges:  see Giles v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 308; 198 A Crim R 395. 
65However, where the counts on which the jury convicted the appellant were brief contact with the victim's breasts separated by a period of four years, what is to be made of the proposition that it was the length of time involved between the two offences which (in addition to the breach of trust) took the conduct above the low range?  The appellant submitted that the assessment of objective criminality was coloured by an unarticulated finding that similar conduct was recurring throughout those four years.  If so, then that would be quite wrong, for Counts 1 and 3 were not representative:  see for example DRS v The Queen [2012] VSCA 276 at [19]-[20].  
66However, that was expressly denied by the sentencing judge elsewhere in his remarks, and I would not readily conclude that that was what occurred.  If confirmation be necessary, it is confirmed by the exchanges that took place during the course of submissions.  Although on the first day of the sentencing hearing, the Crown made a written submission that regard could be had to the material consideration that ""the facts reveal behaviour which was part of a wider pattern of conduct"", the sentencing judge made it clear in argument on the second day that he was not adopting that approach:
""Mr Crown it seems to me that the only relevance of that context evidence is to mean that the offender cannot plead that these were ... isolated offence[s].""
67Regard may on occasion be had to exchanges in the course of submissions where they can assist in elucidating abbreviated statements in the remarks on sentence:  Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48; 185 A Crim R 155 at [33].  In the present case, that exchange confirms to my mind that any ambiguity in his Honour's reference to the length of time between offences was not indicative of an improper conclusion of greater criminality.  Other possibilities are available (such as that the offending conduct did not take place over a short, opportunistic period).  Although there is no articulation as to the reasoning process whereby the four year gap led to a conclusion of greater objective criminality, in light of the express statements by the sentencing judge, I do not consider that error has been demonstrated.  I would not grant leave to raise this ground. 
Proposed Ground Four
68Ground 4 is that the sentence is manifestly excessive, although, as will be seen below, included within that ground is a much narrower complaint based on his Honour's reliance on sentencing statistics from the Local Court.  
69On the broad formulation that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, as noted above, his Honour expressed the view, in consecutive sentences, that there was a ""relatively low level of criminality"" and that ""the objective criminality is below mid range but above low range"".  The starting point is to assess the salient facts against the maximum applicable sentence and the standard non-parole period:  Wong v R [2010] NSWCCA 160 at [14].  Given the maximum penalty of 10 years with a standard non-parole period of 8 years, the difficulties faced by the appellant on this ground are obvious.  They are also well recognised.  Indeed, the sentencing judge referred to RS Hulme J's description of ""the absurd relativity"" between the maximum and the standard non-parole period in BT v R [2010] NSWCCA 267.
70On the narrower complaint, the sentencing judge said, twice (Remarks on Sentence, pp 8 and 19), that he had considered the sentencing statistics for such offences in the Local Court as well as the District Court.  His Honour said that he had been assisted by submissions, both oral and in writing from counsel, and that he had examined the Public Defender's website.  His Honour said that the sentences he imposed were within the range of comparable sentences for the relevant time period for the same offences.  However, his Honour otherwise did not in his sentencing remarks disclose the statistics to which he had regard.  He said:
""I do not propose to list all those comparable cases.  To the extent that they are comparable, they [are] demonstrated in the transcript.  I have also considered, as I have said, the JIRS statistics for District Court and Local Court sentences for these offences and consider the sentences I am proposing are appropriate exercises of my discretion.""
71It is appropriate therefore to examine the sentences in fact imposed for aggravated indecent assaults, which is what the sentencing judge expressly said he had done.  For all their limitations, sentencing statistics can and should provide guidance as a useful yardstick:  Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]; Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 88 ALJR 372 at [41].
(a) Sentencing information provided to the judge by the parties
72The record available to this Court reveals the following.  First, the written submissions of the appellant at trial provided five examples of suspended sentences (Exhibit S1, paragraphs 15 and 16).  Secondly, the written submissions of the Crown gave no examples (Exhibit S2).  However, the Crown tendered seven pages extracted from the JIRS database (Exhibit S12, although described as S14 in the transcript).  There were two pages of s 61M(1) penalties for higher courts from April 2006 until March 2013, and five pages of s 61M(2) penalties for higher courts from January 2009 until March 2013.  
73The Crown's oral submissions did not descend to the level of comparable sentences at all (this is not intended as a criticism).  The Crown confirmed that a suspended sentence was within range:  ""So at the end of the day, although it is a matter within range, it is a matter for your Honour.  I'm sorry I can't be any more helpful than that"".  Counsel for the appellant addressed, very briefly, on some of the comparable decisions. 
74The Public Defender's website does not purport to provide a comprehensive summary of decisions.  In respect of s 61M(1) and (2) it is confined to decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and it is far from exhaustive.  It is not of present assistance.   
(b) The JIRS database
75Accordingly, I turn to the JIRS database.  In 2009, s 61M(2) was amended.  Formerly, an element of the offence created by the subsection was that the victim was less than 10 years; it now provides that the victim is less than 16 years.  In relation to Count 3, it is plainly necessary to confine attention to the period from 2009. 
76When accessed in March 2014, the JIRS sentencing database records 169 sentences imposed by the Local Court from October 2009 until September 2013 for aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2).  Of those, 72 (or 43%) resulted in a prison sentence.  However, a majority of 97 out of 169 (or some 57%) resulted in a suspended sentence (44), a bond (48), a community service order (3) or a fine (2).  Overall, 4 out of every 7 sentences imposed by the Local Court were non-custodial.
77If attention is confined to the 53 sentences imposed by the Local Court where there was a plea of not guilty or no plea, the pattern is the same:  22 (42%) resulted in a prison sentence, and 31 (58%) resulted in a suspended sentence (14), a bond (16) or a fine (1).
78In the District and Supreme Courts, the JIRS sentencing database records 57 cases for aggravated assault contrary to s 61M(2), of which 40 (70%) were a prison sentence, and 17 (30%) a suspended sentence or a bond.
79In relation to Count 1, there is a difficulty.  Had the amendment to s 61M taken place six months earlier, it may be inferred that the appellant would have been charged under s 61M(2).  It was not possible to do so, because in 2008 s 61M(2) applied only where the victim was less than 10 years old.  One approach would be to apply older sentencing statistics for s 61M(1), but these are not readily available on JIRS.  Another approach would be to have regard to the sentences imposed under s 61M(2) after 2009 as a proxy for the s 61M(1) conviction, being conscious (as was the sentencing judge) that the offence upon the victim when aged 10 is more serious than when she was aged 14.  A third would be to consider the sentences imposed under s 61M(1), being conscious that the aggregated data does not disclose whether the offence was committed before or after 2009.  
80As it turns out, the sentencing data means that the complexities do not arise, because the s 61M(1) data is substantially the same.  The JIRS sentencing database records 108 sentences imposed by the Local Court from October 2009 until September 2013 for aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1).  Of those, 39 (or 36%) resulted in a prison sentence.  However, a majority of 69 out of 108 (or some 64%) resulted in a suspended sentence (37), a bond (31), or a bond (1).
81If attention is confined to the 35 sentences imposed by the Local Court where there was a plea of not guilty or no plea, the pattern is once again the same:  13 (37%) resulted in a prison sentence, and 22 (63%) resulted in a suspended sentence (12), a bond (9) or a bond (1).  
82It is not possible to determine what Local Court statistics his Honour was relying on.  It is not clear whether statistics up to September 2013 would have been available to him in December 2013.  However, there is no reason to think that if they were only available until March 2013, there would be any significantly different pattern.
83During the sentencing hearing, the Crown fairly acknowledged that a suspended sentence was available.  The sentencing judge found that there was a ""relatively low level of criminality"" and that ""the objective criminality is below mid range but above low range"".  The charged conduct occurred on two occasions, separated by four years, when the offender touched the victim's breasts, briefly, while she was clothed, without any threatened or actual violence.  It was very wrong of him to do this to a child, but given the range of conduct to which s 61M(1) and (2) apply, it was certainly below mid range.
84It was common ground that the proceedings for Counts 1 and 3 could have been disposed of in the Local Court, and his Honour said that he took that into account, as he was required to do:  R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349 at [15] and Bonwick v R [2010] NSWCCA 177 at [43]-[45], even though so far as the appellate record in this Court discloses, the Crown did not supply those Local Court statistics.
(c) The parties' supplementary submissions after the hearing
85After judgment was reserved, the Local Court statistics were provided to the parties, who were invited (on 25 March 2014) to file further submissions.  Both parties did so (on 30 and 31 March 2014).  The Crown noted, correctly, that ""the largest single disposition of matters was dealt with by way of full-time custody, even though that category is between 37 and 43%"".  The Crown added that the statistics revealed little about the matters they dealt with, and ""therefore can only be of limited utility to this court"".
86The appellant submitted that the JIRS statistics suggested that sentences other than full-time custody had been imposed in more than 50% of the cases in the past, and that because the objective seriousness of this case was towards the lower end of the range, they suggested that a custodial sentence was not within the boundaries of a correct exercise of the sentencing discretion.  He said:
""When one takes into account (i) the potential wide range of circumstances covered by the offence, (ii) the low level objective seriousness of these offences, (iii) the Local Court JIRS statistics showing that more than half of cases result in no actual imprisonment for the full range of offending conduct, it is submitted that the 'statistics' do not support his Honour's ... comment regarding the exercise of the sentence discretion.  Quite the opposite, it is submitted the statistics support the applicant's argument that the sentencing discretion has miscarried.""
(d) Consideration
87It is settled law that a ""substantial discretion"" is left to sentencing judges, that there is no single correct sentence, that this Court's own opinion may not be substituted for that of the sentencing judge merely because it would have exercised its discretion differently, and, above all, that the appellant must demonstrate that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"":  the authorities are collected in Vuni v R [2006] NSWCCA 171 at [33] and Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 at [151]-[153] and [197].
88I would reject the broad ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  The appellant has failed to discharge the heavy burden this ground entails.  
89However, that does not resolve the narrow aspect of this ground, based on the repeated reliance by his Honour on sentencing statistics including from the Local Court.  Those aspects of his Honour's remarks disclose material error.  As counsel for the appellant submitted, the findings of the sentencing judge about level of criminality are impossible to reconcile with the sentences imposed by the Local Court, despite the statements of the judge to the contrary.  This is so for two reasons. 
90First, even if the sentences imposed by all courts since 2009 for s 61M(2) convictions are aggregated, half of the sentences are non-custodial.  If comparison is to be made for the legitimate purpose of establishing a yardstick, then it should be made with all the data, which is what the sentencing judge said he was doing, although it seems that only sentencing data for higher courts, and not the Local Court, was tendered at the hearing.  The custodial sentence imposed cannot readily be reconciled with the ""yardstick"" to be discerned from the sentencing data, given that objective seriousness was found to be below mid range.  That proposition can safely be advanced without any knowledge of the particular facts of any of the individual sentences collected in the statistics, because it is a proposition about the data as a whole and there are a large number of sentences imposed disclosing a similar pattern.  Yet the judge gave no other explanation of how he came to the view that the sentence he imposed was ""within the range of comparable sentences"" for the same offences.  
91Secondly, and more compellingly for present purposes, is the fact that the judge expressly said that his sentence was appropriate having regard to the sentencing statistics in the Local Court:
""I have considered the sentencing statistics for such offences in the Local Court.  Although it is difficult to extract precise or analogous details from the statistics and to compare them with the like matters in the District Court, the sentences I am considering are within the range of comparable sentences for the relevant time periods, for the same offences.""
92The remarks on sentence do not disclose what emerged from the Local Court statistics to which his Honour referred.  Nor is it clear precisely what difficulties were encountered by his Honour extracting ""precise or analogous details from the statistics"".  However, what is clear is that the sentence in fact imposed requires explanation to reconcile it with the sentencing statistics from the Local Court. 
93I reject the Crown's submission that the reconciliation is that the largest single category of sentence imposed by courts is a custodial sentence.  That is a correct description of the data, but one that is presently unhelpful.  It reflects the happenstance that the large subclass of non-custodial sentences as presented by JIRS is itself subdivided into suspended sentences, bonds and fines.  
94The fact that the most frequently occurring subclass of sentence is a custodial sentence, according to the classification of sentences employed by JIRS, is irrelevant.  The question of relevance is much simpler:  are most offenders, or for that matter most offenders who plead guilty, who are sentenced in the Local Court, sent to prison?  The answer is very clear:  in the Local Court, majorities of offenders ranging between 57% and 64% are not sent to prison, while minorities between 36% and 43% are.  That is a much greater disparity than the 45:55 split regarded as significant (albeit in a very different context) in Baumgartner v Baumgartner (1987) 164 CLR 137 at 150.  Irrespective of whether an offender is found guilty of the offence in s 61M(1) or s 61M(2), and irrespective of whether the offender has pleaded guilty, only a minority of offenders receive prison sentences from the Local Court, and significant majorities of around half as many again do not.  That is the fact emerging from the sentencing statistics which clashes with his Honour's remarks on sentence.
95The sentencing judge followed the approach of this Court in R v Egan [2013] NSWCCA 196 at [79].  Having determined, with respect correctly, that no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate, and the length of the sentence, the third question is ""whether the sentence can, and should, be suspended"".  The sentence being less than two years, it could be suspended.  If the sentence was, as his Honour said it was, consistent with the sentencing statistics, then either it should have been suspended, or his Honour needed to explain why conduct which was of a relatively low degree of criminality was being punished as if it were of a relatively high degree of criminality.  Error is disclosed by his not doing so.  
96The reasoning I have employed in reaching that conclusion is analogous to that adopted by this Court in Mitchell v R [2013] NSWCCA 318 at [27]-[31] (RA Hulme J, Ward JA and Harrison J agreeing).  I acknowledge that if the position were less clear-cut, it would not be available:  cf the rejection in LB v R [2011] NSWCCA 220 at [29]-[32].  Caution must be employed in the use of statistics, as the High Court has repeatedly insisted.  
97But in this particular case, there is ample data:  cf Hili at [48], and the sentencing judge's express but otherwise undeveloped reliance on the sentencing statistics discloses material error of fact.  I propose that there be a grant of leave in relation to this ground, as well as Ground 2, and the appeal against sentence allowed.  
98It will be evident from the foregoing that I am of the view that some other sentence than that imposed by Knox DCJ is warranted:  Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3), so as to enliven this Court's power to resentence.
Resentencing
99It falls to re-sentence the appellant.  The appellant has served some five weeks in prison.  He will also have two convictions for indecent assault on his record.  He is a young man of otherwise good character, with no prior convictions, with employment and otherwise good prospects.  The sentencing judge found that he was unlikely ever to come into contact with the victim again, and found special circumstances which were, in his words, ""substantially greater than would normally be available"".  Since mid-January, he has been on bail - a period of some two and a half months which, pursuant to s 18(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act does not count as any part of any term of imprisonment.  That said, it is not inappropriate in the circumstances of this case to observe that a term of the bail required the applicant to have been of good behaviour, as well as reporting to Parramatta Police Station each Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
100Like the sentencing judge, I am of the view that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.  The crimes are serious, as reflected in the maximum imposed by the Legislature.  Having regard to the fact that the appellant served just over five weeks of the first sentence imposed by the judge, and one week of the second, and has been subject to the reporting and good behaviour terms of his bail since 17 January 2014, slightly shorter sentences are appropriate than were originally imposed.  Those sentences are capable of being suspended and, for the reasons set out above, should be suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Because they are suspended, I proceed on the basis that commencement dates should not be specified:  R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 199 A Crim R 486 at [218].  
101The practical effect is that the appellant will be at risk of imprisonment, if he should re-offend, for a period which is slightly longer than the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. 
102Accordingly the orders I propose are:
(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed.
(2)Grant leave to appeal against sentence, and allow the appeal.
(3)Quash the sentences imposed on the appellant by Knox DCJ on 10 December 2013.
(4)Sentence the appellant on Count 3 to imprisonment for a term of 8 months.
(5)Suspend execution of the sentence referred to in order (4) for 8 months.
(6)Direct that the appellant be released from custody in respect of that sentence on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 8 months.
(7)Sentence the appellant on Count 1 to imprisonment for a term of 14 months.
(8)Suspend execution of the sentence referred to in order (7) for 14 months.
(9)Direct that the appellant be released from custody in respect of that sentence on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for 14 months.  
103BUTTON J:  I agree with Leeming JA.
104RS HULME AJ:  I agree with the orders proposed by Leeming JA and, subject to the following remarks, with his Honour's reasons.  
105Knox DCJ's reference to a position of trust and his Honour's frequent references to breaches of trust lead me to think that his Honour tended to treat those breaches as an abuse of a position of trust, a factor which s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists as an aggravating factor.  That the two circumstances are not identical is made clear in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [69] and Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 163. 
106Even if this is to misunderstand his Honour's approach, my impression from his Honour's remarks is that he gave the fact of a breach of trust - and the appellant's conduct undoubtedly answered this description - more weight than it merited. Thus after referring in the two immediate preceding sentences to ""breach of trust"" and ""position of trust,"" his Honour observed, ""it is, in my view, that aspect which mandates a period of imprisonment from the point of view of both general and specific deterrence."" 
107A little later his Honour observed:
""What takes (the objective criminality) above low range is the length of time involved between the two offences and the breach of trust, particularly given that the events occurred in the victim's home and in her bedroom.""  
108I am unable to accept that the length of time involved between the two offences - some two years - operated so as to increase the appellant's criminality beyond the mere commission of two offences and contribute to his offending moving above the low range.  In my view the learned sentencing judge erred in so treating the time interval.  
109Thus in my view there was error, additional to that referred to by Leeming JA in the sentencing of the applicant.

THE SENTENCES IMPOSED
The applicant Manly
6The following sentences were imposed upon Manly: 





Offence 

Sentence


Counts 1 and 2

On each count, a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 11 April 2012 to 10 October 2013.


Count 3

A fixed term of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 11 April 2012 and expiring on 10 April 2016.


Count 6

A non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 11 April 2013 and expiring on 10 April 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years imprisonment expiring on 10 April 2018.


Count 9 

A non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 11 April 2013 and expiring on 10 April 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year imprisonment expiring on 10 April 2017.

7The total effective sentence imposed upon Manly was a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 11 April 2012 and expiring on 10 April 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 10 April 2018. 

8It should be noted that the sentence imposed upon Manly by her Honour in respect of count 9 appears to have been an error. A non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 11 April 2013 would necessarily conclude on 10 April 2016, and not 10 April 2015. 

The applicant Hussein
9The following sentences were imposed upon Hussein: 





Offence 

Sentence


Counts 1 and 2

On each count, a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2012 and expiring on 10 April 2014


Count 3

A non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2012 and expiring on 10 October 2019 with a balance of term of 1 year imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2019 and expiring on 10 October 2020.


Count 4

A fixed term of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2012 and expiring on 10 October 2013.


Count 6

A non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2014 and expiring on 10 October 2019, with a balance of term of 4 years imprisonment, commencing on 11 October 2019 and expiring on 10 October 2023.


Count 7 

A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2013 and expiring on 10 October 2019.


Count 8 

A fixed term of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2013 and expiring on 10 October 2017.


Count 9

A fixed term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2011 to 10 October 2014.

10The total effective sentence imposed upon Hussein was a non-parole period of 8 years imprisonment commencing on 11 October 2011 and expiring on 10 October 2019, with a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 10 October 2023.

11Whilst it was not the subject of submissions, and although it is rendered immaterial in light of the views that I have reached regarding Hussein's appeal, it should be noted that there was also an error by the sentencing judge in the sentence imposed in respect of count 7. 
12The offending in that count was contrary to s. 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 which prescribes a standard non parole period of 3 years. Section 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act permits the Court to decline to set a non-parole period when sentencing an offender, but that section does not apply to an offence for which a standard non-parole is prescribed (see SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]-[78] (per Kirby J, Hodgson JA and Hislop J concurring); Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213; Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34; Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77; Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95). In these circumstances, the sentencing judge's imposition of a fixed term of imprisonment in respect of count 7 was an error. 

The applicant Barghachoun
13The following sentences were imposed upon Barghachoun: 





Offence 

Sentence


Counts 1 and 2

On each count, a fixed term of two years imprisonment commencing on 20 August 2012 and expiring on 19 August 2014.


Count 3

A fixed term of 6 years imprisonment commencing on 20 August 2012 and expiring on 19 August 2018. 


Count 4

A fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year commencing on 20 August 2012 and expiring on 19 August 2013.


Count 6

A non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 20 August 2013 and expiring on 19 February 2019, with a balance of term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 20 February 2019 and expiring on 19 February 2022.


Count 10

A fixed term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 20 August 2011 and expiring on 19 February 2013. 

14The total effective sentence imposed upon Barghachoun was a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months commencing on 20 August 2011 and expiring on 19 February 2019, with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 20 February 2019 and expiring on 19 February 2022. 

THE PRESENT APPEALS
15The following matters are before this Court for determination: 
(i)an application by Manly for leave to appeal against his convictions in respect of counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9; 

(ii)an appeal by the Crown against what is said to be the manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed upon Manly following those convictions;

(iii)an application by Hussein for leave to appeal against his convictions in respect of counts 4, 7 and 8;

(iv)an application by Hussein for leave to appeal against sentence; and

(v)an application by Barghachoun for leave to appeal against sentence. 

16Manly and Hussein each assert that the verdicts of the jury in respect of those particular counts which are the subject of their respective applications were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence. Because such a ground does not involve a question of law alone, Manly and Hussein each require leave to appeal (see Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s. 5(1) and Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [12] per Johnson J, Basten JA and R S Hulme J agreeing). For the reasons more fully set out below, I propose that leave be granted in each case.

17It should also be noted that Hussein requires an extension of time to lodge his Notice of Appeal. That extension was not opposed by the Crown.

THE CROWN CASE
18In very broad terms, the Crown alleged that a plan was devised by the offenders to steal a motor vehicle in Sydney, drive that stolen vehicle to the area of Bulahdelah, and rob a truck which had left Sydney on the evening of 19 August 2011 carrying (inter alia) a quantity of mobile telephone equipment. The evidence in support of that case, which was entirely circumstantial, may be summarised as follows. 

Counts 1 and 2
19Evidence given by Adam Naje at a previous trial was read to the jury (commencing at T128). Mr Naje said that on the evening of 19 August 2011 he was at a BP Service Station in Silverwater filling his father's shuttle bus. Exhibit X (at AB218) is a map of the Silverwater area which shows the BP service station at the corner of Silverwater Road and Egerton Street. 

20Mr Naje described (commencing at T128 L35) being approached by a person (who on the Crown case was Hussein) wearing a hooded top who asked him for the keys to the vehicle. Another person (on the Crown case Barghachoun) then jumped in the driver's side of the bus. Without handing over the keys, Mr Naje ran into the shop at the service station and locked himself in a room at the back (at T131 L5). He remained there for 10 to 15 minutes before coming out and calling 000 (Exhibit F). Mr Naje was not able to say what the first man who approached him was wearing on the bottom half of his body (at T129 L12).

21Having been unsuccessful in taking Mr Naje's vehicle, the persons alleged by the Crown to be Hussein and Barghachoun then turned their attention to a black BMW sedan which was in the forecourt of the service station being filled by Adrian So. Mr So gave evidence (commencing at T43 L1) that he saw two men approaching the service station. He said that he saw one of them approach the passenger's side of Mr Naje's bus whilst the other approached the driver's side. He said that both men were wearing dark ""hoodies"", and that one of them (on the Crown case, Hussein) was also wearing covering from the nose down (at T45 L9). He was not able to see what that person was wearing on his bottom half (at T45 L36). 
22Mr So said that there was a sudden scream before he saw Mr Naje run inside the shop adjacent to the service station (at T44 L41 and following). He said that one of the men (on the Crown case, Hussein) then ran and attempted to gain access to the shop (at T45 L40-44).

23Mr So said that the other man (on the Crown case, Barghachoun) then approached him and asked him for his keys whilst trying to open the door of his car (at T45 L43). Mr So then said that the man who had the face covering came over and that he had a gun in his hand (at T47 L35). Mr So did not hand over his keys. He then observed the two men walk towards Egerton Street (at T 47 L32) before calling 000 at 9.19 pm (Exhibit A, T 49 and 481). 

24The two service station attendants who were working on that evening, a Mr Shanmughanathan and Mr Devineni, gave evidence which was generally consistent with that given by Mr Naje and Mr So. In terms of the time at which the incident occurred, there was evidence that at 9.18 pm a call was initiated by a 000 operator to the service station which lasted 3 minutes and 54 seconds, concluding at 9.22 pm. On the evidence that was a call between the 000 operator and Mr So. A 000 call was received from Mr Naje at 9.25 pm and lasted for 4 minutes and 1 second, concluding at 9.29 pm. It follows that the incident occurred at or around 9.15 pm.

25CCTV footage of the incident was tendered by the Crown (Exhibit DD). The Court was provided with that footage and I have viewed it several times. It variously shows two men, both wearing hooded tops, walking across the forecourt of the service station and approaching Mr Naje's shuttle bus. One of them, alleged to be Hussein, is wearing camouflage pants, whilst the other is wearing dark pants which appear to have writing down one leg. Their faces are not clearly visible. Moreover in my view, it is not possible from the footage itself to determine what, if anything, the person alleged to have been Hussein may have been carrying in his hand. 
26It was not suggested by the Crown that the CCTV footage depicted Manly and he was not otherwise identified as having been present at the service station. On the Crown case, Manly was nearby in his motor vehicle playing what was said to be a supportive role for Hussein and Barghachoun. In support of its case against Manly on these counts, the Crown placed particular reliance upon inferences to be drawn from a telephone call which was recorded as having been received at 9.10 pm on a mobile telephone used by Manly, and which had passed through a particular telecommunications tower. I have dealt with this issue in more detail below. 

Count 3 
27By reference to Exhibit X, if one proceeds north along Silverwater Road from Egerton Street (i.e. from the location of the BP service station) the next intersecting street is Fariola Street which runs generally parallel to Egerton Street. Making a right hand turn from Silverwater Road into Fariola Street leads to Wetherill Street North (Exhibit M4; T463) where the Vittoria Coffee Warehouse marked on Exhibit X is located (""the warehouse""). 

28On the evening of 19 August 2011 Kamel Bakri went to work as a security guard at the warehouse. He recalled arriving at about 9.00 pm in a silver Mazda vehicle which belonged to his business partner (at T403 L34). He explained that there was a sliding gate and a boom gate at the entrance to the warehouse premises (T405 L40). There was (inter alia) a lap top computer in the vehicle, along with an amount of cash.

29Mr Bakri gave evidence (commencing at T407 L12) that when he was waiting for the gate to open, someone knocked and opened the door of his vehicle saying ""Leave your car, I need your car"". He described hearing ""the cracking of a gun"" although he could not see what the person who spoke to him was holding (at T408 L45). Mr Bakri then got out of his car and the person jumped in and reversed straight away before driving off. 

30Mr Bakri could provide little in the way of a description of the person who had ordered him from his car. He had a partial view of the person's cheeks, which he described as having ""like pimples"" (at T410 L22). He described the person (commencing at T421 L28) as wearing cargo pants which were light in colour. He said (at T422 L26) that he could not remember if the pants had a pattern but agreed (at T422 L29) that he said nothing about a pattern when he called 000 (Exhibit Y; T419; T480). He later viewed 20 photographs shown to him by police but was not able to identify the person who had ordered him from his car (at T425 L32-47). He also agreed (at T425 L16-30) that he heard the cracking of a gun but did not actually see any firearm.

31Mr Bakri also gave evidence (commencing at T412 L29) that he saw another car which had parked behind, and about 3 metres to the right of, his vehicle after he had stopped at the boom gate. On the Crown case, that was a blue Subaru vehicle driven by Manly. Mr Bakri was asked to describe that car and gave the following evidence (commencing at T412 L46):

Q Can you describe that vehicle?
A It was a dark blue colour.
Q Yes?
A And I don't know what model it was back then but I said it was like a Golf, a Volkswagen, like the new shape, the one ones because, and maybe it looks like a WRX. The both of them, these two cars, looked the same.
Q Okay, well you just tell us what you remember? You remember it being a blue - a dark blue colour?
A A dark blue colour. I don't know nothing else. I can't remember nothing.
Q So you are not able to say what make it was?
A No, they - because they drove off straight away.
...
Q At the time when the blue car drove away --
A Have a big exhaust, sports exhaust.

Q Okay, all right, it had a big sports exhaust?
A Yes, its loud, sorry, yes.
Q Is there anything else you remember about that car?
A No, not really.

32When cross examined (at T430 L41) Mr Bakri agreed that he had told the 000 operator that the blue vehicle he had seen was a hatchback. When asked whether this reflected his initial impression of the vehicle, Mr Bakri said (at T430 L45):

""Can't really say because I'm telling you it was wet like you saw, and dark so I couldn't see anything"".

33When asked whether his initial impression was that the vehicle was more like a Golf than a Subaru, Mr Bakri said (at T431 L6):

""Can't say anything but the thing is why I thought it's a Golf because the colour of it and I know someone that's got the same colour car you know what I mean, that's why I say it looked like a Golf, that's all"".

34There was CCTV footage from the warehouse tendered before the jury in the form of two separate CDs which became Exhibits B and C (although it is noted that when the CDs were originally tendered (at T96 and T98 respectively) the transcript records them as having been marked Exhibits ""2"" and ""3"" which is obviously incorrect). Both were produced by Jodan Tran, the IT Manager at the warehouse. They were played to this Court in the course of the hearing and I have since viewed each of them several times. 

35Exhibit B is of 3 minutes and 3 seconds duration. Bearing in mind the evidence given by Mr Tran and Mr Bakri when Exhibit B was played to each of them when giving evidence at the trial, what can be seen on the footage may be summarised as follows: 

(i)for the first 38 seconds the camera is trained upon a partially open roller door to the right of screen;
(ii)at the 39 second mark a male in a yellow fluorescent vest (identified by Mr Bakri (commencing at T419 L15) and Mr Tran (at T95 L13) as a security guard) is seen to walk from right to left pointing towards something across to the left which is not in view. He then appears to pause, lift his right arm and point to the left before turning around and moving back from left to right and out of view;
(iii)at the 47 second mark, a moving shadow can be seen on the left of the screen, consistent with the security guard having just opened a gate with a remote control; 
(iv)after the security guard disappears from view, the camera remains trained upon the view described in (i);
(v)at 1 minute and 43 seconds Mr Bakri (who is identified at T419 L2) appears and walks from left to right speaking on a mobile telephone. The camera thereafter remains trained upon the view described in (i) until the end.

36Exhibit C is of 3 minutes and 1 second duration. The footage is taken from a still, but apparently elevated, camera and depicts (from a distance) a car park area described by Mr Tran (at T94 L41) as being located ""just to the left"" of the camera from which the footage in Exhibit B was taken. The footage in Exhibit C depicts the car park area in the foreground with two boom gates in the background, one to the left and another to the right. Wetherill Street (identified by Mr Bakri at T427 L39) runs behind the boom gates. What can be seen from viewing Exhibit C may be summarised as follows:
(i)at the 14 second mark a car drives along Wetherill Street from left to right and turns into the driveway to face the boom gate on the right. The glare from the headlights, along with the circumstances in which the footage was taken, do not enable me to determine the colour, make or model of the vehicle, although other evidence establishes that it is the Mazda vehicle driven by Mr Bakri; 
(ii)at 1 minute and 32 seconds another car (""the second car""), alleged by the Crown to be the blue Subaru vehicle driven by Manly, travels along Wetherill Street from right to left before coming to a stop behind, but slightly to the left of, Mr Bakri's car which is still stopped facing the boom gate on the right; 
(iii)at 1 minute and 48 seconds the boom gate on the right is seen to rise, but Mr Bakri's Mazda remains stationary and does not enter the car park; 
(iv)at 2 minutes and 17 seconds the second car moves off to the left along Wetherill Street;
(v)at 2 minutes and 22 seconds Mr Bakri's Mazda reverses on to the roadway and follows the second car;
(vi)at 2 minutes and 27 seconds Mr Bakri is seen standing on the footpath before walking into the car park through the open boom gate and across to the right;
(vii)at 2 minutes and 54 seconds the boom gate lowers, at which point a separate steel gate can be viewed closing simultaneously. 

37Although it is possible to conclude from viewing Exhibit C that the car alleged to be that of Manly is blue, it is not possible to determine the make or model. Indeed, the Crown Prosecutor in his opening address said to the jury (at T25 L10 to L16):

"".... the Crown case is that this was Mr Manly's blue Subaru WRX being driven by Mr Manly. Again the Crown does not say that you could identify it as that car based just on Mr Bakri's evidence or the CCTV footage, the Crown asks you to draw an inference based on all of the circumstances including all of the subsequent events and evidence that I will come to"" (my emphasis). 

38The Crown case was that having left the warehouse, the silver Mazda carrying Hussein and Barghachoun, and the blue Subaru driven by Manly, with (at some point) Riley as a passenger, commenced to travel north along the Pacific Highway to Bulahdelah. In order to establish that the two vehicles travelled to Bulahdelah, the Crown relied on the telephone evidence discussed below.

Count 4
39Debbie Lucas gave evidence (commencing at T104) that at approximately 1.30 pm on 19 August 2011 she parked her vehicle at the F3 café on the Pacific Highway north of Sydney, where she worked. On the following day, she realised that the number plates (BL71GG) were missing from her vehicle. The Crown relied upon inferences to be drawn from the telephone evidence to establish that whilst the Subaru containing Manly and Riley kept travelling north, the silver Mazda containing Hussein and Barghachoun stopped along the highway for a period of time. The Crown alleged that during this period of time, Hussein and Barghachoun stole the number plates from Ms Lucas' vehicle. Those number plates were on the Mazda vehicle when it was found burned out in Bulahdelah some hours later. 

Count 6 
40Norman Evans gave evidence that he left a Bankstown freight depot in his truck on the evening of 19 August 2011 and drove north. His destination was Clybucca. When he reached the southern outskirts of the township of Bulahdelah he slowed down due to road works. At that time he noticed what he described as a small silver car parked at the side of the road (at T166 L15). As he entered the township of Bulahdelah the silver car then overtook him at a speed he thought was about 80-90 km/h. He could not see the occupants of the car (at T167 L20). 

41Having passed through Bulahdelah, Mr Evans was descending a hill on the northern side of the town when the silver car which had earlier passed him pulled out from the left hand side and stopped directly in front of him (at T168 L4 to L33). Mr Evans said (commencing at T169 L2) that a man ran in front of the truck, opened the driver's side door and ordered him to get out. Mr Evans got out and went to walk around the back. He was directed to the front and got down on his knees, at which time the person who ordered him out fired a shot into the ground. On the Crown case, the person who fired the shot was Hussein. 
42Mr Evans said (commencing at T169 L34) that when he got out of the truck he left the driver's door open, and that when he was down on his knees he heard what sounded like the door closing. He then heard the back doors of the truck opening (at T170 L5). Mr Evans looked towards the back of the truck and saw what he described as a ""set of legs"" between the tray of the truck and the roadway (at T170 L26 to 32). 

43Mr Evans then noticed the headlights of cars that had pulled up behind his truck. He said (commencing at T170 L38) that the person who had directed him out of the truck ""fired a couple of shots into the ground and told (the drivers of those other cars) to fuck off"". The cars then left. 

44Mr Evans said (commencing at T 171 L7) that he heard the back doors of the truck closing and (at T171 L24) that he ""thought"" that the man with the gun walked back down and entered the passenger side of the truck. He then heard the truck ""kangarooing"" down the street before hearing the sound of the back door swinging open and hitting the side of the truck. Mr Evans then gave evidence (commencing at T171 L34) that it sounded as if ""the passenger had got out of the truck again, gone back to close the door and at the same time another couple of cars had pulled up behind the truck again ..... he has fired another couple of shots into the ground and told them to leave abruptly .... And then they closed the door, he has come back down, they left, he has come back down, got in the truck and then they left"". 

45It should be noted that the Crown case was that Hussein fired the shots but that Mr Evans' truck was driven away carrying Barghachoun and Riley. Mr Evans' evidence (in [44] above) that the man who had fired the shots entered the truck immediately before it was driven away was not consistent with the Crown case. 

46Mr Evans was not able to see the face of the person who had ordered him out of the car. He described him as wearing a ""hoodie"", along with a scarf which covered from the bottom of his nose downwards, and carrying a greyish coloured gun in his right hand. He was not able to see what the person was wearing on his bottom half (T172 L28 to T 173 L29). 

47One of the vehicles which pulled up whilst Mr Evans was on the ground was driven by Robert Frame, who gave evidence that as he was travelling north along the Pacific Highway he saw a white truck, behind which a silver Commodore vehicle was stopped. Mr Frame stopped behind the Commodore and noticed that the back doors of the truck were closed (at T83 L45). He described (at T83 L48 to T84 L40) two men jump out of the back of the truck, one of whom was carrying a pistol in his right hand (at T85 L18). He said that this man ordered him away and fired three shots, one into the air and two into the ground (at T85 L46). He described the man with the gun as wearing camouflaged jeans (at T 85 L17). 

48Mr Evans left the scene immediately upon the shots being fired (at T85 L45 to T86 L 3). He was not in a position to see where the person with the gun may have gone after the shots were fired.

49Another of the motorists who stopped behind the truck was Glenn Hannaford. Mr Hannaford gave evidence (commencing at T199 L9) that he and his wife had been driving through Raymond Terrace earlier in the evening at which time a silver Mazda sedan had overtaken them at an estimated speed of 150km/h. Mr Hannaford was not able to see the occupants. He said that he then passed what he thought was the same car stopped by the side of the road further north along the highway (at T199 L36-40) after which it passed him again at about the same speed. He was again not able to see the occupants (at T200 L35). 

50Mr Hannaford said (commencing at T 200 L45) that when he reached the northern side of Buladelah he saw a white truck stopped in the middle of the road and the silver Mazda which had earlier passed him parked in front of it. He stopped his vehicle immediately behind the truck. He saw that the doors were closed but said (at T201 L30 to 40) that he saw a leg come out of the back of the truck and then go back in, from which he concluded that there was someone inside. He then saw another person get out of the passenger side of the truck and approach his car. According to Mr Hannaford, that person produced a gun and fired it before ordering him away (at T202 L1-13). He described the gunman (commencing at T 202 L25) as being covered from head to toe wearing a hooded jacket, with something dark covering his face from the nose down, and cargo type pants with green army camouflage. 

51As was the case with Mr Frame, Mr Hannaford left the scene as soon as the shots were fired and could not determine where the person with the gun may have gone.

52Mr Hannaford's wife also gave evidence (commencing at T 217). Her account of the silver Mazda passing their vehicle was consistent with that of her husband. However according to Mrs Hannaford, when she and her husband stopped behind the truck the left rear door was open and she saw a man running from the right side of the truck and then get into the back (at T 219 L44 to T220 L14). She said (commencing at T 221 L25) that she then saw another man come from the right hand side towards her vehicle. The man was completely covered and when he had reached a point approximately 3 metres from her vehicle, he pulled out a gun and fired a shot into the ground before ordering her and her husband away (at T222 L8-27). She could not further describe him. 

Count 9 
53Graham Reddon, the publican of a hotel in Bulahdelah, gave evidence (commencing at T234) that when driving a number of patrons home in his courtesy bus on the evening of 19 August 2011 he saw a ""big orange glow"" at the corner of Prince Street and Stuart Street, Bulahdelah. He also gave evidence (commencing at T 235 L44) that when he was returning to the hotel at about 12:40 am on 20 August 2011 he saw a blue Subaru WRX vehicle driving around the streets of Bulahdelah which ""would have had gold coloured mag wheels sort of thing and it was an extremely noisy vehicle ... like some sort of a rally car sort of thing"" (at T236 L28-32). He was not able to see the occupants of the vehicle. About 20 minutes after he had first seen it, he saw the vehicle again when it was stopped by police. 

54A resident of Bulahdelah, Karen Bruton, gave evidence (commencing at T229 L10) that she was awoken late on the evening of 19 August by what she described as a ""very loud boom"", followed by a second boom about thirty seconds to a minute later. She went outside and saw what she thought was a late model car well alight. She said that she thought it looked silver, although she could not be sure. Another resident, Katrina Campbell, gave evidence (commencing at T713 L33) at about midnight she heard a car being driven around the streets for approximately half an hour which sounded like it had a hole in the muffler. 

55Hussein and Manly were both convicted of count 9. There is no direct evidence which places either of them at the scene of the destruction of the Mazda.

Count 10
56Between about 11.30 pm and 11.35 pm Gary Pol, who had been working as a security guard at premises located about 2.5 km north of Bulahdelah and 50 m off the Pacific Highway, saw Mr Evans' truck come around the corner and stop 20 m from the highway. He saw the driver get out and appear to do something with the truck's headlights before getting into the back of the truck for about 30 seconds and then going back and entering the driver's side before turning the lights off (commencing at T373). He then noticed the truck making its way, at speed, towards a nearby cul-de-sac (at T375 L5-9). 

57Police were later directed by Mr Pol to the area in which he had last seen the truck. The truck was located on an access road, having become bogged in a u-turn bay. It was the Crown case that the truck was driven to that location by Barghachoun and Riley and that they then stole a bus belonging to a local sawmill and drove it to Forster. They were arrested a short time later.

Subsequent events
58At about 1.00 am on 20 August 2011 police observed Manly in the driver's seat of a blue Subaru vehicle, with Hussein in the passenger seat, in the township of Bulahdelah. When asked what they were doing there Manly replied ""We're just waiting for a friend of mine"". When asked who the friend was and where was he coming from, Manly replied ""Oh just a friend, he's coming from over there"", at which time he gestured vaguely towards the Pacific Highway (commencing at T246 L43). 

59Police then searched both Manly and Hussein, as well as the vehicle. Manly was wearing a red top, blue jeans and white shoes. Hussein was wearing a grey windcheater, grey pants and white runners (commencing at T251 L4). In the course of the search of the vehicle, two mobile telephones were found between the driver's seat and the centre console area. 

60On 24 September 2011 Joy Turnbull was cutting the grass in a property next door to her home in Alexander Street, Bulahdelah at which time she discovered a gun (commencing at T477). The gun was seized by the police and identified as a Browning Pistol. Expert evidence given by a Mr Potgieter established that spent cartridges which had been found by police on the Pacific Highway had been fired from the gun found by Ms Turnbull. 
Other evidence
61The Crown called John Abassi, a self employed truck driver, who gave evidence (commencing at T 339 L1) that he had known Barghachoun for between 3 and 9 months. He said that Barghachoun had asked him about ""collecting a load that he needed picked up"" and that they spoke on 19 August, when Mr Abassi asked whether Barghachoun wanted to come with him to Grafton, suggesting that they could collect Barghachoun's goods on their return. According to Mr Abassi, Barghachoun had said he was ""busy"". Mr Abassi made the trip but encountered difficulties with his truck overheating, which resulted in him making numerous calls to Barghachoun during the course of the evening of 19 August 2011. 

62Soil samples were taken from various locations including the inside of Mr Evans' truck, the area where his truck was found to be parked, the area in which the spent cartridges were found and the area in which the gun was found. These were compared with samples taken from soil on the underside of (inter alia) Hussein's shoes which were taken from him at the time of his arrest. Professor Robert Fitzpatrick gave evidence (commencing at T587) of his analysis of these various samples and his results were recorded in a summary which was tendered (Exhibit UU). His conclusions included the following: 

(i)there was a limited degree of comparability between the soil found on Hussein's shoes, and that found on the shoes of Barghachoun and Riley;
(ii)there was a limited degree of comparability between the soil found on Hussein's shoes and the sample taken from the access road where Mr Evans' truck was located;
(iii)there was a very strong degree of comparability between the soil found on Hussein's shoes and the sample taken from the area in which the gun was located;
(iv)there was a very strong degree of comparability between the soil found on Hussein's shoes and the samples taken from an area near where the gun was found, and an area near to that in which the silver Mazda was found to be burned out.

63Police executed a search warrant at Manly's home on 11 October 2011. They found a certificate of registration for a 1999 Subaru vehicle in Manly's name. Also tendered in the Crown case was a document certifying that the vehicle was a blue sedan. The transfer history of the vehicle established that it had been acquired by Barghachoun and then transferred to Manly on 5 July 2011. 

The telephone evidence
64As I have previously noted, the Crown relied upon evidence of telephone contact between the four offenders in support of its circumstantial case. That evidence is summarised in the following table, which includes the evidence of the various 000 calls, and which was compiled in part from the telephone records produced by various witnesses:

Specific telephone evidence relevant to Manly
65I have already noted (at [26] above) the nature of the Crown case against Manly in respect of counts 1 and 2. There was no direct evidence of Manly's presence at the BP service station. The Crown sought to infer his presence, and his commission of those offences, from the following facts: 

(i)at 9.10 pm on 11 August 2011, Manly received a telephone call from an unknown source;
(ii)the call was of 5 seconds duration and was diverted to voicemail; 
(iii)the call was logged as having passed through a tower nominated as ""Ermington""; and
(iv)that tower was proximate to the BP service station.

66In the course of the hearing of the appeal, senior counsel for Manly addressed the Court at some length in relation to this evidence. However, it became apparent that senior counsel (who did not appear at the trial) may have been mistaken in his understanding of what the evidence actually demonstrated. It also transpired that submissions which had been advanced by the Crown in relation to such evidence may have been based upon an incorrect premise. In these circumstances, the parties were asked at the conclusion of the hearing to give further consideration to the matter with a view to communicating an agreed position to the Court. A further document was then provided to the Court in which the parties, by agreement, drew attention to evidence given by two particular witnesses, namely Detective George, the officer in charge of the investigation, and Petine Tuhukuva, an analyst from Vodaphone Telecommunications. 

67The evidence of Detective George to which the Court's attention was drawn may be summarised as follows:

(i)in cross-examination (commencing at T751) Detective George said (at T752 L6) that there were three mobile telephone towers located in Ermington;
(ii)on a document which became Exhibit M3, he marked each of those towers with the letter ""X"" (at T752 L11);
(iii)one of those towers which was near the intersection of Silverwater Road and Victoria Road, and which was the southernmost tower of the three, was additionally marked by Detective George with a circle (at T752 L23);
(iv)there were three towers in Silverwater, each of which was located to the south of the towers at Ermington, and each of which was marked by Detective George on Exhibit M3 with the letter ""S"" (at T752 L30-39);
(v)Detective George was then shown three further documents (commencing at T753 L5) which became Exhibit M4;
(vi)by reference to one of the documents in Exhibit M4 (reproduced at AB 463) he identified the locations of the two northernmost towers at Silverwater as:
(a)Newington Road, near Holker Street; and
(b)Day Street, North Silverwater.

68Petine Tuhukuva produced various call charge records which were marked Exhibit XX. To the extent which is relevant for present purposes, those records are summarised in the table at [64] above. The evidence of Ms Tuhukuva to which the Court's attention was drawn included the following:

(i)towers are ascribed a name according to the suburb in which they are located (at T704 L29-34);
(ii)there are two towers in Ermington (at T709 L22);
(iii)there are two towers in Silverwater, one nominated as ""Silverwater"" and the other nominated as ""Silverwater V"" (at T709 L25-34).

69However Ms Tukuhuva also gave the following evidence (at T704 L13-21):

Q The time zone code, what does that relate to?
A That relates to the time zone that we have recorded and the local call start time, so where it's New South Wales it's in New South Wales local time, where it's STD it's eastern standard time which does not include daylight savings.
Q Does that necessarily correlate - we're going to get to the tower that the call went through, does that necessarily correlate with the tower that the call went through?
A Not necessarily, no.

70The last question in that passage was wholly confusing. Along with the answer, it conveys two possible conclusions, namely:

(i)that a particular call did not necessarily pass through the stated tower at the nominated time; or

(ii)(ii) that the tower which is nominated was not necessarily the tower through which the call passed. 

71Whichever of those two conclusions might be reached, an issue as to the reliability of this evidence necessarily arises. 

72Quite apart from the question of reliability, the evidence of Detective George on the one hand and Ms Tukuhuva on the other, was contradictory in two particular respects. Firstly, the evidence of Detective George was that there were three towers in Ermington. According to Ms Tukuhuva, there were two. Secondly, Detective George gave evidence that there were three towers in Silverwater. Again, according to Ms Tukuhuva, there were two. None of these issues were further addressed. 

73I have already noted the significance, from the point of view of the Crown case against Manly, which attached to the evidence surrounding the call received on Manly's telephone at 9.10 pm on 19 August 2011. That evidence was left in a most unsatisfactory state, to the point where a serious issue arises as to whether it was capable of sustaining the inference that the Crown sought to draw. I have discussed this further below. 

THE APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION OF MANLY 
The grounds of appeal
74Although expressed as 5 separate grounds, Manly advanced what was effectively a single ground of appeal, namely that verdicts of the jury in respect of each of the 5 counts of which he was convicted were unreasonable, and could not be supported by the evidence. 

The submissions on behalf of Manly
75The fundamental proposition advanced by senior counsel for Manly was that there was no evidence which established Manly's presence at the scene of any of the offences, and that the Crown case was essentially based upon suspicion. 

76Bearing in mind that the Crown advanced a circumstantial case against Manly, senior counsel submitted that the evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of that case did not exclude the reasonable hypothesis that Manly had simply been asked to meet Hussein for what he (Manly) thought was an innocent purpose. He submitted that the evidence was incapable of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, Manly's presence at the scene, his knowledge of the offences or his participation in them. 

77In oral submissions, senior counsel placed particular emphasis on what he submitted was the lack of evidence to establish Manly's commission of the offences in counts 1 and 2. He highlighted, in particular, the absence of any identification of Manly or his vehicle at the BP service station, and submitted that when properly analysed, the evidence of the telephone call received by Manly at 9.10 pm tended completely against the proposition that he was nearby. Senior counsel also submitted that if the evidence was not sufficient to establish Manly's commission of the offending in counts 1 and 2, it followed, because of the way in which the Crown put its case, that the Crown was not able to establish the commission, by Manly, of any of the remaining offences with which he was charged. 

78In terms of count 3, senior counsel emphasised the shortcomings of the evidence of Mr Bakri in terms of his identification of the second car which arrived in Wetherill Street. He also relied on the evidence of Mr Reddon that the Subaru observed in Buladelah had gold wheels, and submitted that the CCTV footage from the warehouse showed a vehicle with silver wheels. As to that second submission, I should say that having viewed that CCTV footage on several occasions, and in circumstances where it was taken in an elevated position, from a distance, and at night, it is impossible to reach a conclusion about the colour of the wheels on the second car. 

79In terms of counts 6 and 9 senior counsel again emphasised that there was no direct evidence which placed Manly at the scene of the commission of either offence. He submitted that the mere fact that Manly was found in the nearby area in his vehicle a short time later, even when combined with the other circumstances upon which the Crown relied, was insufficient to establish his commission of those offences. 

The submissions on behalf of the Crown
80The Crown emphasised the necessity to view the circumstantial case against Manly as a whole and submitted that:

(i)the evidence supported the conclusion that Manly was ""in the vicinity"" of the BP service station at the relevant time, consistent with his alleged role as a support driver for Hussein and Barghachoun;
(ii)there was evidence of a blue car which had a loud exhaust being present at the warehouse, from which it could be inferred that it was Manly's vehicle;
(iii)the ongoing communications between Manly and Barghachoun, and the areas in which those communications took place, supported a conclusion that the four offenders effectively travelled in convoy from Sydney to Buladelah;
(iv)there was evidence of a blue Subaru with a loud exhaust being driven in Buladelah shortly after the commission of the offences, from which it was open to infer it was Manly's vehicle; and 
(v)there was evidence that Hussein and Manly were in each other's company in a vehicle of that description at Bulahdelah following the commission of the offences. 

81It was submitted that when this evidence was considered as a whole there was a ""strong circumstantial case"" against Manly. The document which was provided by the Crown to the Court following the conclusion of the hearing further submitted that the evidence of Detective George and Ms Tukuhuva represented ""one piece of the circumstantial evidence connecting Mr Manly to the offences"". 

82More importantly, the document provided by the Crown contained two important concessions, namely: 

(i)the tower marked by Detective George with a circle on Exhibit M3 was not the Ermington tower through which the call received on Manly's telephone at 9.10 pm on 19 August 2011 passed; and

(ii)there was no evidence as to which of the other two towers at Ermington was the tower through which the call passed. 

Consideration and conclusion
83In determining the appeal brought by Manly (as well as the appeal against conviction brought by Hussein) the question for this Court is whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied of the commission of the offences in question beyond reasonable doubt. The approach to be adopted in determining this question was set out by the High Court in M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 and following:

"".... The question which the court must ask itself if whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must be pay full regard to those considerations. In most cases, a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"".

84The test in M (supra) was restated by the High Court in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606. The application of such test requires this Court to make an independent assessment of the totality of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality (see Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; (2011) 210 A Crim R 326 at [37] per Johnson J, Macfarlan JA and Garling J agreeing). Bearing in mind that the Crown case was a circumstantial one, the evidence must, as the Crown submitted, be considered in its totality and not in a piecemeal fashion (see R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618). 

85For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Manly committed any of the offences alleged against him. 

86In terms of counts 1 and 2, I am not able to accept the Crown's submission that the evidence supported a conclusion that Manly was in the vicinity of the BP service station at the time of the offending. On the contrary, in my view an analysis of the evidence tends completely against that proposition for a number of reasons.

87To begin with, and for the reasons I have already expressed, there is a serious issue as to the reliability of the evidence surrounding the call received on Manly's phone at 9.10 pm on 19 August 2011, in terms of the time of the call, and/or the location of Manly's telephone when the call was received. However, even if I was prepared to accept that the evidence was reliable in either or both of those respects, the evidence does not, on a close analysis, sustain that the inference that Manly was in the vicinity of the BP service station at the time of the commission of the offending in counts 1 and 2. 

88Accepting the evidence given by Detective George, all of the three towers in Ermington are, by reference to Exhibit M3, located generally to the north of the BP service station, which is at Silverwater. The agreed position of the parties is that of those three towers, the call received by Manly at 9:10pm did not pass through the southernmost tower, that being the tower marked with an ""X"" and a circle on Exhibit M3. The two remaining Ermington towers are located further to the north of, and some distance from, the BP service station. The evidence does not enable me to reach a conclusion as to the precise distance but it is evident from Exhibit M3 that it is not insubstantial. 

89Further, and again accepting the evidence of Detective George, the three towers in Silverwater are all far closer to the BP service station than any of the towers in Ermington. As a matter of common sense, if Manly was in fact in the vicinity of the BP service station at the time alleged by the Crown, a call to his phone would have been expected to pass through one of the towers identified by Detective George as being located in Silverwater, rather than through one of two towers located some distance to the north in Ermington. 

90In these circumstances, the Crown's submission that the evidence connects Manly to the commission of the offences cannot be accepted. The evidence tends entirely against the proposition that Manly was in the vicinity of the BP Service Station in a supportive role when the call was received on his phone at 9.10 pm. To the extent that the evidence is capable of sustaining any inference (bearing in mind my earlier observations as to its general unreliability) it is that at the material time, Manly was in Ermington, not Silverwater.

91In terms of count 3, and in respect of the identification of the second car, the evidence establishes nothing more than the presence of a blue car at the warehouse. The Crown can draw no comfort from the evidence of Mr Bakri in this regard. He initially described the vehicle as a Golf. He gave evidence that ""maybe it looks like a WRX"". He said at one point it was a hatchback (a completely different shape to the vehicle which was later seen to be driven by Manly). He then agreed in cross-examination that the prevailing conditions were such that ""he couldn't see anything"". 

92Further, and in any event, there was no evidence which placed Manly at the scene of the offending in count 3, much less evidence which established participation in the commission of that offence. In particular, and leaving aside the fact that the evidence did not establish the make or model of the vehicle, and also leaving aside the fact that one of the descriptions of Mr Bakri of the vehicle's shape (i.e. a hatchback) was inconsistent with the shape of the vehicle in which Manly was stopped by police later in the evening, there was no evidence of who was driving the blue vehicle at the time of the offending in count 3. The evidence did not exclude the possibility that it was being driven by Barghachoun. The fact that Manly was seen to be driving a blue vehicle with a loud exhaust some hours later does not lead to a conclusion that this was the same vehicle present at the offending in count 3 or, if it was, that Manly was driving it at the time. 

93Finally, there is no direct evidence which supports the presence of Manly at the offending in counts 6 and 9. The mere fact that there is evidence that Manly effectively travelled in convoy to Bulahdelah with Barghachoun and Hussein, and that he was found by police in Hussein's presence in the township of Bulahdelah early on the morning of 20 August 2011, falls substantially short of sustaining an inference that Manly was even present at the time of the commission of counts 6 and 9, much less that he participated in that offending. 

94In my view, at its highest, the evidence against Manly established the following: 

(i)Manly was known to one or more of his co-offenders;
(ii)a blue vehicle with a loud exhaust was seen at the warehouse; 
(iii)Manly travelled towards Buladelah at or about the same time as his alleged co-offenders; 
(iv)a blue Subaru with a loud exhaust was seen driving in Buladelah late on the evening of 19 August 2011;
(v)Manly and Hussein, whilst in a blue Subaru vehicle, were spoken to by police in Buladelah in the early hours of 20 August 2011. 

95It may be that those circumstances arouse suspicion. However in my view, they fall short of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, the commission of any offence by Manly. 

96Given the view that I have reached it is not necessary to consider the appeal by the Crown against what was said to be the manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed upon Manly.

THE APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION OF HUSSEIN
The grounds of appeal
97Hussein's appeal against conviction was limited to the convictions which were recorded against him in respect of counts 4, 7 and 8. Count 4 alleged the theft of Ms. Lucas' number plates, whilst counts 7 and 8 alleged the unauthorised use of, and the causing of danger with, a firearm. In each case, the sole ground of appeal was that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence.

The submissions on behalf of Hussein
98Counsel's written submissions commenced with a consideration of the evidence to support count 4. It was submitted that although the telephone evidence, and in particular the evidence as to communications between Barghachoun and Manly, was capable of supporting that they travelled north from Sydney at about the same time with Hussein, there was no evidence which established which of the two vehicles Hussein was travelling in at the time. Counsel submitted that even if an inference were drawn that the Subaru vehicle driven by Manly continued to travel north when the silver Mazda stopped at the F3 café, there was no evidence to establish that Hussein was even travelling in the Mazda. Counsel further submitted that even if such an inference were somehow drawn, there was simply no evidence to establish that Hussein was responsible for the theft of the number plates.

99In respect of counts 7 and 8, counsel submitted that the primary issue was whether or not the evidence established that Hussein was the person who was described as wearing camouflage pants. He submitted that if this conclusion could not be reached, it followed that Hussein was not the person responsible for discharging the firearm. It also followed, counsel submitted, that there was no other evidence of Hussein's involvement in the offences other than the fact that he was present in Manly's vehicle after such offences had been committed. 

100Counsel also made particular reference to the evidence of Mr Evans, Mr Frame and Mr Hannaford. He submitted that such evidence did not exclude, as a reasonable possibility, the presence or involvement of a fifth person who had escaped apprehension altogether. 

101In oral submissions, counsel argued that it was significant, in circumstances where it was the Crown case that Hussein was wearing the camouflage trousers at the BP service station and at the time of the robbery of Mr Evans, that he was not dressed in that way when spoken to by police shortly after the offences were committed. Counsel also pointed out that there was no evidence of camouflage trousers being found, burned or otherwise, at the time of the search of Manly's vehicle or anywhere in the vicinity of the commission of the offences. 

102Finally, counsel made reference to the evidence given by Mr Evans that the person who had fired the gun had gone back into the truck when it was driven away. He pointed out that the Crown case was that it was Hussein who fired the gunshots, but that it was Barghachoun and Riley who had driven away in Mr Evans' truck. Counsel submitted that the evidence failed to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, a conclusion that the man wearing the camouflage pants and who had fired the shots had entered the truck and driven off. He submitted that in these circumstances, it was not open to the jury to convict Hussein on counts 7 and 8. 

The submissions on behalf of the Crown
103The Crown again commenced by emphasising the need to consider the evidence as a whole. It was submitted that there was no doubt that one of the persons at the BP Service Station was wearing camouflage pants and that there was equally no doubt that the man with the gun at the time of the robbery of Mr Evans was also wearing pants of that description. The Crown submitted that the fact that Hussein was not wearing that clothing when spoken to by the police was of no consequence in view of the fact that he had obviously had an opportunity to change his clothing. 

104The Crown expressly conceded in oral submissions that if it were accepted that the person who discharged the firearm had entered the truck, then that person could not be Hussein. However, the Crown submitted that the only available conclusion was that such an observation was simply wrong. 

105The Crown also conceded that there was no evidence that any person saw a man with camouflage pants get into the Mazda. However, the Crown submitted that this was a reasonable inference to draw, on the basis that there existed an opportunity for the person to have done so. 

Consideration and conclusion
106In my view, the submissions made by counsel for Hussein as to the lack of evidence to support count 4 must be accepted. The telephone evidence was capable of inferring that all four offenders travelled north from Sydney at or about the same time. However, what vehicle Hussein may have been travelling in at the time was a matter of conjecture. I am not persuaded that the only rational inference was that he was travelling in the Mazda. However, even if that conclusion were reached, a conclusion that he was responsible for the theft of the number plates is, in my view, based largely on conjecture. 

107In terms of counts 7 and 8, and as I have noted, the Crown case was that Hussein was responsible for discharging the firearm, but that Barghachoun and Riley were responsible for driving Mr Evans' truck away from the scene. There were four persons who gave evidence of seeing and/or hearing the gunshots, namely Mr Evans, Mr Frame, Mr Hannaford and Mrs Hannaford. However, only one of those persons, namely Mr Evans, gave evidence of seeing the gunman after the shots were fired. He said (as noted in [44] above) that the gunman got back into the truck, following which he (Mr Evans) heard it being driven away. It was no part of the Crown case that Hussein drove away in the truck. Significantly, the evidence of Mr Evans was the only evidence given as to the path taken by the gunman after the shots were fired.

108When this issue was raised in the course of the hearing before this Court, the Crown's response was to submit that the evidence of Mr Evans was ""wrong"". Such a response fails to address the issue. Given the case brought against Hussein, it was incumbent upon the Crown to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, that the gunman entered the truck. Far from excluding such a possibility, the evidence of Mr Evans, which was the only evidence on the issue, not only raised such a possibility it but squarely suggested that it had in fact occurred. No other evidence was adduced by the Crown to contradict the evidence of Mr Evans. Those circumstances, in my view, were fatal to the Crown's case against Hussein on counts 7 and 8. Further, and whilst it is not necessary for me to express a concluded view, such circumstances may lend some weight to the hypothesis advanced by counsel for Hussein that there was, in fact, a fifth person involved in the robbery who was not apprehended.

109Further, the Crown's position is not saved by the fact that the gunman was identified wearing camouflage pants. There was no evidence which supported the Crown case that the man wearing camouflage pants, who was the gunman, entered the Mazda vehicle. The fact that there was an opportunity to do so does not overcome the fact that on Mr Evans' evidence, the gunman entered, and left the scene in, another vehicle altogether. Moreover, and in any event, Hussein was not dressed in that way when spoken to by police a short time later and there was, as counsel pointed out, no evidence of a pair of camouflage pants having been disposed of or destroyed. 

110For these reasons, I am not satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of Hussein's commission of the offences in counts 4, 7 and 8. It follows that his appeal against those convictions must be upheld, and the convictions quashed. 

THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE OF HUSSEIN
The grounds of appeal
111Given the conclusions I have reached in relation to counts 4, 7 and 8, Hussein's application for leave to appeal against sentence is limited to the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9. Those sentences are set out in the table in [9] above and the overall sentence imposed is set out in [10].

112As I understood it, the Crown did not cavil with the proposition that if Hussein's appeal against conviction were upheld, it would necessarily follow that his criminality was lower, and that this would give rise to a necessity to re-sentence him on the remaining counts. 

The findings of the sentencing judge
113The principal findings of the sentencing judge in respect of Hussein's commission of the offences in counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 may be summarised as follows:

(i)Hussein was the offender who took the most active role in relation to the various robberies (at ROS [30]);
(ii)the fact that the offending in count 3 involved (inter alia) extensive planning and was committed in company rendered it ""significantly more serious"" than the circumstances discussed in R v Henry (1996) 46 NSWLR 346 (at ROS [34]);
(iii)the value of the damage resulting from the offending in count 9 must have been considerable, although the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the offender who actually lit the fire (at ROS [37]).

114Her Honour considered Hussein's subjective case. She noted (at ROS [38]) that he had a record for juvenile offending in respect of matters of a relatively minor nature. She made reference to his disturbed upbringing in Iraq (at ROS [40]) and his history of epilepsy (at ROS [42]).

115One of the significant aspects of Hussein's subjective case concerned his mental health. Tim Watson-Munro, a Clinical Psychologist, prepared a report of 11 December 2012 following his examination of Hussein on the same day. He noted a history of psychotic illness referable to a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia in 1998/1999. He also identified longstanding symptoms of anxiety, depression and low self esteem.

116In addition, a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, Psychiatrist, was before the sentencing judge. Dr Allnutt concluded that Hussein met the criteria for a diagnosis of chronic psychotic disorder, including paranoid schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, characterised by auditory hallucinations, referential ideas and mild paranoid ideation. Dr Allnutt also diagnosed a depressive disorder and a post traumatic stress disorder. Because Hussein maintained his innocence at the time of the examination, Dr Allnutt was unable to express an opinion with regard to any nexus between the documented symptoms and the offending. 

117The sentencing judge made reference to Hussein's depressive state (at ROS [45]) and to the fact that he had been diagnosed with a chronic psychotic disorder (at ROS [46]). Her Honour described Hussein's mental health and related matters as constituting ""strong subjective circumstances"". However, her Honour concluded (at ROS [47]) that those matters did not directly lessen Hussein's moral culpability or render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, although they did have the effect of making imprisonment more difficult. It is evident that such matters, in combination with others, formed the basis of her Honour's finding of special circumstances (at ROS [51]). 

Consideration and conclusion 
118It follows from the conclusions that I have reached that Hussein's overall criminality is less than that for which he was sentenced at first instance. Specifically, whilst he does not take issue with the jury's verdict of guilty in respect of count 6, he must now be sentenced on the basis that he was not responsible for the possession or discharge of a firearm in the course of that offending.

119I do not agree with the observation of the sentencing judge in respect of count 3 that the offending was ""significantly more serious"" than the circumstances discussed in Henry (supra). But for the value of what was taken, the features of the offending might be regarded as being similar in many respects. In particular, and whilst there was obviously some planning involved, the extent of it was largely unknown. 

120Further, her Honour appears to have accepted the evidence that Hussein was mentally ill but concluded that this did not render him an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. Her Honour did not express her reasons for reaching that conclusion. In my view, the conclusion reflects error. 

121The fact that there was no established nexus between Hussein's mental state and his offending did not, of itself, mean that such mental state was not relevant to the question of general deterrence. Whether it rendered Hussein an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence depended upon an assessment of the circumstances of the case (see Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235 at [27]-[30], citing R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194. Her Honour did not engage in such an assessment. 

122The mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to sentence (see De La Rosa (supra) at [178] per McClellan CJ at CL). In the present case, there was evidence that Hussein was suffering from more than one diagnosed psychiatric illness. Paranoid schizophrenia, which was one of the diagnoses reached by Dr Allnutt, is an obviously serious psychiatric illness. In Hussein's case, it was also one of long standing, and manifested itself in a number of different ways. In my view, all of these factors combine to render Hussein an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. 

THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE OF BARGHACHOUN
123Barghachoun seeks leave to appeal against the sentences which I have set out in the table at [13] above. His overall sentence is set out at [14].

The grounds of appeal
124The grounds of appeal advanced by Barghachoun are as follows:

(a)As to the sentences imposed for counts 1 and 2:
(i)the sentencing judge gave greater weight to the objective criminality than was warranted in the circumstances; and
(ii)the sentence imposed was disparate to that imposed upon Hussein.

(b)As to the sentence imposed for count 3:
(i)the sentence imposed failed to reflect the lesser role played by Barghachoun in the commission of the offence; and
(ii)the sentencing judge made findings of fact which were adverse to Barghachoun which were not open.

(c)As to the sentence imposed for count 6:
(i)the sentence imposed failed to reflect the lesser role played by Barghachoun in the commission of the offence;
(ii)the sentence imposed failed to reflect that the role played by Barghachoun in the commission of the offence was substantially similar to that played by Riley; and
(iii)the sentencing judge made findings of fact which were adverse to Barghachoun which were not open. 

(d)As to the overall sentence:

(i)the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the principle of totality.

125In respect of the sentence imposed for count 6, senior counsel abandoned an assertion which was originally pressed that the sentencing judge had erred by double counting the element of planning. 

The findings of the sentencing judge
126Her Honour reviewed (commencing at ROS [6]) the facts of the offending before turning to consider (commencing at ROS [15]) Barghachoun's background. Having noted his criminal history, her Honour rejected (at ROS [16]) a submission that there was a causal connection between Barghachoun's drug addiction and his offending, before finding (at ROS [17]) that there was some evidence that he was ""capable of remaining crime-free for an extended period"". 

127Her Honour then considered the nature of the offending. She found (at ROS [18]) that all offences committed by Barghachoun prior to the robbery of Mr Evans' truck were part of an overall plan and were not committed impulsively. She found that Barghachoun was ""very much involved in the planning"" and that he was a participant from the outset. 

128Her Honour then considered the individual offences and made the following findings: 

Counts 1 and 2

the offending was committed in company with Hussein and for that reason was potentially more frightening from the perspective of the victims (at ROS [19]).

Count 3

Barghachoun was not the principal offender and was guilty because he was part of a joint criminal enterprise (at ROS [20]);
although he was involved in the planning of the robbery it was ""probably very last minute planning"" necessitated by the ""failure"" of the offending in counts 1 and 2 (at ROS [20]);
he was present at the scene of the robbery, inferentially a matter of metres away from Hussein, and was available to assist Hussein (at ROS [20]).
Count 4

The offending was ""a relatively minor matter"" (at ROS [21]).

Count 6

the offending was an objectively serious armed robbery which was planned (at ROS [22]);
those involved were prepared to drive a considerable distance to rob the truck (at ROS [22]);
the offence was committed in company (at ROS [22]);
although Mr Evans suffered very serious emotional harm, the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that such emotional harm was significantly worse than would ordinarily be expected to stem from an offence of this nature (at ROS [23]);
other relevant aggravating features included the fact that the offence was committed in company, that Barghachoun was on bail at the time and that he had a history of serious offences of dishonesty (at ROS [24]);

Count 10

The offending was unplanned and opportunistic (at ROS [25]).

129Her Honour concluded (at ROS [26]) that in respect of the offending in counts 3 and 6 it was necessary to consider the guideline judgment in Henry. She found (at ROS [26]) that the offending in count 3 was more serious than was the case in Henry. She also found (at ROS [26]) that the offending in count 6 was ""much more serious"" than that in Henry. She then imposed (at ROS [27]) the sentences I have previously outlined.

The submissions on behalf of Barghachoun
130Senior counsel argued that the criminality exhibited by Barghachoun in the offending the subject of 1 and 2 was less than that of Hussein. This, it was submitted, was demonstrated by (inter alia) the following:

(i)although both wore hoods, Barghachoun did not cover his face with a scarf;
(ii)the acts of Barghachoun were limited to attending the service station, demanding the keys from Mr So, and being present as a support for Hussein.

131Senior counsel also pointed, in respect of counts 1 and 2, to the fact that (inter alia) no person was placed in danger by any act of Barghachoun and that the offences were of limited duration. Whilst acknowledging that the plan to use the stolen vehicle to drive to a crime scene necessarily elevated the level of criminality, senior counsel submitted that the sentence imposed was indicative of greater weight having been given to the objective criminality than was warranted. He also submitted that even allowing for the fact that Hussein's subjective case was stronger, the differences in objective criminality favoured Barghachoun and that there was an undue disparity in the sentences which were ultimately imposed.

132As to count 3, senior counsel submitted that Barghachoun's criminality was far less than that of Hussein, but that this was not reflected in the sentences which were imposed. It was further submitted that the offending should be viewed as opportunistic and impromptu. Senior counsel further submitted that Barghachoun's role was limited to one of being available to assist Hussein. 

133As to count 6, senior counsel pointed to the fact that by reference to sentencing statistics, the sentence imposed was at the high end of the range. He submitted that Barghachoun's role was substantially less than that of Hussein. It should be noted that senior counsel also submitted that Barghachoun's criminality in respect of count 6 should be regarded as being less than that of Hussein because of Hussein's possession and use of a firearm. In light of the conclusions I have reached in relation to counts 7 and 8 against Hussein, that submission is rendered nugatory. 

134Finally, senior counsel submitted that the overall sentence imposed failed to give proper weight to the principle of totality, and was manifestly excessive when consideration was given to Barghachoun's criminality. 

The submissions on behalf of the Crown
135The Crown submitted that there was little to distinguish the criminality of Barghachoun and Hussein with respect to the offending in counts 1 and 2. It was submitted that the differences in their methods of disguise were insignificant and that the more important consideration was that they had obviously agreed to steal a motor vehicle. It was submitted that in this respect, their criminality did not materially differ. The Crown also relied upon the CCTV footage of the offending in counts 1 and 2 which, it was submitted, supported the conclusion that Hussein was carrying a gun.

136In terms of Barghachoun's criminality in the offending in count 3, the Crown expressly acknowledged in written submissions (at [67]) that ""the seriousness of (Hussein's) involvement in count 3 was greater than (Barghachoun's)"". However, the Crown submitted that this was properly reflected in the sentences imposed, which took into account the various subjective circumstances of the respective offenders. 

137In respect of count 6, the Crown submitted that any reliance upon sentencing statistics was of limited utility. It was submitted that no error arose from her Honour's findings as to the level of planning and that this Court should be ""cautious"" before reaching a conclusion that Barghachoun had any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the sentence imposed on him when compared with that of Hussein. 

138In terms of the overall sentence imposed, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had a broad discretion when determining issues of concurrency and accumulation, and that the overriding principle was that the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of an offender's conduct. It was submitted that the sentence imposed achieved that objective and that it disclosed no error.

Consideration and conclusion 
139I am not able to accept the entirety of the submissions which were advanced by senior counsel in support of Barghachoun's position. In particular, I am not able to draw any real distinction between his offending and that of Hussein in respect of counts 1 and 2. The proposition that a distinction arises from a difference in their form of disguise relies upon a circumstance which, in terms of the overall offending, is of limited significance. 

140Similarly, I am not able to accept that reference to sentencing statistics demonstrates that the sentencing judge erred. This Court has said, on numerous occasions, that such statistics are of limited utility (see for example R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 153 at [117] per Kirby J). Consistency in sentencing is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence (see Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [48]-[49]; 535; Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [40]).

141However, the central proposition advanced by senior counsel was that when the offending was viewed both individually and overall, Barghachoun's criminality was less than that of Hussein and that this was not properly reflected in the overall sentences which were ultimately imposed. Whilst I am not able, for the reasons advanced, to distinguish between their criminality in respect of counts 1 and 2, there is merit in the submission advanced by senior counsel that when the sentences are viewed overall, the differences in criminality in some of the other offending has not been properly reflected. 

142In terms of count 3, Barghachoun's role was generally supportive of that of Hussein. The fact that Hussein's role was greater was acknowledged by the Crown. Similarly, in terms of count 6, Barghachoun's role was predominantly that of driving the truck away from the scene. He was not positively identified as performing any other function. 

143In KR v R [2012] NSWCCA 32 Latham J (with whom Whealy JA and Harrison J agreed) observed (commencing at [19]) that the participants in a joint criminal enterprise are equally responsible for all of the acts which were committed in the course of carrying out the enterprise, irrespective of by whom those acts were committed, and that a particular participant's level of culpability was to be assessed by reference to his or her particular conduct. Her Honour went on to observe (at [20]) that such an approach is consonant with the distinction in law between an offender's responsibility for criminal conduct and his or her culpability, before saying (at [21]):

""Criminal responsibility, and therefore liability to punishment, attaches to a person who voluntarily and intentionally performs those acts constituting the offence. 'The concurrence of will and physical act and the concurrence of intent and physical act suffices to attract criminal liability': R v O'Connor [1980] HCA 17 at [20]; 146 CLR 64 at 72 per Barwick CJ.

[22] Culpability, on the other hand, is concerned with the assessment of an offender's moral responsibility for the offence. As such, it assumes liability for the offence and focuses upon aspects of the offender's conduct and his/her subjective circumstances in order to determine the appropriate degree of punishment: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; R v Henry and Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [254]; 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149"".

144I am satisfied that Barghachoun's criminality was less than that of Hussein in an overall sense. That was not reflected in the sentences which were imposed and I am left to conclude that error has been established, and that lesser sentences are warranted in law. However in re-sentencing, two matters must be borne firmly in mind. The first is that Hussein's subjective case was much stronger than that of Barghachoun. In particular, Hussein was not on conditional liberty at the time and did not have a record for similar offending. The second is that as a consequence of the conclusions I have reached in relation to Hussein's appeal against conviction, the overall criminality for which he is to be sentenced is lessened. However, that of Barghachoun is not. It follows that resultant differential between the respective sentences that I propose will be narrower than might otherwise have been the case. 

145Finally, I note that following the conclusion of the hearing an affidavit sworn by Barghachoun on 1 April 2014 was received which the Court was asked to take into account, should it come to the question of resentencing. In that affidavit, Barghachoun details various courses he has undertaken since being in custody, including those directed at addressing gambling and substance abuse. He is presently employed as a wing sweeper and enjoys the support of his family. I have taken all of these matters into account in the orders that I propose.

146Finally, I note that the sentences that I propose for both Hussein and Barghachoun will give effect to the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge in each case.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2763745,Application by Ivan Robert Marko Milat pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2014] NSWSC 434,"decision
Introduction1Ivan Robert Marko Milat (the applicant) applies pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act) for an inquiry into his conviction on seven counts of murder and one count of detaining for advantage. 
The basis for the application2The applicant summarised the basis for his application in the following way:Unease at trial judge ruling of no burden of proof onus on Crown to provide its criminal enterprise evidence:(a) because the Crown did not prove the criminal enterprise evidence that the trial judge directed the jury to act on;(b) because the trial judge erred, the obligation was on the Crown to prove the evidence that is put to the jury as proof of guilt.
3The applicant referred to passages from the summing up in the course of which his Honour said:""... The issue is whether the Crown has also established that the accused is guilty of those murders - that is, that he was criminally responsible for the acts by which the seven victims were murdered.  . . .The Crown, of course, has made it abundantly clear that it does not know whether he acted alone or in company, so whenever I refer to a 'joint criminal enterprise' I mean either alone or in company. The word 'joint' is perhaps is a misleading one, so perhaps I should simply say that he participated in a criminal enterprise, either alone or with another or others.
It is for the Crown to persuade you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did participate in a criminal enterprise, either alone or in company, in relation to each of the murders.. . .The Crown's primary case is that one person, either alone or with another or others, was involved in the murder of all seven victims and that the accused was that person.""
4The applicant also referred to the description of the Crown's alternative case given by the trial judge in the summing up which would arise if the jury considered that the Crown had failed to eliminate doubt in relation to the applicant's evidence of an alibi for the murders of Anja Habschied and Gabor Neugebauer. His Honour said:""The Crown's alternative case excludes the possibility that there was just one person acting alone in the murder of all seven victims. The alternative case is that there was a small group consisting of at least two persons involved in the murders of these seven victims. It is unable to establish how many persons were in this group, or that its membership was constant or how many persons were involved in relation to each murder. Each person may have been involved in all seven or just some of the murders. The Crown says that there was nevertheless at least one person who, with another or others, was involved in the murder of the remaining five victims - Deborah Everist, James Gibson, Simone Schmidl, Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke -and that the accused was that person."" 
5Finally, the applicant relied on the following passage in the summing up regarding DNA analysis that indicated that hairs found in the hand of Joanne Walter did not belong to the applicant, or any other member of the Milat family:""This point was not explained, and you may wonder how it means that the accused was not involved in the murder of Joanne Walters. You may think that it means only that Joanne Walters had not been subdued by the accused, but that does not mean that he was not there subduing Caroline Clarke, or performing some other function in that criminal enterprise."" 
6In the context of these directions given to the jury in the summing up, the substance of the application appears to be that, in failing to prove the applicant's precise role in the murders (and, in particular, whether he committed them alone or as part of a joint criminal enterprise), the Crown had failed to discharge its burden of proof. The applicant's reliance on the DNA evidence appears to suggest that he was somehow deprived of the benefit of its exculpatory value.
Applicable law7 Part 7 of the Act relevantly provides:""78  Applications to Supreme Court(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence maybe made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or byanother person on behalf of the convicted person.(2) ...79 Consideration of applications(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:(a) it appears that the matter:
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are specialfacts or special circumstances that justify the taking offurther action.(3A)  ...(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings.However, the Supreme Court may consider any writtensubmissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.(5) ...""
7The principles applicable to the consideration of applications under s 79 were reviewed by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland under s.78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 (Holland):
""[6]The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].  
[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore [2000] NSWSC 364; (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19].
[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].
[9]The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convictedperson with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues havebeen exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Mi/at [2005]NSWSC 920; (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it anopportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with theultimate submission that acquittal should result.""
Factual background8The applicant was tried in the Supreme Court before Hunt CJ at CL and a jury from 25 March to 27 July 1996. On 27 July 1996 the applicant was sentenced for each of the seven offences of murder to penal servitude for life. For the offence of detaining for advantage he was sentenced to penal servitude for six years.  
9The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed his appeal against conviction on 26 February 1998: R v Milat [1998] NSWSC 795. Gleeson CJ (Meagher JA and Newman J agreeing) summarised the facts as follows:""Between December 1989 and April 1992, seven backpackers disappeared shortly after leaving Sydney, travelling south. They were Deborah Everist and James Gibson from Victoria, Simone Schmidl from Germany, Anja Habschied and Gabor Neugebauer also from Germany, and Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke from the United Kingdom. Their bodies were discovered in the Belanglo State Forest over a period between September 1992 and November 1993. The victims were all young, being aged between nineteen and twenty-two years. They were all travelling in circumstances where they were unlikely to have been missed for some time after they were killed. Each set out along the Hume Highway from near Liverpool in order to hitchhike south. All of the bodies were covered with branches and leaf litter and were in an advanced state of decomposition when found. Forensic evidence showed that each victim had been attacked savagely, with a great deal more force than was necessary to cause death, and apparently for some form of psychological gratification. Two of the victims had been shot a number of times in the head. One had been decapitated. Three others had stab wounds which would have caused paralysis, two of them having had their spinal cords completely severed. Two had been strangled. All but one appeared to have been the subject of sexual interference, either before or after death.
The backpacker who escaped was named Paul Onions. He was from the United Kingdom. He reported the incident to the police immediately after he escaped. He gave the police a description of his attacker. That was before any of the bodies had been discovered in the Belanglo State Forest. The incident was treated by police at the time as an offence involving an assault with a firearm. Later, after the bodies had been discovered and there had been international publicity about the backpacker murders, Mr Onions made contact with the police who were investigating the murders, and told them his story. He returned from England to Australia in 1994, and again in 1996 for the trial of the appellant, and was an important Crown witness.
When, following investigations, the police arrested the appellant in 1994, they found a great deal of property linking him directly to the backpacker murders. ... in the appellant's house, and in his mother's house (where the appellant had been living at the time of the murders), and also amongst some possessions of the appellant stored in the house of one of his brothers, the police found many articles of clothing, and items of equipment, which were shown to have belonged to the deceased backpackers. The police also found in the possession of the appellant an array of weaponry proved to have been connected with the murders. They found in his possession a bloodstained cord. DNA testing linked the blood to one of the victims. Ultimately, the evidence which connected these articles to the victims of the backpacker murders was so comprehensive, and so overwhelming in its force, that trial counsel for the appellant, in his concluding address, made an important tactical concession. He acknowledged that the Crown had proved that the murders had been committed by a person or persons belonging to, or very closely associated with, the Milat family. However, it was contended that it was not the appellant who had committed the murders but it was probably one or more of his brothers, such as Richard Milat or Walter Milat, acting alone or in company with others.  
The evidence of Paul Onions was powerful. ... The most important aspects of it were the physical description he gave of his attacker when he first reported the matter to the police, and an account he gave of information the attacker had given to him about his (the attacker's) personal background. As will appear, there were some aspects of the identification evidence of Mr Onions that were relied on by the defence, but the jury were entitled to regard the total effect of his evidence as strongly incriminating. Moreover, the man who attacked and, for a time, detained, Mr Onions, near the Belanglo State Forest, and who matched the appellant's description, had been left in possession of Mr Onions' rucksack after he fled. When the police arrested the appellant they found, amongst his clothing, at his mother's house, a distinctive shirt (referred to as the ""Next"" brand shirt) which belonged to Mr Onions and which had been amongst the items of clothing in his rucksack. This shirt was found next to a shirt belonging to the appellant.In his remarks on sentence the Chief Judge at Common Law said:The case against the prisoner at the conclusion of the evidence and the addresses was, in my view, an overwhelming one. Although his legal representatives displayed a tactical ability of a high order, and conducted his defence in a skilful and responsible manner, in my view the jury's verdicts were, in the end, inevitable, I agree entirely with those verdicts. Any other, in my view, would have flown in the face of reality'.
10The applicant's grounds of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal were, in substance, as follows:(1)The identification evidence (relevant to the charge of detaining for advantage) given by Mr Onions was received into evidence in error and ought to have been excluded as unreliable and unfair, and a related argument, not appearing in the grounds, that it was unfair and inappropriate for the trial judge to leave for the consideration of the jury the possibility that Mr Onions had been mistaken about the vertically mounted rear wheel on the Nissan vehicle.
(2)That the trial judge erred in a ruling as to the comment that was open in the event that the applicant decided to make an unsworn statement from the dock.
(3)That the trial judge, in his directions to the jury, failed to put the defence case fairly and made various observations which undermined or underestimated the strength of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant at trial.
(4)Photographic and other evidence which was inflammatory and prejudicial, and which served no forensic purpose ought not to have been admitted.
(5)A complaint of irregularities giving rise to a reasonable suspicion as to the fairness of the trial.
(6)That by reason of prejudicial publicity before and during the trial, the convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory and amounted a miscarriage of justice.  
11Gleeson CJ (with whom the other members of the Court of Criminal Appeal agreed) dismissed each ground of appeal and concluded by observing that he was satisfied that the applicant had a fair trial, according to law, and that the matters complained of produced no miscarriage of justice.  
12An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused in May 2004: Milat v The Queen [2004] HCATrans 179. In dismissing the application Gummow J said:
""There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. None of the matters now raised by the applicant demonstrates that it is arguable that there has been any miscarriage of justice in this matter..."".
Previous applications for review of conviction
13The applicant has made four applications to the Court for a review of his conviction, each of which has been declined.
The first application14The first application, which was made under the predecessor provision in Part 13A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), was dismissed by Barr J on 27 October 2005: R v Ivan Robert Marko Milat [2005] NSWSC 920. 
15The application principally concerned a segment of the identification evidence adduced at trial regarding the applicant's motor vehicle. The Court of Criminal Appeal had specifically considered this matter in connection with the first ground of appeal.  
16In dismissing the application for review, Barr J said:""26. The procedure under s474D Crimes Act is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted. Where the matter raised in such an application has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction, whether on appeal or otherwise, the Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the application: s474E(3). It seems to me that for the most part the matters raised in this application have been dealt with at trial and on appeal. However, since some arguments have been put in the application which may possibly be different from arguments put elsewhere, I have considered it. I have no unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand. No doubt or question about the guilt of the applicant arises on the material he relies on.""

Second application
17The second application for review of conviction was refused by McClellan CJ at CL on 14 December 2006: Milat [2006] NSWSC 1391. Each of the grounds of the second application involved evidence concerning Mr Onions and the applicant's motor vehicle. His Honour accepted the Crown's submission that each of the grounds raised in the application had been considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court. His Honour found that there was no basis for concluding that a doubt or question arose as to the applicant's guilt and confirmed that he had ""no unease and no sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand"".
Third application18The applicant's third application (which was considered under the present provisions of Part 7 of the Act) was dealt with and refused again by McClellan CJ at CL on 17 July 2008: Milat - Inquiry into conviction and sentence [2008] NSWSC 732. His Honour said:""4 In his submissions Mr Milat refers to a television program in which Mr Clive Small, a police officer apparently in charge of the investigations of Mr Milat's crimes, made comments about the matter. Mr Small allegedly said that there was no police evidence to suggest that Mr Milat acted with another person in committing the murders. The Crown prosecutor gave an interview on the same program. He apparently said that it was no part of the Crown case to prove that any person other than Mr Milat was involved in the murders.""
5 Mr Milat now complains that the trial judge's ruling that the Crown did not have to prove whether Mr Milat acted alone or in company was in some respects erroneous. His argument appears to be that because the Crown could not prove whether or not another person or persons was involved its case was flawed and he should not have been convicted.
6 In my opinion this submission is without merit. As I understand the Crown case it only sought to prove that Mr Milat committed the crimes. It was no part of the Crown case that others may have been involved. That case was made good and when I previously reviewed the matter I was satisfied, as was Justice Barr that it was a strong Crown case. It must be remembered that the matter was the subject of appeals including an application to the High Court.""
19The applicant sought special leave to appeal to the High Court from his Honour's determination. Heydon and Bell JJ found that the application for special leave was misconceived in that the refusal of McClellan CJ at CL of the application under s 79 of the Act was not a judgment from which an appeal could be brought to the High Court.
Fourth application20The fourth application was dated 15 May 2010. The applicant submitted that the Court should have ""unease over the reliability of the Crown's primary evidence"". Under this heading, the applicant referred to passages in the trial judge's summing up to the effect that the Crown had not sought to prove that only one person, acting alone, committed all seven murders, but that the Crown case was that the accused may alternatively have been involved in a joint criminal enterprise by which he was responsible for the murders.  
21The applicant submitted:""despite the verbal directions given by the Crown and trial judge of the facts of the Crown case no evidence was adduced linking the Petitioner in a [joint] criminal enterprise and or participation with another person or persons and no attempt made by the Crown to establish that one person [the applicant] alone committed any one, some or all of the murders"".
22The fourth application also relied upon what was said to be ""new evidence"". The complaint appeared to be that, at trial, the jury were neither required nor directed to make any finding whether the Crown had established any of its ""primary facts"" as described, specifically that ""another person or other persons were involved in the murders"". The issue was then ""developed"", to found a submission that McClellan CJ at CL, in his determination given in 2008, had made an assessment to the effect that no evidence was available that could point to the existence of other person or persons involved in the murders.  
23The third ground for this application was that the DNA did not implicate the applicant and that he had also adduced cogent evidence of alibi.  
24The applicant complained there was no direction to the jury that the DNA evidence did not implicate him. He argued that because the vaginal swabs taken from Ms Clarke and Ms Walters had multiple contaminations, the only finding available to the jury was that the DNA evidence did not implicate Mr Milat.  
25The fourth application was refused by McClellan CJ at CL on 11 November 2010: Milat - Application for Inquiry into Conviction and Sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2010] NSWSC 1292. In doing so his Honour said:
""6 The present application is the fourth occasion on which Mr Milat has sought to have his conviction reviewed. I have considered that application and am satisfied that the matters raised by Mr Milat have been fully dealt with either in the proceedings giving rise to his conviction, the appeal or in the previous applications for review. I am not satisfied that there are special facts or circumstances that justify the taking of further action. For those reasons I refuse to consider or deal with Mr Milat's application.""
The present application26In my view, the present application involves a misapprehension of the Crown27case at trial which was that the applicant was criminally responsible for all seven murders even though the Crown did not contend that it could establish whether the applicant acted alone in carrying out the murders or whether more than one person was involved. 
28This matter was specifically addressed by Gleeson CJ in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the following terms:
""Before going to the grounds of appeal it is convenient to state, in a summary form, the Crown case, and the nature of the evidence upon which it was based. In this respect, it is to be noted that it was made clear, from the outset, that it was never the Crown's contention that it could establish that the appellant acted alone in carrying out these murders. Bearing in mind that some of the victims were travelling in pairs, and having regard to the way in which they appeared to have been bound or otherwise restrained, it was possible that more than one person had been involved in the murders. Furthermore, because there was an alibi raised in relation to the deaths of two of the victims, there was an alternative Crown case, the detail of which does not presently require consideration, based upon the possibility that such an alibi might have been found to be plausible. This is not a subject which is taken up by any of the grounds of appeal.""
29For reasons referred to above, the applicant's contention that the Crown did not discharge its burden of proof appears to rest entirely upon the erroneous proposition that the Crown had an obligation to prove the precise nature of his involvement in the murders and, in particular, whether he acted alone or as part of a joint criminal enterprise.  
30I do not regard the applicant's contention as capable of creating any sense of unease in allowing the convictions to stand. It does not provide any basis for raising a ""doubt or question"" as to his guilt.  
31There is, in my view, no substance to the applicant's contention that he was deprived of the benefit of the exculpatory value of DNA evidence in relation to the hairs found in Joanne Walters' hand. In the summing up the trial judge reminded the jury that an expert forensic biologist had excluded the hairs as belonging to any member of the Milat family, and the jury was properly directed as to the significance that it could attach to this evidence.  
32I do not consider this issue to be capable of raising any sense of unease in allowing the convictions to stand.  
33In any case, the present application raises no new fact or circumstance to justify action under Part 7. The applicant has sought to use s 78 of the Act as another avenue of appeal (see Holland (supra) and the authorities there cited by Johnson J, including the determination of Barr J in relation to the applicant's first application).   
34The present application substantially replicates the substance of the third and fourth applications, which McClellan CJ at CL considered and rejected.  
35Section 79(3) of the Act relevantly provides that the Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application for review of a conviction if ""it appears the matter has been previously dealt with under [Part 7]..."" and ""the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action"". 
36The matter has been previously dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the High Court and in previous applications made under Part 7 of the Act. I am not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. Accordingly I refuse to consider or otherwise deal with this application for review pursuant to s. 79(3) of the Act.

2763746,Clavel v Savage (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 463,"Judgment

 

1HIS HONOUR: On 14 June 2013, the Court, as presently constituted, issued judgment (""the earlier judgment"", Clavel v Savage [2013] NSWSC 775) in this matter and set a timetable for further submissions relating to liability and quantum against the first and second defendants based upon the findings of fact in the foregoing judgment and in relation to costs for the entire proceedings.

 

2Due to the issues associated with the unavailability of legal representatives for the first and second plaintiffs the timetable was not the subject of adherence and was altered on a number of occasions.

 

3Notwithstanding the continuing unavailability of the instructing solicitor for the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs filed a submission dealing with these issues on 14 November 2013 and the first and second defendants filed a submission in reply on or about 6 and 9 December 2013 respectively. The third defendant's application in relation to costs was, in accordance with the timetable, made on or about 10 July 2013. The matter was listed for hearing in relation to the remaining issues on 13 December 2013. Despite the disadvantage to which the plaintiffs referred in dealing with evidence relating to costs, the plaintiffs did not seek for the matter to be further adjourned and the disadvantage was more theoretical than apparent, given the Court's acceptance of statements from the bar table relating to issues in dispute. As a consequence, the Court will deal with the matter on the basis of the acceptance of those statements from the bar table and the submissions made in writing and orally.

 

Case Against the First and Second Defendants

 

4At [866] of the earlier judgment and following, the nature of the claim against Mr and Mrs Savage and the manner that it was pleaded was addressed. The cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage was confined to intentional infliction of emotional distress. There was no cause of action against either of Mr or Mrs Savage in assault or battery, nuisance or trespass.

 

5At one stage it was suggested that the reference at [79] of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim to the acts of Mr and Mrs Savage in paragraphs [2]-[13] was ""a typographical error"". I do not accept the error was ""typographical"".

 

6Nevertheless, as submitted correctly, the proceedings were conducted on the basis that the allegations of fact at [66]-[78] were the basis for the cause of action, the intention for which is pleaded at [79] and the damages from which are pleaded at [80] and [81]. I will consider the cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage on that basis.

 

7I reiterate that the only cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage is a cause of action based upon the tort described in Wilkinson v Downton [1987] 2 QB 57. I have already stated that there is no claim against Mr or Mrs Savage in assault or battery; nor is there a claim in nuisance or trespass (except to the extent that Wilkinson v Downton is a trespass on the person).

 

8The only ""wrongful"" conduct found against Mr and Mrs Savage (and for these purposes I do not differentiate between the first and second defendants) was described in the earlier judgment. The term ""wrongful"" was used in order to signify that no finding was being made that the conduct was tortious or gave rise to a cause of action. I found that:

 

(i)Mr Savage caused stones to be thrown onto the roof of Mr and Mrs Clavel's home in or about October 1999 (earlier judgment at [894]);

 

(ii)A laser beam was shone into the lounge room or home of Mr and Mrs Clavel by Mr Savage on or about 25 February 2000 (earlier judgment at [903]);

 

(iii)On or about 14 January 2000, Mr Savage yelled abuse to Mr Clavel including that he was ""a sick man"" and enquiring as to whether or not he had taken his medications (earlier judgment at [907]);

 

(iv)On or about 16 January 2000, Mrs Savage, in response to suggestive conduct by Mr Clavel accused Mr Clavel, of having a sexual problem and of being a paranoid psychotic (earlier judgment at [899] and [905]).

 

9The issue arises as to whether that conduct is, or any of it, the basis for a cause of action as alleged.

 

10I deal first with the incident of 16 January 2000. Before doing so, it is necessary to restate the conclusions as to the elements of the tort on which the plaintiffs rely.

 

11In the earlier judgment at [36] I upheld the view that there is currently in Australia a tort of intentional infliction of harm, including psychiatric injury, the elements of which are:

 

(i)A deliberate act (hereinafter, ""the conduct"") by the putative tortfeasors;

 

(ii)An intention (including reckless indifference) to cause physical or psychiatric harm by the conduct;

 

(iii)The occasioning of harm (including psychiatric injury, but not mere distress) as a result of the conduct;

 

(iv)The harm being caused to a person to whom harm is intended (or a person in the immediate vicinity to whose harm the perpetrator is recklessly indifferent);

 

(v)In circumstances where the conduct was reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person;

 

(vi)The putative tortfeasor has engaged in the conduct without justification or lawful excuse.

 

12Dealing then with the events of 16 January 2000, the Court, in the earlier judgment, held that the conduct was confined to the exchange of abuse between Mrs Savage and Mr Clavel. The Court accepted the version of events recounted by Mrs Savage. In other words, the conduct about which complaint is made is in the following context.

 

13Mrs Savage was hanging out washing. Mr Clavel made a suggestive motion (undoing his zipper), which ceased with the arrival of another. In response to the suggestive motion with his zipper and hand, Mrs Savage referred to Mr Clavel as a paranoid psychotic and to him having a sexual problem. The Court does not accept that, on that day, Mrs Savage made any other comment of any relevance.

 

14The Court concludes that Mrs Savage's conduct was a reaction to the conduct of Mr Clavel. In those circumstances, and leaving aside any other element of the tort, the Court does not find that Mrs Savage's conduct was other than a reaction to the conduct of Mr Clavel, and in particular, was not performed with an intention to cause physical or psychiatric harm, nor a reckless indifference to the causing of physical or psychiatric harm.

 

15While I will deal with the matter more fully in relation to the other conduct about which complaint is made, which analysis applies with greater force to the events, as I find them, on 16 January 2000, I also do not consider that this event, of itself, or in combination with other events, occasioned harm of the kind that is necessary, as discussed in the earlier judgment. Nor do I consider that the conduct in question was reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person.

 

16Moreover, given the provocative conduct of Mr Clavel, to which this was a reaction, it is not at all clear that the conduct of Mrs Savage, in relation to this particular incident, was without justification or lawful excuse.

 

17As a consequence, the events that, in my finding, occurred on 16 January 2000, do not give rise to a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress as that tort was described in the earlier judgment.

 

18That which remains to be considered is the following conduct of Mr Savage: throwing stones onto the roof of Mr and Mrs Clavel's home in or about October 1999 (earlier judgment [894]); the exchange of abuse between him and Mr Clavel on or about 14 January 2000 (earlier judgment [899]-[900]); and the laser beam incident of 25 February 2000 (earlier judgment [901] and following).

 

19The plaintiffs urged the Court to consider that conduct in context of the other events that were occurring at Mackerel Beach. The difficulty with such a course is that most of the other events about which the plaintiffs complain are not events the responsibility of which can be sheeted home to Mr or Mrs Savage. Further, most of them are matters about which there is no complaint on the pleadings (assuming, in that remark, that the pleadings claim damage from Mr and Mrs Savage beyond that which is contained in paragraphs 2 to 13 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim).

 

20In the case of Mr Savage there are three episodes of conduct that I have found ""wrongful"": the throwing of stones onto the roof; the exchange of abuse; and the shining of a red laser beam into Mr and Mrs Clavel's house. It is necessary to deal with each of them individually and together, bearing in mind, also, the submission that each incident should be seen in the context of more general behaviour.

 

21The elements of the Wilkinson v Downton tort make clear that it is not intended to arise from the exchange of abuse between persons. While such statements are deliberate acts they are not statements that would generally meet the criteria that the conduct would be reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person.

 

22As I have determined in the earlier judgment, Mr Clavel ""gave as good as he got"". There was an exchange of abuse, Mr Savage yelled abusive language, including that Mr Clavel was ""a sick man"" and enquiring whether he had taken his medication.

 

23The pleading, necessarily, does not plead evidence; it pleads only fact. Nevertheless, the facts as found are that Mr Clavel also yelled abuse in what was an exchange between two adults. Other than the fact that Mr Savage's comments were deliberate, I am not satisfied of any other element, in relation to this incident, that would satisfy the elements that give rise to the cause of action under Wilkinson v Downton.

 

24I deal next with the incident associated with throwing stones on the roof of the Clavels. Plainly, such conduct is a trespass. Mr Clavel does not sue in trespass. Nor does Mrs Clavel. Further, such conduct is plainly childish and discloses a significant immaturity of approach by Mr Savage. Does it also satisfy the elements for a claim in damages under intentional infliction of emotional distress?

 

25Again, the throwing of the stones was a deliberate act, and therefore satisfies the first element. Further, the sixth element (as recited by me at [36] of the earlier judgment), which requires that the conduct be engaged in without justification or lawful excuse, is also satisfied.

 

26The plaintiff has the onus of proof, as stated in the earlier judgment, and I am not satisfied on the evidence adduced in the proceedings that, to the extent Mr or Mrs Clavel suffer a psychiatric injury, and not mere distress, it is as a result of stones being thrown on the roof.

 

27Even ignoring, for present purposes, the effect on the mental state of Mr Clavel of the childhood traumas suffered by him, it is unlikely that the stones on the roof, of themselves, would cause a psychiatric injury of the kind suggested. That is also true, leaving aside the reference to childhood trauma, of Mrs Clavel. Moreover, it is not conduct that would be reasonably likely to cause that kind of harm in a normal person. Nor do I consider that harm was in fact caused by this particular conduct, at least of itself. Further, even with other events, this conduct was not a substantial contributing factor to any injury.

 

28Lastly, on the evidence before the Court, I cannot conclude that there was an intention (including reckless indifference) to cause physical or psychiatric harm (of the kind to which reference has been made).

 

29The shining of the laser beam into Mr and Mrs Clavel's house is conduct of a more serious kind than the other incidents that I have already dealt with in this judgment. The incident itself was described by each of Mr Clavel, Mrs Clavel and their son Benjamin Clavel and the accounts of the incident are contained in the earlier judgment.

 

30Essentially, Mr Savage shone a laser pointer into the lounge area of Mr and Mrs Clavel. It displayed a red light on the ceiling and occasionally on the wall and also, at one point, onto Ms Poulton's face. Ms Poulton, as is recited in the earlier judgment, was a visitor in the home of Mr and Mrs Clavel. As a consequence of the red beam, each of the persons present in the home crouched low. At one point there was a suggestion by Benjamin Clavel that it was possible the laser beam might be attached to the end of a gun.

 

31At the time that statement was made, namely 25 January 2000, Benjamin Clavel was unaware that Mr Savage owned a gun. Nevertheless, Mr Clavel was aware of it. Mr Savage had told him some years before. In fact, Mr Savage did not have a gun. The person who owned a gun to which Mr Savage may have had access had left Mackerel Beach some years before the incident in question. It is not clear whether Mr Clavel was aware of those latter circumstances.

 

32As already found in the earlier judgment, I accept that Mr and Mrs Clavel were distressed by the shining of the laser beam. That finding is made on the balance of probabilities. The conduct was deliberate, it had no justification or lawful excuse, but the other elements are more difficult to identify and satisfy. If harm were caused, I accept that it was caused to Mr and/or Mrs Clavel in circumstances where, if it were intended, it was intended against each of them.

 

33I am, on the balance of probabilities, prepared to draw the inference that the act of shining the laser beam was intended to cause distress and was likely to cause distress in a normal person. Leaving aside for present purposes, the absence of proof that satisfies the Court of psychiatric injury of the kind required in order to successfully obtain damages under the Wilkinson v Downton tort, I do not consider that the shining of the laser beam was reasonably likely to cause psychiatric harm of the kind necessary in a normal person, nor occasioned the psychiatric harm in Mr or Mrs Clavel. Further, I do not consider that Mr or Mrs Clavel have proved, even on the balance of probabilities, that the intention (or reckless indifference) of Mr Savage was to cause psychiatric harm of that kind.

 

34As I concluded in the earlier judgment, I do not consider that the evidence of the experts establishes psychiatric harm caused by these incidents at Mackerel Beach, because, at least in relation to Mr Clavel, the opinion that Mr Clavel suffers a form of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the events at Mackerel Beach is predicated on the absence of childhood trauma that may have caused such an affect.

 

35Nevertheless, leaving aside the childhood trauma, there are so many incidents of which Mr and Mrs Clavel complain, none of which are actionable or relied upon for the purpose of causing damage, yet would have cumulatively been far more likely to cause any psychiatric damage that has been occasioned. Moreover, the number and quality of the incidents, and the matters in complaint, particularly those against the police, relating to the note about the Corsican Liberation Army, the reaction to the explosion and the incident at the Pollack residence are such that the laser beam incident cannot be seen as a substantial cause or aggravating feature of any psychiatric damage that may have been inflicted.

 

36In relation to Mrs Clavel, the ""events"" at Mackerel Beach were a contributing factor to her depression, or the redevelopment of some. As described in the report of Dr Westmore of 25 November 2008, it is the aggregation of all of the events that has been the factor. Moreover, the evidence (and the report) discloses that her predominant fear and anxiety arose from her and her husband's treatment at Mackerel and by the police.

 

37I am not satisfied that the laser beam incident on 25 January 2000 was a substantial cause of, or contributing factor to, the depression.

 

38I have taken into account in examining these ""wrongful"" events, the other activities at Mackerel and the context in which they have occurred. On the one hand, that context is available in order to draw an inference as to the purpose of the conduct of Mr and Mrs Savage. It also makes Mr and Mrs Clavel more vulnerable to damage.

 

39On the other hand, the events at Mackerel for which neither Mr nor Mrs Savage are responsible are, on the evidence, the overwhelming cause of any damage that may have ensued. If there were damage, it has occurred as a result of the other conduct and not any of these events.

 

40I make it clear that if I could draw the inference that it was more probable that any conduct of Mr or Mrs Savage caused the injuries suffered, I would have so held. Intention, as I've tried to explain, merely involves deliberate conduct for which psychiatric injury was a natural or probable consequence (Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377; (2007) 71 NSWLR 471 at [82] per Spigelman CJ).

 

41As earlier explained, if psychiatric damage were suffered by Mr or Mrs Clavel, it was occasioned by events at Mackerel for which neither Mr or Mrs Savage can be held responsible.

 

42In those circumstances, the claim against the first and second defendants must fail.

 

 

Costs 

 

43The first and second defendants make no application for any special order for costs. An ordinary costs order will be made. The third defendant refers to two ""offers of compromise"" on which it bases an application for a special costs order.

 

44On 18 October 2010, the Crown solicitor by letter offered a compromise on the following terms:

 

(1)""Verdict and judgment for the third defendant;

 

(2)Each party bear its own cost in the proceeding;

 

(3)This offer shall be open until 25 October 2010 at 9am;

 

(4)This offer is made in accordance with r 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).""

 

45As it is clear, from the foregoing the offer remained open for one week only and essentially required the plaintiff to discontinue or accept judgment against themselves in relation to the third defendant and otherwise bear their own costs.

 

46At the time that the offer of compromise, referred to above, was made the costs and disbursements of the third defendant on a party/party basis were approximately $350,000.00 to $400,000.00.

 

47The third defendant submits that, as a consequence, the offer of compromise of 18 October 2010 was properly characterised as an offer of compromise with a real element of compromise contained in it. Plainly, the plaintiffs have achieved less than that which the third defendant offered.

 

48The alternative submission made by the third defendant relates to two letters sent or dated 22 December 2010, sent to the solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Clavel and offering, in relation to the first such letter, a verdict for Mr Clavel for $175,000.00 plus costs of $300,000.00 including GST, and, in relation to the second letter, a verdict for the second plaintiff of $25,000.00 and costs of $100,000.00. In aggregate, the third defendant was offering $200,000.00 plus $4000,00.00 in costs (inclusive of GST).

 

49The letters of 22 December 2010 were not offers of compromise under the rules, but specifically referred to the principles enunciated in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 and other cases adopting those principles.

 

50Given the nature of the proceedings and the allegations that were made, and the level of preparation that had occurred, notwithstanding that the formal Offer of Compromise of 18 October 2010 complied with the UCPR provisions, I do not consider that it had a sufficient level of compromise to render its non-acceptance unreasonable.

 

51In some senses, the later Calderbank letter of 22 December 2010 discloses that the conduct of the plaintiffs in refusing the offer made on 18 October 2010 was most reasonable. I do not consider that a different costs order based upon the offer of compromise of 18 October 2010 should be made.

 

52The Calderbank offer of 22 December 2010 is in a different category. Of course, it is not a formal Offer of Compromise. Nevertheless, it is an offer made without prejudice except as to costs. It was more than reasonable in the circumstances. It was expressly open for 28 days, being a reasonable period, and would have achieved for the plaintiffs a result that was more favourable than that achieved in the litigation.

 

53As a consequence, I will order indemnity costs on and from 22 December 2010. There is one qualification that is required.

 

54While no reference has been made to it, the third defendant applied by motion for the admission of certain evidence under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995. Notice under s 67 was given.

 

55The Court appointed an independent expert to report and some significant costs were expended on dealing with the notice. The notice was withdrawn. The evidence was not adduced. The plaintiffs' costs of that exercise ought to be paid by the third defendant. I allow approximately 5 days' costs for that exercise (out of approximately 52 hearing days) and reduce the costs payable by 20% (i.e. 10% less days plus 10% to be paid to the plaintiffs).

 

56The Court makes the following orders:

 

(1) Judgment for the first and second defendants.

 

(2) The plaintiff shall pay the first and second defendants' costs of and incidental to the proceedings.

 

(3) The plaintiff shall pay 80% of the third defendant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings on a party/party basis up to and including 22 December 2010 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.

 

(4) Proceedings otherwise dismissed.

2763748,"Western Freight Management Pty Ltd v Roads and Maritime Services, New South Wales [2014] NSWCA 132","Judgment
1McCOLL JA:  Western Freight Management Pty Limited, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Davies J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Western Freight Management Pty Ltd v Roads and Maritime Services, New South Wales [2013] NSWSC 1123; (2013) 64 MVR 415) upholding the decision of Magistrate Ryan given at Katoomba Local Court on 18 December 2012 which found the applicant guilty of a contravention of s 56(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) (the ""RTG Act""). 
2This is the concurrent hearing of the applicant's application for leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, the hearing of its appeal against the primary judge's decision.
3Leave to appeal is required because the appeal from the Local Court decision was made pursuant to s 52, Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW): s 101(2)(h) Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Section 52 limits an appeal to a ""ground that involves a question of law alone"". 
4For the reasons that follow, I would refuse the application for leave to appeal.
Factual Background
5Pursuant to s 56 of the RTG Act an operator of a vehicle or combination is guilty of an offence if a breach of a mass, dimension or load restraint requirement occurs.  If the breach concerned is a substantial risk breach or a severe risk breach of a mass requirement, the operator has the benefit of a reasonable steps defence: s 56(3), RTG Act.  That defence appears in s 87 of the RTG Act to which I refer below.  (The RTG Act was re-named the Road Transport (Vehicle and Driver Management) Act 2005 (NSW) on 1 July 2013 which, in turn, was repealed on 10 February 2014, but nothing turns on that.)6The applicant was issued with a Penalty Notice on or about 21 March 2012 for an offence described as ""[o]perator - substantial risk breach mass axle requirement"": s 56(1), RTG Act.  The Penalty Notice alleged that at 3:30am on 15 March 2012 the applicant was the operator of a vehicle consisting of a prime mover tabletop and trailer driven on the Great Western Highway, when the load on ""axle group 3"" (hereinafter referred to as the ""tri-axle"") of the vehicle (22.68 tonnes), exceeded the weight allowed (20 tonnes), by an amount of 2.68 tonnes. The overload of 2.68 tonnes was an overload percentage of 13.40%, which, it is uncontroversial, constituted a substantial risk breach of the mass requirement.  The applicant indicated by completing a part of the Penalty Notice form that it elected to have the matter determined by a court.
7On 28 June 2012 the respondent served a Court Attendance Notice (""CAN"") on the applicant alleging a breach of s 56(1) of the RTG Act in substantially the same terms as those in the Penalty Notice.  In essence, as the Magistrate who heard the matter explained in her judgment, the breach alleged was that rear axles four, five and six of the vehicle were over-loaded.
8The applicant admitted the axles were overloaded as alleged in the CAN, but sought to invoke the reasonable steps defence afforded by s 87 which provides:
87 Reasonable steps defence for mass requirements: drivers, operators and owners (1) If a provision of this Act, or a regulation made under this Act, states that a person has the benefit of the reasonable steps defence for an offence relating to a mass requirement, it is a defence to a prosecution for an offence alleged to have been committed by a person as the driver, owner or operator of a vehicle or combination if the defendant establishes that the defendant:(a) did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, of the contravention, and 
(b) had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention. 
(2) If the relevant contravention resulted from the fact that the mass of the vehicle or part of the vehicle (together with the mass of any load on the vehicle or part of the vehicle) exceeded any limit prescribed by the regulations, then the court is not entitled to be satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention unless it is satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to cause the mass of the load carried on the vehicle to be ascertained at the start of the journey during which the contravention occurred. 
(3) The court is not entitled to be satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to cause the mass of a load to be ascertained unless it is satisfied that:(a) the load had been weighed, or 
(b) the defendant, or the driver of the vehicle, was in possession of sufficient and reliable evidence from which that weight was calculated. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the defendant satisfies the court that at all material times that the defendant did not, either personally or through any agent or employee, have custody or control of the vehicle concerned. (5) If the defendant is a corporation, then, in order to satisfy the court that the corporation did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known of the relevant contravention, the corporation must satisfy the court that:(a) no director of the corporation, and (b) no person having management functions in the corporation in relation to activities in connection with which the contravention occurred, knew of the contravention or could reasonably be expected to have known of it. 
9Magistrate Ryan heard the matter in Katoomba Local Court in November 2012 and delivered her decision finding the applicant guilty as charged on 18 December 2012.  Her Honour held that the applicant had not established it had taken reasonable steps to prevent the contravention because the driver of the vehicle had not checked the truck once it was loaded to ensure the load had been correctly distributed in the manner in which the loader had been instructed.10The respondent accepts that the applicant established before her Honour that no director or person having relevant management functions knew, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, of the contravention: s 87(1)(a).  The Magistrate found that the applicant failed to establish that it did not have custody or control of the vehicle at all material times (s 87(4)).  The applicant does not seek to challenge that ruling.
11The Magistrate's critical reasons for the finding that the respondent had failed to establish its reasonable steps defence emerge from the following passages of her Honour's reasons.  Her Honour explained the circumstances in which the tri-axle came to be overloaded as follows:
""[T]he defendant company picked up goods from another company, called Minova Pty Ltd, pursuant to a transport contract the defendant had with Newcrest Mining Limited. 
The driver of the truck, Mr Alan Eggleton, is a truck driver of twenty-five years experience.  He gave evidence of the process involved in loading the truck by forklift operated by an employee of Minova.  That, I might add, is at the site of the Minova Company in Blacktown.  Mr Eggleton instructed the forklift operator to distribute the load in a certain configuration which was given to him by WFM administration.  Mr Eggleton instructed the forklift operator to load ten packs of dome plates on the goose neck. 
The configuration of the load was not carried out according to instructions given by Mr Eggleton, for reasons unknown.  Mr Eggleton was the driver, was in the driver safety zone whilst the loading was being carried out.  This is a requirement of the firm called Minova, that the drivers, whilst the loading is being undertaken, move to an area to ensure their own safety.  The driver safety zone is about thirty metres from the loading area. Mr Eggleton stated that they were 'Really hurrying you along because of double parking.  They just push us through.  It was rushed.'
...
""When asked what he would do if he had any indication that it [the loading] was not done properly he said: 'I would have requested him to do it again.'  In his evidence-in-chief Mr Eggleton stated, 'I knew it was correct, if they misloaded, I would have told them to load it again.' He also stated that he had seen it done before.
The chief executive officer of WFM, Brandon Kidner, gave evidence.  Key to his evidence on the issue he stated in his evidence that, 'We would call if it is not loaded to the driver's request.'  In exhibit 10 Minova Australia Chain of Supply Core Procedure 5.2.2 states that:
'It will be the responsibility of Minova Australia forklift operator as well as the driver of the outbound vehicle concerned to ensure that loads are within the axle and mass weight limits.'
He also stated that, 'Once the trucks leave Minova no further checks are conducted.'  He agreed that under the chain of responsibility it is the driver's responsibility as per the practice and procedure to ensure that weight management is complied with.  He agreed that Alan Eggleton had signed up on the practice and procedure."" 
12The Magistrate found:
""It is clear to me from the evidence of Eggleton and Kidner that the driver has the power to request that a truck be reloaded if the driver saw that it was being loaded incorrectly.  WFM's practice and procedure manual clearly states the following - and this is highlighted, in capital letters, and underlined in the practice and procedure: 'You are the driver, axle weights are your responsibility.' ...It is up to the defendant to take all reasonable steps to ascertain the mass of the load over the various axles. The fact that the driver did not adequately check the load prior to driving out of Minova is, in my view, extremely poor practice. The final responsibility of compliance rests with the driver.  How can compliance be met if the driver does not check visually the load? ... The driver acknowledged that if he noticed that the load was not correct then he would tell them to load it again.
This gives rise to my belief that the driver had the ability to check the load but chose not to due to various possible reasons, primarily, it seems, including the fact that Minova were rushing trucks through as they were double parked outside. ... The key issue is axle overloading.  All parties are aware of it as being significant in compliance with the Act.  The driver said he would not allow it to happen.  The driver never checked the truck once it was loaded.
The fact is that the driver failed to take reasonable steps to meet a most common sense approach. If he had made certain observations on the day and made a complaint then there is no doubt that this would have been considered as taking a reasonable step, but he did not even make the observation. He relied on the so-called professionalism of the forklift operator [the person he instructed to load the truck in a particular manner]."" 

13The applicant relied upon four grounds of appeal before Davies J (primary judgment at [8]) which can be described as the Kirk point (Kirk v Industrial Court (NSW) [2010] HCA 1; (2010) 239 CLR 531), a complaint about an alleged under-declaration of weight by the consignor of the load, an irrelevant consideration complaint that the Magistrate referred to the fact that since the contravention the applicant has weighed its trailers on a weighbridge following loading and a complaint about penalty.  
14The Kirk point was a complaint that the Magistrate ""erred in law by finding that the prosecutor had no obligation to particularise within the statement of charge, or in advance of the hearing, the steps it asserted in submissions were reasonable for Western Freight Management Pty Ltd to take to avoid the relevant acts or overload"": primary judgment (at [8](1)).  The primary judge rejected that ground of appeal, concluding (at [16]) that the relevant provisions of the RTG Act were sufficiently different from the provisions of the legislation considered in Kirk to make that case distinguishable.  
15The applicant seeks to agitate the correctness of the primary judge's decision on the Kirk point if granted leave to appeal, albeit that its draft ground of appeal is slightly differently expressed from that before the primary judge, seeking to contend that:
""To the extent that the prosecution was entitled to suggest a different regime for meeting the defendant's obligations under the Act, the defendant ought to have been put on notice of it before the matter went to trial.""
16The applicant seeks to argue that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to indicate prior to trial who it alleged failed to take a step which was reasonably available, and what that step might be, in order that the applicant be able to defend itself. That argument is, in my view, misconceived. 17No ingredient of the s 56 offence concerned taking steps to prevent the contravention.  Rather, the actus reus of the s 56 contravention was the overloading, in this case of the tri-axle, not any matter which went to requiring the applicant to take reasonable steps.  That was the subject of its s 87 defence.  As the primary judge said (at [16]), once the s 56 contravention was particularised in the Penalty Notice and the Court Attendance Notice, the applicant knew the charge it had to meet: see also Kirk (at [26]).  
18The position was otherwise in Kirk.  The vice of the charge in that case was the failure to particularise the actus reus of the offence, which failure prevented the defendant from relying upon a statutory defence which depended upon it establishing it was not reasonably practicable for the person to comply with the provision of this Act or the regulations the breach of which constituted the offence: Kirk (at [27] - [28]).
19The applicant did not otherwise seek to agitate any of the other grounds of appeal relied upon before the primary judge.  However it sought to argue that it was not open to the Magistrate to find it liable on the basis of the driver's failure to inspect the load contending that on the proper interpretation of the RTG Act, in particular s 87, it could not be found liable for any act or omission other than that of its directors and managers.  It sought to rely in this respect on R v Nelson Group Services (Maintenance) Ltd [1998] 4 All ER 331; [1999] 1 WLR 1526.  In that case the English Court of Appeal held that on the proper construction of the relevant legislation, it was not necessary for the adequate protection of the public that the employer should be held criminally liable for an employee's negligent act, as those employees were themselves liable to criminal sanctions thereunder.
20This argument was not raised before the Magistrate.  Indeed, before the Magistrate, the applicant's written submissions sought to rely upon the driver's conduct, as well as that of its management, to discharge its burden of establishing its reasonable steps defence.  Nor as will be apparent from the foregoing was this argument relied upon before the primary judge.  The applicant did not contend otherwise, nor did it seek to persuade the court that exceptional circumstances warranted granting it leave to raise the point for the first time on appeal: cf Gipp v R [1998] HCA 21; (1998) 194 CLR 106 (at [62] - [65]) per McHugh and Hayne JJ; (at [138]) per Kirby J; Crampton v R [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 (at [12] - [20]) per Gleeson CJ; (at [47] - [50]) per Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ; (at [122]) per Kirby J and Fingleton v R [2005] HCA 34; (2005) 227 CLR 166 (at [6]) per Gleeson CJ; (at [62]) per McHugh J; (at [144] - [145]) per Kirby J; (at [195]) per Hayne J; Gordian Runoff Ltd v Westport Insurance Corporation [2010] NSWCA 57; (2010) 267 ALR 74 (at [237]) Allsop P (Spigelman CJ and Macfarlan JA agreeing).  It is not, accordingly, a question which can be raised in this Court.
21As I have said, it is apparent from the applicant's written submissions before the Magistrate that its case that it took all reasonable steps for the purposes of s 87(1)(b) was advanced in reliance on conduct which included that of the driver, as well as asserting that the failure properly to load the vehicle was an act committed while the vehicle was not in its custody or control.  As I have also said, it lost the latter point and has not challenged that ruling.  
22Otherwise, the applicant sought to establish its reasonable steps defence before the Magistrate by adducing evidence concerning the system it had established to seek to ensure that no overloading occurred.  That system, as is apparent from the evidence her Honour recited (see [11] above), included ensuring, if the vehicle was not loaded correctly, that it was reloaded.  On the occasion the contravention occurred the driver did not inspect the load to ensure it was correctly distributed and, accordingly, did not require those loading it to correct their error: see primary judgment (at [33]).  23It was clearly open to the Magistrate given the manner in which the applicant presented its case before her Honour to conclude that it had failed to establish its s 87 reasonable steps defence.  That conclusion was a finding of fact which raises no question of law susceptible to appellate review.
24I would dismiss the application for leave to appeal with costs.
25BASTEN JA:  The applicant was, on 15 March 2012, the operator of a commercial vehicle with multiple axles.  On 18 December 2012 it was convicted in the Local Court at Katoomba for breaching the weight limit for the rear axle on the Great Western Highway near Blackheath.  The offence arose under s 56 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Road Transport Act""), as then in force.  Because of the degree of the overload, the breach was characterised as a ""substantial risk breach"" for the purposes of s 56(3).  Pursuant to that provision, the applicant had the benefit of ""the reasonable steps defence"", as identified in s 87 of the Road Transport Act.  The applicant did not dispute the elements of the offence, but sought to rely upon the defence under s 87.  The magistrate rejected the defence, convicted the applicant and imposed a fine of $3,000 and costs totalling $3,383.
26The applicant appealed (as of right) on four grounds that were said to involve questions of law alone, pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Davies J, in the Common Law Division, dismissed the appeal on 30 August 2013: Western Freight Management Pty Ltd v Roads and Maritime Services, New South Wales [2013] NSWSC 1123.  The applicant sought leave to appeal from that judgment.
27Although four grounds were relied upon before Davies J, the applicant accepted (with one qualification, which will be addressed below) that only one of the grounds was reflected in the grounds contained in the draft notice of appeal in this Court.
28As will be explained below, the qualification was misconceived and the single common ground had no reasonable prospects of success.  Those conclusions would warrant refusal of leave to appeal.  Nor should leave be granted to allow an appeal on grounds which were not agitated in the Court below, but could have been, had they merited attention.  As will be explained, they did not raise any arguable question of law arising from the judgment of the Local Court.
Judgment of magistrate29The offence was originally identified when the applicant's vehicle was weighed at the Mount Boyce weighing station on the Great Western Highway, west of Blackheath.  A penalty notice was issued, but the applicant elected to go to trial in order to run a defence that it had taken ""all reasonable steps"" to prevent the contravention.
30The offence was detected in the early hours of the morning of 15 March 2012.  On the previous day, a driver employed by the applicant had taken the vehicle to the premises of a supplier known as Minova Australia to be loaded with a number of metal plates to be transported to Cadia East at Orange.  The driver had given specific instructions to the Minova forklift operator as to how the load was to be distributed on the trailer.  The offence occurred because the forklift driver did not comply with those instructions.  The issue identified by Magistrate Ryan in the Local Court was whether the applicant had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
31The driver of the vehicle was required to remain in a specified ""driver safety zone"" whilst the loading was being carried out.  Nevertheless, in the course of the loading, he returned to the vehicle to put the gates on the truck.  He said he did not watch the forklift operator to confirm he was carrying out his instructions because he (the driver) ""assumed he [the forklift operator] was doing his job properly.""  He also agreed that he did not check that the pallets had been placed in the right positions after the loading had been completed.  The magistrate stated in the key passages in her reasons at p 3:
""The fact that the driver did not adequately check the load prior to driving out of Minova is, in my view, extremely poor practice.  The final responsibility of compliance rests with the driver.  How can compliance be met if the driver does not check visually the load?
The driver stated throughout his evidence that he relied on the professionalism of the forklift operator to load the truck in accordance with his instructions.  ...  The driver acknowledged that if he noticed that the load was not correct then he would tell them to load it again.
This gives rise to my belief that the driver had the ability to check the load but chose not to due to various possible reasons ....  The driver never checked the truck once it was loaded.
The fact is that the driver failed to take reasonable steps to meet a most common sense approach.  If he had made certain observations on the day and made a complaint then there is no doubt that this would have been considered as taking a reasonable step, but he did not even make the observation.""
Statutory scheme32To understand the statutory context in which these findings of fact were made and to understand the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to refer to the terms of s 87, which prescribes the available defence.
87 Reasonable steps defence for mass requirements: drivers, operators and owners (cf Roads Act 1993, s 235)
(1) If a provision of this Act... states that a person has the benefit of the reasonable steps defence for an offence relating to a mass requirement, it is a defence to a prosecution for an offence alleged to have been committed by a person as the driver, owner or operator of a vehicle or combination if the defendant establishes that the defendant:
(a) did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, of the contravention, and(b) had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention.
(2) If the relevant contravention resulted from the fact that the mass of the vehicle or part of the vehicle (together with the mass of any load on the vehicle or part of the vehicle) exceeded any limit prescribed by the regulations, then the court is not entitled to be satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention unless it is satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to cause the mass of the load carried on the vehicle to be ascertained at the start of the journey during which the contravention occurred.
(3) The court is not entitled to be satisfied that the defendant took all reasonable steps to cause the mass of a load to be ascertained unless it is satisfied that:
(a) the load had been weighed, or(b) the defendant, or the driver of the vehicle, was in possession of sufficient and reliable evidence from which that weight was calculated.
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the defendant satisfies the court that at all material times that the defendant did not, either personally or through any agent or employee, have custody or control of the vehicle concerned.
(5) If the defendant is a corporation, then, in order to satisfy the court that the corporation did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known of the relevant contravention, the corporation must satisfy the court that:
(a) no director of the corporation, and(b) no person having management functions in the corporation in relation to activities in connection with which the contravention occurred,
knew of the contravention or could reasonably be expected to have known of it.
33While the provision is carefully structured, its application is not without its difficulties, although they were not difficulties which were the focus of attention in the Local Court.  That is in part because the provision covers a range of offences.  It was not in doubt that the offence committed under s 56 was an offence ""relating to a mass requirement"" for the purposes of s 87(1).  However, the term ""mass requirement"" was defined for the purposes of Ch 3 of the Road Transport Act to include a requirement of an applicable road law concerning mass limits relating to the mass of the vehicle excluding a load, the mass of the unladen vehicle together with the load, and the mass on an axle, amongst other categories: s 20.
34Subsections (2) and (3) of s 87 required that the defendant took all reasonable steps ""to cause the mass of the load carried on the vehicle to be ascertained at the start of the journey"": subs (2).  The temporal element was not in dispute: the parties agreed that the journey began when the laden vehicle left Minova's premises.  It is clear that these provisions would not have applied to an offence relating to the tare mass of a vehicle (that is unladen).  What is less clear is whether the requirement that the load be weighed or that there be sufficient and reliable evidence from which that weight was calculated, applied only to the total mass of the load, or could apply to the mass on the rear axle, which was the particular breach in the present case.
35Ultimately, nothing turned on this uncertainty because Magistrate Ryan did not determine the case on the basis of satisfaction of subss (2) and (3).  Nor was that course necessary.  Those provisions constituted limitations on the availability of the defence: satisfaction of those provisions was a necessary but not sufficient element of the defence.
36As appeared from the submissions made in the Local Court, the applicant was undoubtedly concerned about the operation of those limitation (or gateway) provisions because it sought to argue that, during the loading process, it did not either personally or through its driver, have custody or control of the vehicle.  That submission sought to engage the exclusion of subss (2) and (3) provided by subs (4).  Because the magistrate did not rely upon a failure to comply with subss (2) and (3), she did not address subs (4) (although the argument that ""at all material times"" the applicant did not have custody or control of the vehicle must have been doomed to fail).
37There might also have been a further issue as to whether the applicant did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known of the contravention, for the purposes of subs (1)(a).  To that end the applicant, being a corporation, was required to satisfy the court that no director and no person having ""management functions in the corporation in relation to activities in connection with which the contravention occurred"" knew of or could reasonably be expected to have known of the contravention: subs (5).  The sole director of the applicant gave evidence that he did not know and a finding that he could not reasonably be expected to have known could reasonably have been made.  Such a conclusion might not have been reached in respect of the driver, and there might have been a live issue as to whether he was a person having relevant management functions in relation to the driving of the truck, in circumstances where he had been responsible for the loading.  (He was not the driver at the time or place at which the offence occurred.)
38However, a careful reading of the magistrate's reasons indicates that she did not determine the case on that basis.  In stating the issue and in reasoning to a finding that the offence was proven, the sole focus of the reasons was subs (1)(b).  It appears to have been assumed that the defendant could not establish that it had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention if there were steps open to the driver responsible for supervising the loading of the vehicle which were reasonable and were not taken by him.  That understanding would be consistent with the terms of subs (4), which envisaged the possibility that a commercial owner or operator might have custody and control of the vehicle through an employee or agent.
39In these circumstances, the primary issue resolved against the applicant was one of fact, which could not be challenged on an appeal under s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
Appeal to Supreme Court40This Court was not provided with the summons by which the appeal was brought to the Common Law Division.  However, counsel for the applicant agreed that the only grounds of appeal were those set out by Davies J at [8] in the following terms:
""In those circumstances the grounds of appeal are these:
(1) The learned Magistrate erred in law by finding that the prosecutor had no obligation to particularise within the statement of charge, or in advance of the hearing, the steps it asserted in submissions were reasonable for Western Freight Management Pty Ltd to take to avoid the relevant acts or overload.
(2) The learned Magistrate erred in law by failing to take into account a relevant matter (the under-declaration of the pallet weights on transport documents by a third party) in determining that the driver would be able to, by more thorough checking, determine that the trailer had not been loaded in such a way as to be relevantly overloaded.
(3) The learned Magistrate erred in law by taking into account an irrelevant consideration, namely that the Appellant Western Freight Management now weighs trailers on a weighbridge following loading but after the vehicle is operating on a road or road related area, in forming the view that the Appellant had not taken all reasonable steps to prevent a mass related offence.
(4) The learned Magistrate erred in imposing a penalty significantly higher than that for which Western Freight was liable under the Penalty Notice, given the nature of the Defence, without providing reasons.""
41If the grounds were not limited to pure questions of law, the scope of the appeal might have been expanded, with leave.  Arguably they were not so limited, but no leave was sought and no leave was deemed necessary by the primary judge.
42The applicant accepted that the appeal to this Court did not raise any of the grounds set out as (2), (3) and (4).  On that view, the only ground in which the applicant persisted in this Court was ground (1).  The qualification to that conclusion was defensive, based on a concern that the primary judge had made a finding that the applicant could not satisfy the requirement of s 87(3)(b).
43That concern was unwarranted for three reasons.  First, as already noted, the magistrate did not determine the case on the basis of that provision: as a finding with respect to that provision was not necessary in order to dismiss the defence, her approach could not have been impugned as legally erroneous.  Secondly, it was not so impugned: the grounds of appeal before the primary judge did not raise that as an issue.  Thirdly, if, which is by no means clear, the primary judge did purport to make a finding of fact, he exceeded the scope of his jurisdiction on the appeal.
Failure to particularise flaw in defence44The remaining ground, which was raised before the magistrate and before the primary judge and persisted with in this Court was the first ground identified by the primary judge.  The matter was somewhat differently stated in the draft notice of appeal, the following terms being adopted:
""(2) To the extent that the prosecution was entitled to suggest a different regime for meeting the defendant's obligations under the Act, the defendant ought to have been put on notice of it before the matter went to trial.""
45That issue was raised before the magistrate: she concluded that there was ""no obligation imposed on [the prosecutor] to provide a list of all reasonable steps that a defendant in a particular case could have taken.  The [prosecutor] submits that this is nonsensical, and I agree that it would be almost impossible, given the myriad of steps that could be invoked.""  Both in the Local Court, before the primary judge and in this Court, the applicant sought in varying degrees to brings its case within the analysis adopted by the High Court in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 in relation to contravention of obligations imposed on employers by ss 15 and 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW).  Section 15 contained the following provisions:
15 Employers to ensure health, safety and welfare of their employees
(1) Every employer shall ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employer's employees.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an employer contravenes that subsection if the employer fails:
(a) to provide or maintain plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health,(b) to make arrangements for ensuring safety and absence of risks to health in connection with the use, handling, storage or transport of plant and substances ....
46As the High Court noted in Kirk, s 15(2) identified a non-exclusive list of the kinds of measures which the employer might need to take with respect to identifiable risks to health and safety.  The Court held that an adequate statement of an offence ""must identify the act or omission said to constitute a contravention of s 15 or s 16"": at [14].  The Act provided a defence where the defendant proved that ""it was not reasonably practicable"" to comply with the provision of the Act, the breach of which constituted the offence: s 53.  As the Court noted, ""[s]uch a defence can only address particular measures identified as necessary to have been taken in the statement of offence"": at [16].
47The applicant sought to rely on this reasoning to impose an obligation on the prosecutor in the present case to identify, prior to trial, those steps which should reasonably have been taken but which it was alleged had not been taken.
48In this regard, Kirk broke no new ground: it was merely an application of an established principle to a grossly inadequate pleading.  The principle is that a statement of an offence must identify ""the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence"": Kirk at [26], quoting John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42; 163 CLR 508 at 520.  The statement of the statutory offence did not require the incorporation into the offence of any relevant element of the defence.  The significance of the reference to the defence was that, unless the putative offender were told what conduct constituted the offence, albeit the conduct was by way of omission, the defendant would not be in a position to say whether there was a reasonably practicable course for remedying the alleged omission.
49The present statutory scheme differs in material respects.  The essential factual ingredients of the offence were not only specified, but were conceded.
50No doubt procedural fairness requires that various steps will need to take place before such a defence can be rejected.  Thus, on the evidence presented by the defendant, the critical error occurred when the truck was being loaded at the Minova premises.  The error could have occurred in one of a number of circumstances, including the failure of the driver to give the forklift operator correct instructions as to how to load the vehicle.  That did not occur.  According to the unchallenged evidence of the driver, the error was that of the forklift operator.  It was also accepted by the applicant that the error was not detected.  At that point, both prosecutor and defendant were aware of the precise nature of the defence.  At that point, procedural fairness may have required the prosecutor to identify a reasonable step not taken, namely visual inspection of the load.  That was done whilst the driver was giving evidence: he conceded that he had not undertaken a visual inspection of the load but had relied upon the forklift operator to carry out his instructions carefully (or as the driver put it, ""professionally"").  
51In order to submit that that involved a failure to take a reasonable step, it was necessary to explore whether there was any impediment to such a visual inspection.  The reason for the omission was indeed explored by counsel for the applicant in his examination in chief of the driver.  It was also explored in cross-examination.  The issues were clearly identified at that stage and neither party could complain of procedural unfairness when the magistrate determined the case by reference to that quite limited factual situation.  All of that goes beyond what is necessary to dispose of the present application.  It illustrates, however, why the essential ground of the proposed appeal could not have complained of procedural unfairness in the conduct of the trial.  Further, it illustrates why the actual complaint, namely that the prosecutor did not state the inadequacy of the defence prior to trial, was an absurd proposition.  As counsel for the respondent correctly noted, prior to trial, the respondent did not know what evidence the applicant would call by way of defence.  Just as procedural fairness does not require one party to take a step which would disclose nothing material to the other party, nor does it require a party to disclose its response to an unknown defence.  As explained by Gleeson CJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at [37]:
""Fairness is not an abstract concept.  It is essentially practical.  Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice.""
52The applicant's case is far removed from such considerations.  Indeed it turns the reasoning in Kirk on its head, imposing on the prosecutor the problem faced by the defendant in Kirk: that is, the difficulty of responding in ignorance of the case to be met.
Conclusion53The applicant has struggled to find a question of law erroneously determined by the magistrate.  The applicant's defence was disposed of on the solitary ground that the magistrate was not satisfied that it had taken ""all reasonable steps"" to prevent the contravention occurring.  That was an essential element of the defence.  It was a pure question of fact.  It was addressed and determined in entirely conventional terms.
54An appeal limited to a pure question of law was dismissed by the primary judge.  On the sole ground raised before him and pursued in this Court, his conclusion was entirely sound.  Although, in submissions in reply before this Court counsel for the applicant distanced himself from the direct application of the principles relied on in Kirk, that case was correctly distinguished by the magistrate and by the primary judge: no other relevant principles were relied upon.
55In these circumstances, there is no merit in granting leave to appeal.  The application should be dismissed with costs.
56LEEMING JA:  I agree with the reasons given by Basten JA, and with his Honour's conclusion that leave should be refused.  Section 87 caused confusion when the application was heard, for which reason I wish to add the following by way of elaboration.
57It was at all times common ground that the applicant could seek to avail itself of the benefit of ""the reasonable steps defence"" created by s 87 of the Act.  Section 87(1) makes it plain that the onus falls on the defendant (""if the defendant establishes that..."") to establish two things.  There was no dispute that the subjective and objective lack of knowledge required by s 87(1)(a) was satisfied.  However, the Magistrate found that the s 87(1)(b) requirement to have ""taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention"" had not been established, and accordingly convicted the applicant.  
58Subsections 87(2) and (3) are directed to courts, and restrict the ways in which the s 87(1)(b) defence may be established.  Subsection 87(2)  precludes a court from being satisfied that the all reasonable steps defence has been established unless that was done ""at the start of the journey"".  Subsection 87(3) precludes the court from being able to be satisfied unless either s 87(3)(a) or (b) is made out.  From those restrictions s 87(4) carves out an exception.  The applicant sought at trial to bring itself within that exception, but failed and did not reagitate that issue on appeal, and so subsection (4) can be put to one side.  It is true that, save where subsection (4) applies, subsections 87(2) and (3) are necessary gateways through which a defendant seeking to establish the all reasonable steps defence must pass.  However, it is not necessary, in order to reject the defence, to address the matters arising in s 87(2) and (3).  In short, subsections (2) and (3) are necessary, but not sufficient, requirements of a successful defence to the charge.  
59In the present case, the Magistrate was satisfied that the defendant had failed to establish that it had ""taken all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention"".  That being the only defence raised, the defendant was convicted.  Some of the submissions advanced in this Court failed to recognise that (a) the finding on s87(2) was a finding of fact, outside the scope of appeal to this Court, and (b) the finding on s 87(2) was sufficient to convict the applicant, without any occasion to consider subsections (3) and (4). 
60The applicant maintained that the Act required the prosecutor to specify the steps which were reasonable and had not been taken.  It is not necessary in order to reject that submission to say anything about whether, during the course of the trial, it may become necessary for a prosecutor to identify how it is said that the defendant has failed to take all reasonable steps.  It is not necessary to do so because the only point raised by the draft notice of appeal was error in failing to find that the prosecutor did not have an obligation ""to particularise within the statement of charge, or in advance of the hearing"" the steps asserted to have been reasonable which were not taken.  That could only be so if an element of the offence was that the absence of those steps was an element of the offence.  Indeed, that was what was submitted before the Magistrate.  It was said that the offence ""was, properly expressed, that it did not take all reasonable steps to prevent the axle overload"" (written submissions in reply, para 10(g)).  But that is not how the offence is defined by the Act.  Were that not so, the Crown would not have been able to close its case upon the tender of two certificates, on page 2 of the transcript of 21 November 2012.
61Accordingly, although the applicant invoked Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77; (1937) 59 CLR 467, questions of duplicity do not arise.  Instead, to the extent there is an obligation upon a prosecutor to specify steps which were reasonable and which had not been taken, it is to be seen not as an element of the offence created by the Act, but as an incident of natural justice in a particular case, in the manner to which Basten JA has referred.  
62The principal case sought to be advanced on appeal was that it was wrong to rely upon what the driver had or had not done in determining whether the applicant had made out the offence.  However, this was not raised before the Magistrate.  There is ordinarily no error of law in failing to address an argument that has not been made:  Commissioner of Taxation v Glennan [1999] FCA 297; 90 FCR 538; Skalkos v T & S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 321; 141 FCR 107 at [29]; Pham v NRMA Insurance Ltd [2014] NSWCA 22 at [33]; Haddad v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2014] NSWCA 23 at [30].
63To the contrary, the applicant positively asserted at the trial that the driver was not in a position where he could supervise the loading of the truck, nor could he determine whether the forklift driver had actually loaded the load where he said he was going to:  T21.18 and 39.  The Magistrate's finding, contrary to those assertions, that the driver had not adequately checked the load prior to driving out for which reason the applicant had not taken all reasonable steps was a finding of fact, outside the scope of the appeal created by s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  And it was a finding of fact which reflected the stance adopted before the Magistrate, inconsistent with the submissions sought to be advanced on appeal.
