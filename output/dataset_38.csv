on
appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

    Criminal
law -- Appeals -- Error of law at trial -- Provision for upholding of
conviction if no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice ‑‑ Appellants
convicted of charges arising out of a robbery and a break and enter -- Error
with respect to admission of evidence as to identity of accused ‑‑ Remaining
evidence circumstantial -- Convictions upheld on appeal ‑‑ Whether
or not Court of Appeal erred in upholding convictions -- Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

 

    The
accused were alleged to have been involved in the robbery of one drugstore and
the break‑in of another.  Both were convicted of armed robbery, of use of
a firearm in the commission of that robbery, of break and enter, and, in
Rawlinson's case, of possession of stolen property.  Leaney appealed all of his
convictions and Rawlinson all except the break and enter which he had admitted
committing.  A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of both on
all counts.  The issue before this Court was whether the Court of Appeal
had correctly applied s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  when it decided that, notwithstanding a finding of
error of law, the verdict would necessarily have been the same absent error of
law.

 

    The
break and enter was recorded on videotape.  At trial, four police officers, who
were unacquainted with the accused, and a police sergeant, who had been
acquainted with Leaney, identified Leaney as one of the persons shown on the
videotape.  The second person was not identified but matched the description of
Rawlinson.  The evidence of the police officers was admitted without a voir dire and
that of the police sergeant was fully cross‑examined.  The trial judge
viewed the videotape and concluded independently of the police officers'
testimony that Leaney was one of the persons shown on it.

 

    The
identification evidence of the break and enter was admitted as similar fact
evidence in the robbery charge against Leaney.  The only other admissible
evidence linking Leaney to the robbery and the firearms offence was
circumstantial:  boxes found hours after the robbery just outside Rawlinson's
apartment with Leaney's finger and palm prints on them, a general description
of Leaney matching one of the two persons involved in the robbery and Leaney's
association with Rawlinson who matched the description of the other person
involved in the robbery.

 

    Rawlinson
was not positively identified in the robbery.  The circumstantial evidence
linking Leaney to the crime, however, also linked Rawlinson.  In addition,
drugs had been found in a bag in his anal cavity, some of the kind stolen in
the robbery and some not, and a witness, following his instructions, recovered
a sawed‑off rifle which was similar to the weapon used in the robbery by
the person fitting his description.  Finally, Rawlinson declined to testify
despite the incriminating circumstances.

 

    Held:  The
appeal of Frank Earl Leaney from convictions for robbery and for use of
firearms in the commission of an offence should be allowed.

 

    Held (Wilson
J. dissenting):  The appeal of Frank Earl Leaney from the conviction for break
and enter should be dismissed.

 

    Held (Lamer
and Wilson JJ. dissenting):  The appeal of Henry Hugh Rawlinson should be
dismissed.

 

    Per
McLachlin, Sopinka and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ.:  Two fundamental errors occurred at
trial:  (1) when the trial judge treated evidence of the break‑in as
similar fact evidence going to the identification of the accused on the charges
arising out of the robbery and, (2) when the evidence of the police officers as
to the identity of the persons shown on the videotape was admitted.

 

    The
Court of Appeal properly applied s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
in upholding Leaney's conviction for the break‑in because no reasonable
jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could fail to convict on the
admissible evidence presented on the break‑in.  Since the trial judge
arrived at his conclusion as to identity independently of the evidence of the
police officers, their evidence assumed the character of mere surplusage and
its being inadmissible did not impair his independent conclusion.  No
appearance unfairness could be said to arise here, nor was there a miscarriage
of justice.

 

    The
Court of Appeal erred in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
to the charges against Leaney arising out of the robbery for a reasonable jury
could acquit on the evidence.  The trial judge's conclusions as to identity in
the break‑in could not be admitted as similar fact evidence in the
charges relating to the robbery.

 

    The
trial judge erred in using evidence on the break‑in trial as similar fact
evidence on the robbery and firearms charges against Rawlinson.  The Court
of Appeal, however, correctly concluded that no reasonable jury, properly
instructed and acting judicially, could fail to convict on the admissible
evidence on the robbery and firearms charges and properly applied
s. 613(1) (b)(iii).  The admissible evidence against Rawlinson was
impressive and the court could take into account his failure to explain
evidence connecting him to the crime.

 

    Per Lamer
J. (dissenting with respect to the appeal of Henry Hugh Rawlinson):  The
application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) to a given
set of facts in a case involves a question of law.

 

    A
new trial should have been ordered because the evidence against Leaney on the
robbery and on the firearms charges was such that a reasonable jury could
convict and yet the conclusion could not be made that no reasonable jury could
acquit.

 

    The
evidence adduced against Rawlinson on the robbery and firearms charges did not
meet the test of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) and a new
trial should be ordered.  It was evidence upon which a verdict of guilt could
rest comfortably and stand well beyond the reach of a court of appeal's
determination that it was unreasonable and could not be supported by the
evidence.  Much more, however, was required under s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

    The
trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the five police officers in
Leaney's trial for break and enter.  The testimony of four of the officers was
inadmissible and that of the police sergeant should first have been considered
on a voir dire.  The proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
was nevertheless properly operative as regards admission of the police
sergeant's testimony.  He had been fully cross‑examined and the matter
was not raised on appeal or through affidavit evidence alleging the his defence
had been prejudiced by the omission.  The fact that the trial judge arrived at
his own conclusion as to Leaney's identity, quite independently of the police
officers' testimony, did not result in or appear to result in a substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice.

 

    Per Wilson
J. (dissenting with respect to the appeal of Henry Hugh Rawlinson and with
respect to the appeal of Frank Earl Leaney from the conviction for break and
enter):  The convictions of Leaney and Rawlinson relating to the robbery and
firearms offences could not stand and a new trial should be ordered for the
reasons given by Lamer J.  A new trial, too, should be ordered for Leaney on
the break and enter conviction.

 

    A
""substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" sufficient to preclude
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) can occur when an appearance of unfairness is
created by the judge's error of law.  An appearance of unfairness was created
when the trial judge admitted the evidence of the police officers and
buttressed his own conclusions with it.  The evidence of four of the officers
was clearly inadmissible and that of the police sergeant, even if admissible,
could not be separated from that of the other officers because the overall
appearance was still one of unfairness.  A voir dire should
have been held to determine the admissibility of the police sergeant's
testimony.  The appearance of unfairness could only be dispelled if no reliance
were placed on the trial judge's reasons regarding the identification of the
man in the videotape.  Since the admissible evidence against Leaney, apart from
the videotape evidence, was inadequate to compel the conclusion that a properly
instructed trier of fact would necessarily have convicted him of the break and
enter charge, s. 613(1) (b)(iii) should not
be applied.

//Lamer J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    LAMER J.
(dissenting in part) -- The two accused were convicted by a Provincial Court
judge, sitting in Edmonton, Alberta, of armed robbery, break and enter, use of
a firearm in the commission of an offence and, in Rawlinson's case, possession
of stolen property.  Rawlinson appealed below (and in this Court) all of his
convictions except the break and enter and possession convictions which are not
before us; Leaney appeals all of his convictions.

 

    By a
majority the Court of Appeal of Alberta [(1987), 55 Alta. L.R. (2d) 362]
dismissed the appeals of both on all counts.  Harradence J.A. would have
granted the appellant Rawlinson a new trial on the robbery and firearms
charges, but dismissed his appeal on the charge of possession of stolen
property; he would have granted a new trial to the appellant Leaney on the
charge of break and enter, and a new trial with regard to the robbery and
firearm charges.

 

    As
Harradence J.A.'s dissent was one on a question of law, the two accused came to
this Court as of right.  The only question of law upon which Harradence J.A.
dissented in both appeals was whether these were proper cases for the
application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970,  c.  C-34.  There does not appear to be any disagreement below as to
what is the proper test to be applied under s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
which is now well known and which was set out in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739, per Cartwright J. at p. 744:

 

. . .
once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus
resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.  The
satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the
Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all.  The Court is not
bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

 

and per Spence
J., at p. 755, quoting Brooks v. The King, [1927] S.C.R.
633, as follows:

 

. . . this Court must apply the test set out in the aforesaid
cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The King:

 

    The
onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the  jury, charged as it
should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find
the appellant guilty.

 

and
then, further on, at p. 756:

 

If there
is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly charged, would have a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then this Court should not
apply the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) to affirm a
conviction.

 

    The
Crown argues that, the Court of Appeal having applied the right test, the
issues raised by the appellants before this Court relate to the applicability
of this test to the evidence before the learned trial judge, and that, as such
an exercise requires a reconsideration of the evidence, there is not raised a
question of law alone.

 

    This
Court has decided that the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
to a given set of facts in a case involves a question of law (see Mahoney v.
The Queen, [1982] S.C.R. 834).  This, in my view, disposes of the
Crown's preliminary objection.  This case does not raise the issue where the
difference of result is due to a disagreement on the facts.  In this case, the
facts are common ground.  There is, however, a disagreement as regards the
admissibility of a police sergeant's evidence in the break and enter charge
only and also in relation to Leaney only.  But that also is a question of law.

 

    As
this case requires that we deal with the charges separately as regards Leaney
and with the accused separately on the hold-up and arms charge, I will address
this latter disagreement in due course, that is when I address Leaney's appeal
of the hold-up conviction.

 

The
Robbery and Arms Charge

 

The Facts

 

    On
February 4, 1985, at approximately 7:00 p.m., two armed persons robbed the Owl
Drug Mart at 10713, 124th Street in Edmonton, taking a certain quantity of
drugs.  This robbery was witnessed by two employees of the drugstore.  The
smaller of the two persons was carrying a sawed-off rifle.  A few hours later,
a video camera captured a break-in by two men at Danlaur Drugs, which is a
drugstore situated about two miles away from Owl Drug Mart.

 

The
Evidence Against Leaney

 

    At
trial, the judge admitted as evidence in the hold-up charge that of the break
and enter as similar fact evidence.  This consisted of the videotape and
evidence by the police officers identifying the accused Leaney, as being the
taller person on the videotape.  As I said, all in the Court of Appeal agreed
that this was wrong and that that evidence was to be excluded.

 

    The
admissible evidence is that of a general description and circumstantial:

 

    Ahmed Hassan stated that he heard some running in
the pharmacy and saw a man with a mask, a toque over his face, carrying a
rifle.  He described this man as 5'7"" to 8"", kind of slim, 140
pounds.  He was wearing a blue denim jacket with a white collar, blue prints
and a toque.  He said the man had blue eyes and a blonde mustache.

 

                                                                          . . . 

 

Mr.
Hassan described the taller of the two men as 6'2"" to 6'4"", 160-170
pounds, quite thin, with a hunch in his back, also wearing a toque.  He was
wearing a short jean jacket, blue jean pants and wearing runners.  Both Ms.
Zemed and Mr. Hassan were very scared by the experience.  The robbery took
about 5 minutes and a large quantity of drugs was taken.

 

    The
police found in a garbage pail in the laundry room adjacent to Rawlinson's
suite, five small empty boxes marked ""Owl Drug Mart"".  These boxes
were identified as having come from the robbery.  A finger and palm print of
the appellant Leaney was found upon these boxes.

 

    Finally,
Leaney was seen in Rawlinson's apartment with an unidentified man the day
before the robbery.  The majority in the Court of Appeal stated that the man
was Rawlinson.  With respect, that had not been established; but not much turns
upon this.

 

    Once
excluded the evidence of the break and enter, there remains only, and I quote
from the Crown's factum, the following evidence:

 

a)Just hours after the commission of the robbery, boxes
taken in the robbery were found just outside Rawlinson's apartment with the
Appellant Leaney's fingerprints and palm prints upon them.

 

b)Leaney matched the general description of one of the
two culprits involved in the robbery.

 

c)The
association of Leaney with Rawlinson, who matched the description of the other
culprit . . . .

 

    While
one must acknowledge that a jury could reasonably convict on this evidence, we
could surely not conclude that this evidence is such that no jury could
reasonably acquit.  Accordingly, as would have Harradence J.A., I would order a
new trial for Leaney on the hold-up and arms charge.

 

The Evidence
Against Rawlinson

 

    There
is more of it than in Leaney's case but it is circumstantial only.  There is no
positive identification.  Harradence J.A. merely stated that it could not meet
the test of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).  The majority, however, were more specific and
listed the evidence they felt did, as follows at p. 379:

 

1.  Twelve to 14 hours after the robbery, boxes taken by
the robbers during the robbery were found in the laundry room next to
Rawlinson's apartment and Rawlinson admitted putting them there or having them
put there.

 

2.  The police recovered from Rawlinson's anal cavity a
bag containing 4 of the 12 kinds of drugs stolen during the robbery.

 

3.  The witness Soroka, based on what Rawlinson told
him, went and recovered a sawed-off rifle and turned it over to the police. 
The rifle was similar to the weapon described by witnesses as being carried by
the smaller person in the robbery.

 

4.  The witnesses to the robbery described the smaller
robber as being thin and short and carrying a sawed-off shotgun.  One witness
thought the smaller robber had a blonde mustache.  The evidence is that
Rawlinson was clean shaven but the description otherwise fits the general
physical description of Rawlinson.

 

5.  The day before the robbery the accused Leaney, who
is thin and tall (6 foot 2 inches to 6 foot 4 inches), was seen visiting the
apartment residence of Rawlinson.  The witnesses to the robbery described the
smaller robber's companion as being thin and tall (6 foot 2 inches to 6 foot 4
inches).

 

    Additionally,
the accused Rawlinson declined to testify at the trial despite the
incriminating circumstances heretofore listed.

 

With
respect, my reading of the evidence requires a small qualification to the
evidence referred to by the Court of Appeal.  Indeed, as regards the drugs
found in a bag in Mr. Rawlinson's rectum, there were found, along with four or
five drugs of the same kind taken from the drugstore, other drugs which were
identified as not coming from the robbery.

 

    I
agree with Harradence J.A. that the evidence adduced against Rawlinson does not
meet the test of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).  It is
evidence upon which a verdict of guilt could rest comfortably and stand well
beyond the reach of a court of appeal's determination that it was unreasonable
and could not be supported by the evidence.  But with respect for the views of
the majority, as has often been stated, much more is required under s. 613(1)(b)(iii). 
I would therefore allow Rawlinson's appeal as regards the hold-up and firearms
charge and order a new trial.

 

    There
remains the break and enter charge against Leaney.

 

Leaney
and the Break and Enter

 

    The
evidence is an identification by the judge upon viewing a video of the
burglary, coupled with the identification by a police sergeant who also viewed
the video.  The admissibility of the latter identification is contested and I
will be addressing that issue shortly.  In addition to the identification,
there is evidence of Leaney's association with Rawlinson, who is definitely
linked to the burglary.

 

    At
trial, the judge admitted as evidence the testimony of five police officers who
testified as to Leaney's identity as being the taller person on the videotape. 
It is common ground that this opinion evidence was inadmissible as regards four
of the five police officers.  As for the remaining officer, one Sergeant
Cessford, who had known the appellant Leaney for 15 years, it is common ground
that his opinion evidence could be received.  However, the appellant Leaney, at
trial and in this Court, but not in the Court of Appeal, takes the position
that this evidence could not be received without the holding of a voir dire as to
Sergeant Cessford's particular qualifications to give opinion evidence. 
Harradence J.A. proprio motu raised the matter
and excluded the evidence.  The position taken by the majority in the Court of
Appeal is best enunciated by quoting integrally what they said at pp. 380-81:

 

    On his appeal of the conviction for the break, enter
and theft, Leaney is faced with the finding of the trial judge that he was the
taller person shown on the videotape.  This is a finding of fact which the
trial judge was entitled to make and it is one which is entirely consistent
with the evidence tendered at trial, some of which is:

 

1.  Rawlinson has admitted that he is the smaller thief
shown in the videotape and the evening before the break and enter Rawlinson met
with the accused Leaney at the Rawlinson apartment.

 

2.  A baseball cap similar to that worn by the taller
thief in the break and enter was found several hours after the break and enter
in the car parked outside the Rawlinson residence and which has been associated
with Rawlinson's apartment.

 

3.  A liquid of the same sort as the cough syrup taken
in the break and enter was found outside that automobile and empty containers
of the same were found outside of the Rawlinson apartment.

 

4.  A baseball bat similar to the baseball bat seen
carried by the taller thief in the break and enter was seized at Rawlinson's
apartment.

 

5.  Clothing similar to some of the clothing worn by the
thieves in the break and entry was found at Rawlinson's apartment.

 

6.  Various police officers viewed the videotape, one of
whom was Sergeant Cessford.  Cessford has known the accused Leaney for 15 or 16
years and was able to identify Leaney as the taller thief in the videotape by
reference to Leaney's jaw, slouch, back and movements generally.

 

    In concluding that Leaney's conviction for the break
and entry ought to be quashed and a new trial ordered, Harradence J.A. put
emphasis on the fact that the trial judge refused a defence request for a voir
dire on the admissibility of police testimony identifying Leaney as the taller
person in the videotape.

 

    Neither in his factum nor in argument before us did
Leaney raise the refusal of the trial judge to hold a voir dire as a ground or
argument of appeal.  Notwithstanding that, I would be prepared to recall
counsel to argue the point if there was some possibility that a change in
result would occur.  But that is not the case.

 

    Even if the ruling was wrong and the trial judge
ought not to have heard or considered the testimony of the police officers on
this point, would a quashing of the conviction be warranted?  The trial judge
makes clear that his finding of fact that Leaney is the man in the videotape is
based upon his review of the videotape and of seeing Leaney every day during
the trial.  Indeed, in commenting on the impugned police evidence the trial judge
speaks of accepting it as it conforms to his own conclusion.  Finally, it is
clear that, had a voir dire been held, that Cessford's testimony would have
been allowed and his testimony is direct and unequivocal and based upon his
15-or 16-year acquaintance with the accused Leaney.

 

    In
short, if the trial judge was in error in refusing the voir dire and some
evidence was wrongly admitted, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred.

 

    This
is the evidence that Leaney faces, subject to the following qualification. 
There is no evidence that Leaney met Rawlinson on the eve of the burglary. 
There is evidence that at that time, Leaney met an unidentified person at
Rawlinson's apartment.  Furthermore, Rawlinson's admission that he is the smaller
burglar on the video is not, with respect, under the circumstances of this
case, admissible against Leaney.

 

    I
agree with Harradence J.A. that a voir dire should have been
held.  But, Sergeant Cessford, after having been heard, was fully
cross-examined; furthermore, Leaney did not raise the matter in the Court of
Appeal, and, in this Court, did not seek through affidavit evidence to indicate
in what way he was prejudiced in his defence by that omission.  I therefore
agree with Dea J. that the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
is properly operative as regards the trial judge's error and that if there is
to be a new trial, it cannot be grounded on this error committed by the trial
judge.

 

    Furthermore,
the trial judge made it clear that he had arrived at his conclusion
irrespective of what the sergeant or the others had to say.  While no doubt is
cast on the sincerity of the judge's assertion, one might argue that the
circumstances cast doubt on its accuracy or at least on the appearances
thereof.  We constantly ask jurors to disregard what they know through reading
the papers or viewing telecasts of the news; we tell them to disregard certain
answers given by witnesses;  we tell them that while certain evidence may be
used for one purpose, we will trust them not to use it for another.  I do not
see why judges cannot be trusted for same.  In fact, our judges hold voir dires on
confessions and sometimes reject them on grounds that in no way cast doubt on
their accuracy; they are expected to and are accepted as being capable of
deciding innocence or guilt without using their knowledge of the accused's
admission of guilt in the rejected confession.  So, if Plomp Prov. Ct. J. says
that he identified Leaney on the video independently and without the aid of the
identification of Sergeant Cessford, I am satisfied that there has not been any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, nor appearance thereof.  I would
therefore uphold Leaney's conviction for the break and enter.

 

Conclusion

 

    To
conclude, I would allow the appellant Rawlinson's and the appellant Leaney's
appeal of the robbery and use of arms convictions, set aside the conviction
entered below and order a new trial.  I would dismiss Leaney's appeal from the
break and enter charge.

 

//Wilson J.//

 

    The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

    WILSON J.
(dissenting in part) -- I have had the benefit of the reasons for judgment of
my colleagues, Justice McLachlin and Justice Lamer.  I agree with Lamer J. for
the reasons given by him that the convictions of Leaney and Rawlinson relating
to the robbery and firearms offences cannot stand and that a new trial must be
ordered.  However, unlike my colleagues, I would also order a new trial for
Leaney on the break and enter charge.

 

    The
evidence which was adduced in relation to the break and enter charge against
Leaney consisted of a videotape of the incident taken by a store security
camera.  The trial judge allowed the Crown to tender the opinion evidence of
five police officers who expressed the view that one of the persons they saw in
the videotape was Leaney.  Only one of these police officers, Sergeant
Cessford, had had any previous contact with Leaney.  At the conclusion of the
trial the trial judge made the following remarks with regard to the break and
enter charges against Rawlinson and Leaney:

 

    The two persons responsible for the commission of
the offence came into the range of the camera.  Again, the lighting was good,
focus was good but I could see no distortion of the picture whatsoever.  The
two men can be described as the shorter of the two, male Caucasian, wearing a
toque high on his head, jean jacket, pants, carrying a baseball bat.  There are
several good views of this person, and having observed Hugh Rawlinson in the
courtroom over a period of 16 days, I have no difficulty in saying without
hesitation that they, the man in the video, and Hugh Rawlinson, in the
courtroom, are one and the same.

 

    The taller of the two, second person; on the video,
he appears dark, long hair, Metis or Native appearance, very tall, much taller
than Rawlinson and there's a perfect example when they are standing back to
back when the hips of the taller man are almost to the height of the shoulders
of Rawlinson, much taller man.  Wearing a peaked cap of a baseball type which
subsequently shows in the video a tree on the right-hand side of the indicator
on the front of the cap which is similar to a cap seized by the police and was
an exhibit.  He's wearing a down filled type ski jacket, jeans with jacket,
appearing above the waist, a comb, round shaped tail, in the right rear
pocket.  These are not as good -- there is not as good a view of this face of
this person, but again having had the opportunity to view the video and the
accused, Frank Leaney in the court over 16 days, I have no difficulty in saying
without hesitation that they are one and the same; the man in the video is
Frank Leaney.

 

    Having
reached this conclusion myself, I have no trouble in accepting the evidence of
the police officers with their different knowledge of the two accused persons
and how they in their own way were able to identify the two accused from the
video.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
upholding Leaney's conviction by applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded
that the trial judge identified Leaney as one of the persons in the videotape
independently of the testimony of the police officers and it therefore did not
matter whether the evidence of the police officers ought to have been admitted
absent a voir dire or not.  In any event, the majority
of the Court of Appeal ruled that the testimony of one of the officers,
Sergeant Cessford, would have been admissible had a voir dire been
held.  The majority found Sergeant Cessford's evidence to be one of several
factors which supported the trial judge's finding of guilt.  These factors are
listed by the Court of Appeal in its reasons which are now reported at (1987),
55 Alta. L.R. (2d) 362, at pp. 380-81:

 

1.  Rawlinson has admitted that he is the smaller thief
shown in the videotape and the evening before the break and enter Rawlinson met
with the accused Leaney at the Rawlinson apartment.

 

2.  A baseball cap similar to that worn by the taller
thief in the break and enter was found several hours after the break and enter
in the car parked outside the Rawlinson residence and which has been associated
with Rawlinson's apartment.

 

3.  A liquid of the same sort as the cough syrup taken
in the break and enter was found outside that automobile and empty containers
of the same were found outside of the Rawlinson apartment.

 

4.  A baseball bat similar to the baseball bat seen
carried by the taller thief in the break and enter was seized at Rawlinson's
apartment.

 

5.  Clothing similar to some of the clothing worn by the
thieves in the break and entry was found at Rawlinson's apartment.

 

6. 
Various police officers viewed the videotape, one of whom was Sergeant
Cessford.  Cessford has known the accused Leaney for 15 or 16 years and was
able to identify Leaney as the taller thief in the videotape by reference to
Leaney's jaw, slouch back and movements generally.

 

As my
colleagues point out in their reasons, the appeal before this Court is
concerned solely with the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  The relevant portions of s. 613  read:

 

    613. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

(a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law . . .

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(b)  may dismiss an appeal where

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(iii) 
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in
subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred;

 

A
""substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" sufficient to preclude
the invocation of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) has been held to include a situation in which the
trial judge's error of law creates an appearance of unfairness: see R. v.
Hertrich (1982), 137 D.L.R. (3d) 400 (Ont. C.A.), leave to
appeal refused, [1982] 2 S.C.R. x, and R. v. Duke (1985),
39 Alta. L.R. (2d) 313 (C.A.)

 

    In
my opinion the trial judge erred in admitting the opinion evidence of at least
four of the police officers.  Opinion evidence is not admissible when the
witness offering the opinion is in no better position than the trier of fact to
assess the situation under scrutiny: see Graat v. The Queen, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 819, at p. 836.  The Crown submits that the outcome of the trial was
unaffected by the admission of this evidence since the trial judge stated that
he arrived at his conclusion independently of the impugned testimony.  I do
not, of course, question the sincerity of the trial judge's statement. 
However, it cannot be determined objectively what effect, if any, the admission
of the impugned evidence had on how the trial judge reached his opinion.  This
being so, the appearance of unfairness can exist even although it cannot be
shown that the admission of the evidence in fact influenced the trial judge.  I
believe that Harradence J.A. in the Court of Appeal below was correct in
drawing a parallel between the situation in the present case and one in which a
witness is asked to view a line-up already knowing whom the police suspect.  He
stated at p. 376:

 

    In a
situation such as this, the trier of fact becomes, in effect, an eyewitness to
the crime.  When called upon to determine whether the person in the video is
actually the accused, the trier of fact must do so in circumstances that are
not prejudicial.  Just as there is an element of unfairness when an eyewitness
knows before making an identification in a lineup who the police suspect, so
too the identification made by a trial judge will appear to be unfair if he already
knows the opinion of the police with respect to identity.  That is what
happened in the present case.  Even if the trial judge came to his conclusion
without the aid of the police officers' evidence, the circumstances under which
the identification was made had the appearance of unfairness.

 

    The
appearance of unfairness would have been dispelled had the trial judge
considered the evidence of the police officers and explicitly discounted it. 
The trier of fact in a criminal case, be it judge or jury, frequently hears
evidence which is not admissible or which is subsequently excluded or evidence
which is admissible for one purpose and not for another.  In such circumstances
the trier of fact is explicitly advised of the extent to which and for what
purposes the evidence may be used.  In such cases this admonition is sufficient
to purge the trial of any appearance of unfairness.  However, the trial judge
in this case not only did not expressly reject the evidence of the police
officers but used it to buttress his own conclusions, conclusions made after he
had heard the impugned testimony.  Under the circumstances, I am of the opinion
that the trial judge's admission and acceptance of the police officers'
testimony created, at the very least, an appearance of unfairness.

 

    It
has been argued that the identification of Leaney by Sergeant Cessford should
be treated differently from the identification by the other officers since
Cessford had previous contact with Leaney.  This may well be true.  However, a voir dire ought
to have been held by the trial judge to determine whether Cessford's knowledge
was such that his opinion ought to have been admitted.  In other words, would
Cessford's knowledge have provided the trial judge with vital information which
he would not otherwise have had?  Even if I were to assume that Sergeant
Cessford's testimony would have been ruled admissible had a voir dire been
held, I find that Cessford's identification evidence cannot be separated from
that of the other police officers.  The effect of the identification evidence
of the other police officers was to create an appearance of unfairness.  This
overall appearance cannot be dispelled by the fact that Cessford's evidence may
have been admissible.

 

    As a
consequence, unless there is some way in which this appearance of unfairness
can be dispelled, I do not think this Court can apply the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii). 
It is my view that the appearance of unfairness could only be dispelled if no
reliance were placed on the trial judge's reasons regarding the identification
of the man in the videotape.  The question then becomes whether there is
sufficient evidence apart from the identification of Leaney through the
videotape to compel the conclusion that the result reached by the trial judge
was the only possible result.  In considering this question I turn to the
factors listed and relied upon by the majority of the Court of Appeal.  In my
opinion, these factors standing by themselves are wholly inadequate to allow
for the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii).  The first
factor listed, that Rawlinson and Leaney had met the previous day, is
inaccurate in that, as Lamer J. points out, it was never established at trial
that Leaney and Rawlinson met that day.  All that was established at trial was
that Leaney was present at Rawlinson's apartment and had met with an
unidentified person.  Rawlinson's apartment had the reputation of being ""a
shooting gallery"", a place where numerous individuals met to traffic in
and consume drugs.  It is entirely conceivable that Leaney met someone other
than Rawlinson the day before the break-in.  As for factors two to five, none
of them reveal any connection to Leaney.  Factor six re-introduces the issue of
identification of Leaney by the police officers, an issue which I have already
concluded created an appearance of unfairness.

 

    Since
the admissible evidence against Leaney is inadequate to compel the conclusion
that a properly instructed trier of fact would necessarily have convicted him
of the break and enter charge, I am unwilling to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii). 
In the result, therefore, I would, along with Lamer J., order a new trial for
Rawlinson and Leaney in respect of their robbery and firearms charges. 
Additionally, however, I would order a new trial for Leaney in respect of his
break and enter charge.

judgment of L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

    MCLACHLIN J. --

 

Introduction

 

    Rawlinson
and Leaney appeal from their convictions of offences related to a robbery of
one drugstore and a break-in of another drugstore, both in North Edmonton, over
the course of the night of February 4 - 5, 1985.  The main issue at trial and
on appeal concerned the identity of the robbers and of the thieves.   The
evidence respecting identity took the form of eye-witness testimony about the
robbery, some circumstantial evidence tending to connect the accused with the
two crimes, and a videotape of the break-in, supplemented by the opinion
evidence of five police officers as to the identity of the two thieves depicted
therein.

 

    I am
satisfied that two fundamental errors occurred at trial.  The first was that
the trial judge treated evidence of the second incident, the break-in, as
similar fact evidence going to the identification of the accused on the charges
arising out of the first incident, the robbery.

 

    The
second error was the admission of the evidence of the police officers as to the
identity of the persons shown on the videotape.  Four of the officers had no
acquaintance with the accused and were in no better position than the trial
judge to say whether the persons shown in the video were the accused.  Thus
their evidence could not assist and should not have been received.  The fifth,
Sergeant Cessford, knew one of the accused, Leaney, since childhood, and had
spent time with him shortly before the two incidents.  The judge erred in not
determining as a preliminary matter the qualification of Sergeant Cessford
before receiving his evidence, as well as that of the other police officers. 
However, this failure is irrelevant in the case of Cessford, since I am
satisfied his evidence was clearly admissible in any event.  I note in this
regard that Cessford was cross-examined thoroughly as to his acquaintance with
Leaney.

 

    Error
being established, the only question is whether the Court of Appeal erred in
upholding the conviction under s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  Subsection 613(1) provides in
part:

 

    613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(ii)  the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law . . .

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred;

 

The Case
Against Leaney

 

    The
main identification evidence against Leaney on the charges arising out the
second incident, which I shall refer to as the break-in incident, was the
evidence of the videotape and the testimony of the police officers concerning
the identity of the thieves captured on the videotape.

 

    The
trial judge viewed the videotape several times and had ample opportunity during
the course of the sixteen-day trial to form an opinion as to whether the
persons shown on the tape were the accused.  The tape contained several face
shots of each accused.  At the end of the trial, the trial judge stated that he
had formed the firm conclusion that the persons shown on the videotape were the
accused.  His pronouncements make it clear that this opinion was formed
independently of the evidence of any of the police officers on the question. 
He stated:

 

    The two persons responsible for the commission of
the offence came into the range of the camera.  Again, the lighting was good,
focus was good but I could see no distortion of the picture whatsoever.  The
two men can be described as the shorter of the two, male Caucasian, wearing a
toque high on his head, jean jacket, pants, carrying a baseball bat.  There are
several good views of this person, and having observed Hugh Rawlinson in the
courtroom over a period of 16 days, I have no difficulty in saying without
hesitation that they, the man in the video, and Hugh Rawlinson, in the
courtroom, are one and the same.

 

    The taller of the two, second person; on the video,
he appears dark, long hair, Metis or Native appearance, very tall, much taller
than Rawlinson and there's a perfect example when they are standing back to
back when the hips of the taller man are almost to the height of the shoulders
of Rawlinson, much taller man.  Wearing a peaked cap of a baseball type which
subsequently shows in the video a tree on the right-hand side of the indicator
on the front of the cap which is similar to a cap seized by the police and was
an exhibit.  He's wearing a down-filled type ski jacket, jeans with jacket,
appearing above the waist, a comb, round shaped tail, in the right rear
pocket.  These are not as good -- there is not as good a view of this face of
this person, but again having had the opportunity to view the video and the
accused, Frank Leaney in the court over 16 days, I have no difficulty in saying
without hesitation that they are one and the same;  the man in the video is
Frank Leaney.

 

    Having
reached this conclusion myself, I have no trouble in accepting the evidence of
the police officers with their different knowledge of the two accused persons
and how they in their own way were able to identify the two accused from the
video.

 

    Given
the trial judge's clear statement that he arrived at his conclusion as to
identity independently of the evidence of the police officers, their evidence
assumes the character of mere surplusage, which does not vitiate the judge's
conclusion that Leaney was one of persons shown on the video screen.  To put it
another way, the judge, properly instructing himself, concluded beyond a
reasonable doubt that Leaney participated in the break-in.  The fact that the
judge had before him inadmissible evidence does not impair that independent
conclusion, if he did not rely on the inadmissible evidence in reaching it.

 

    It
was also argued that quite apart from whether Leaney suffered actual prejudice
as a result of the reception of the inadmissible evidence, its admission, and
particularly the admission of the evidence of the four police officers who
testified as to the identity of the persons shown on the video despite no
familiarity of the accused, created an appearance of unfairness which amounted
to a miscarriage of justice, making s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  inapplicable: see R. v. Hertrich (1982),
137 D.L.R. (3d) 400 (Ont. C.A.), per Martin J.A.  I
cannot accept this submission.  There is no appearance of unfairness where the
judge expressly arrives at his or her conclusion on the critical issue
independently of the inadmissible evidence.  Judges often hear evidence which
turns out to be inadmissible, for example on voir dires.  So
long as the judge does not consider such evidence in arriving at his or her
independent conclusion, no unfairness can be said to arise, nor has there been
a miscarriage of justice.

 

    I
conclude that the Court of Appeal did not err in concluding that the conviction
of Leaney on the counts relating to the break-in should stand under s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , notwithstanding the reception of inadmissible
evidence.   The test set out in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739 is met: there is no possibility that a reasonable jury, properly
instructed and acting judicially, could fail to convict on the admissible
evidence presented on the break-in incident.

 

    I
turn next to the convictions relating to the first incident, which I shall
refer to as the robbery.  In arriving at his conclusions as to identity on
these offences, the trial judge erroneously referred to his conclusions on the
break-in incident, praying in aid the doctrine of similar fact evidence.  The
question is whether there was sufficient evidence without using the
identification on the break-in incident to permit the conclusion that no jury,
properly instructed, could have acquitted Leaney on the charges relating to the
robbery.

 

    I
agree with Lamer J. that the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could
acquit Leaney on the charges relating to the robbery, and that the Court of
Appeal erred in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) to these
charges.

 

The Case
Against Rawlinson

 

    Rawlinson
does not appeal from his convictions arising out of the break-in incident.  He
appeals from his conviction for robbery and the associated firearms charge on
the ground that the trial judge erred in using the evidence on the break-in charges
as similar fact evidence on the robbery charges.  There is no doubt that the
trial judge wrongly considered that evidence. The only question is whether the
Court of Appeal was correct in upholding the conviction under s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

 

    The
case against Rawlinson on the robbery charges, considered in the absence of the
similar fact evidence from the break and enter charge, is impressive.  It may
be summarized as follows:

 

    (1)The boxes which were taken in the armed robbery
were found just outside Rawlinson's apartment hours after the robbery, and he
admitted to Lyseyko, a fellow inmate who testified for the prosecution at
trial, that he had been involved in the placing of those boxes at that
location.

 

    (2)Rawlinson tried to convince Lyseyko to take
responsibility for the involvement alleged against him in relation to the
robbery.

 

    (3)Some of the drugs were found in Rawlinson's anal
cavity which were consistent with some of the drugs stolen during the robbery.

 

    (4)The weapon similar to the one described as being
used in the robbery was turned over to the police as a result of a conversation
with Rawlinson.

 

    (5)The description of one of the participants in the
robbery matches the general description of Rawlinson.

 

    (6)The companion of the person matching Rawlinson's
description in the robbery match the description of Leaney who was seen with
Rawlinson on the videotape subsequent to the robbery.

 

    (7)Like Leaney, Rawlinson failed to testify in the
face of this highly incriminating evidence.

 

It is
well-established that in considering whether a conviction may be upheld under
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , the
court may take into account the accused's failure to explain evidence which
connects him with the crime: Avon v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.
650, at p. 657.

 

    I am
of the view that a trial judge or jury, applying the law correctly to this
evidence, could not possibly entertain a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
Rawlinson.  The Court of Appeal was correct in concluding that no reasonable
jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could fail to convict
Rawlinson on the admissible evidence presented at trial.

    Criminal
law -- Possession of weapon for a purpose dangerous to public peace -- Accused
intoxicated when ordering police from home with shotgun -- Appellate court
setting aside acquittal and entering conviction ‑‑ Whether or
not elements of offence made out -- Whether or not Court of Appeal erred in
ordering conviction instead of new trial -- Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 85, 613(4)(a), (b)(i), (ii).

 

    Courts
-- Appeal -- Appellate court setting aside acquittal and entering conviction --
Intoxication giving rise to question as to ability to form requisite intent --
Whether or not elements of offence made out -- Whether or not Court of Appeal
erred in ordering conviction instead of new trial.

 

    Two
police officers attended at the home of the appellant's mother to investigate
the recovery of her missing car in a damaged condition.  The appellant, who
appeared drunk and belligerent during questioning by police, forced the
officers from the house with a shotgun.  He was arrested when he came out of
the house unarmed and was charged with possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace contrary to s. 85  of the Criminal
Code .  The trial judge found that the elements of the
offence ‑‑ possession and a prior intent for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace ‑‑ had not been met since on the
facts there was no appreciable gap between the possession of the gun and the
confrontation with the officers.  He also noted that appellant had been in an
advanced state of intoxication.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the
acquittal and entered a conviction pursuant to s. 613(4)(b)(ii) of
the Code.  The appellant appealed as of right, requesting that
that decision be overturned and that his acquittal be restored or that a new
trial be ordered.  The issues addressed by this Court were:  (1) whether the
trial judge erred in determining that the elements of the offence were not made
out because there was no gap in time between the formation of the unlawful
purpose and the use of the weapon; and, (2) whether the Court of Appeal erred
in law in ordering a conviction instead of a new trial, in light of the defence
that the appellant was too intoxicated to be able to form the necessary
intent.  The Court also stated constitutional questions as to whether s.
613(4)(b)(ii) of the Code contravened ss. 7 
and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and if
so, whether it was justified under s. 1 .

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

    Section
85  requires proof of possession and proof that the purpose of that possession
was one dangerous to the public peace.  There must at some point in time be a
meeting of these two elements.  Generally, the purpose will have been formed
prior to the taking of possession and will continue as possession is taken. 
Appellant had stated that the police should leave or he would get them out. 
Assuming that he was capable of forming the requisite intent notwithstanding
his intoxication, his intent, evidenced by the threats to the officers, was to
use the gun to expel the officers from his mother's house.  At the point that
he took possession of the gun for that purpose, the offence was complete.

 

    The
test established at common law with respect to setting aside an acquittal and
entering a verdict of guilty is as follows:  an appellate court may overturn an
acquittal and enter a conviction rather than ordering a new trial where the
Crown satisfies the Court that, had there been a proper application of the law,
the verdict would not have been the same, and further demonstrates that
the accused should have been found guilty but for the error of law.  All the
findings necessary to support a verdict of guilty must have been made, either
explicitly or implicitly, or not be in issue.  The Court of Appeal did not
correctly apply this test because all the findings of fact necessary to a
verdict of guilty were not necessarily made.  Although the trial judge made
reference to the issue of the appellant's state of intoxication, the record did
not clearly indicate that he had considered the issue of whether his
drunkenness interfered with his ability to form the intent to commit the
offence.  In fact, once having found that there was no significant gap in time
between the formation of the unlawful purpose and the use of the weapon, he was
not required to further consider the possible effect of intoxication.  There
accordingly was room for doubt as to what the trial judge would have found had
he fully considered the issue of intoxication.  The appeal, therefore,  was
allowed to the extent that a new trial should be ordered in the stead of
entering a conviction.

 

    It
was not necessary to deal with the issue of whether s. 613(4)(b)(ii) of
the Code contravened the appellant's rights under the Charter  in the
circumstances of this case.

residing with his mother, Alice Bieber, at her home in Windsor, Ontario.  On
the eve of the incident, when Mrs. Bieber went to bed, the appellant had gone
out.  Early the next morning, Mrs. Bieber found that her car, which she had
left parked in the driveway, was missing.  She assumed that the appellant had
taken it.  The appellant told her he had not taken the car and told her to call
the police.  Shortly thereafter, two uniformed officers attended at her home
informing Mrs. Bieber that her car had been recovered earlier that night in a
damaged condition.  She indicated to the police that perhaps her son knew something
about the car.  The events that took place after this first conversation lasted
less than five minutes.

 

    One
of the officers started questioning the appellant but the latter immediately
became upset and aggressive, verbally abusing the two officers, accusing them
of trespassing and ordering them to get off the property.  At that moment, Mrs.
Bieber stepped in between her son and the officers and tried without success to
persuade her son to go back to bed as she felt that he was drunk and belligerent. 
The appellant ignored his mother's request and persisted in demanding that the
officers leave the house, threatening that he would get them out of the house
if they did not leave by themselves.  At this point, the appellant ran into the
living room where there was a gun rack holding several guns.  He grabbed one
12-gauge shotgun from the rack.  Both officers, aware of the presence of the
guns, tried to draw their guns but in their haste and confusion experienced
difficulty in doing so and hurriedly left the house, exiting in opposite
directions.  A very short time later, the appellant came out of the house
without the gun, and in vulgar language continued to exhort the police officers
to leave.  He indicated that he did not have a gun.  He was immediately
arrested on a charge of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace, contrary to s. 85 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34.

 

Judgments
Below

 

    Dunlap
Dist. Ct. J. first outlined the elements that the Crown must prove under s. 85
of the Code: first, possession; and second, the prior intent for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace.  In his view, the question was whether
the possession could be separated in time from the actus reus so as
to permit proof of the intent essential to the proof of an offence pursuant to
that section.  Although he acknowledged that here the possession and the actual
use were concurrent and undoubtedly constituted a serious assault vis-à-vis the
police officers, he concluded:

 

    Here
there is little or no time gap between the formation of the unlawful purpose
and the use -- but the accused did not have possession of the gun when he
initiated his wild rush towards the gun rack.  And on these same facts there is
no appreciable gap between his seizing possession of the gun and his
confrontation of the officers, whatever offence he committed in law by his rash
action.  I find that these unique circumstances cannot establish the elements
of the offence under s. 85 as defined by Dubin J.A. in Regina v.
Proverbs and an acquittal is therefore entered.

 

    In
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the Crown's appeal was allowed and a unanimous
bench entered a conviction pursuant to s. 613(4)(b)(ii)
for the following brief reasons:

 

    We think this appeal must succeed.  On the findings
of fact made by the trial judge, the respondent had the intention of using the
weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, to wit, assault of a police
officer prior to and throughout the taking of possession of the weapon.  While
on its facts this case is different from R. v. Proverb [sic]
(1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 249, on its facts as found by the trial judge this case
meets the test laid down by Dubin J.A. in R. v. Proverb [sic] at p.
251 in that at the moment in time preceding the taking of possession of the
weapon, the respondent intended to possess it for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace.

 

    Accordingly,
we are of the view that the learned trial judge erred in his understanding and
application of the law.  The appeal is allowed, the acquittal is set aside, a
conviction is entered and the case is remitted to the trial judge for
sentencing.

 

    This
is the judgment that is appealed from before this Court.

 

Points
in Issue

 

    This
appeal raises three issues.

 

- First, did the trial judge err in determining that the
elements of the offence were not made out because there was no gap in time
between the formation of the unlawful purpose and the use of the weapon?

 

- Second, does s. 613(4) (b)(ii) of
the Criminal Code  permitting the Court of Appeal to substitute a
conviction for an acquittal contravene the appellant's rights under the Charter  in the
circumstances of this case?

 

- Finally, did the Court of Appeal err in law in
entering a conviction instead of ordering a new trial, in light of the defence
of intoxication submitted by the appellant?

 

Legislation

 

    I
reproduce the sections of the Code which are relevant
to the present case:

 

    85.  Every
one who carries or has in his possession a weapon or imitation thereof, for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace or for the purpose of committing an
offence, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
ten years.

 

    613. . . . 

 

    (4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court
of appeal may 

 

    (a) dismiss the appeal; or

 

    (b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i)  order a new trial, or

 

(ii)except
where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter a
verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error of law, and pass a
sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and
direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

 

Analysis

 

The first issue: did the trial judge err in determining that the
elements of the offence were not made out because there was no gap in time
between the formation of the unlawful purpose and the use of the weapon charged?

 

    Section
85 requires proof of possession and proof that the purpose of that possession
was one dangerous to the public peace.  There must at some point in time be a
meeting of these two elements.  Generally, the purpose will have been formed
prior to the taking of possession and will continue as possession is taken. 
That is the case before us.  Assuming that the appellant was capable of forming
the requisite intent notwithstanding his intoxication (a matter dealt with
under the third issue), he intended to use the shotgun to expel the police
officers from his mother's house.  This is evident from his shouting ""You
get out, or I'll get you out"".  He then took possession of the gun.  At
that point in time, the offence was complete.

 

    There
are sometimes evidentiary problems in cases involving s. 85.  They mainly arise
out of three situations.  First, when what is being used is not designed to be
a weapon and where it is through the use of the instrument that it is concluded
that it is a weapon under s. 2 of the Code (see R. v.
Chomenko (1974), 18 C.C.C. (2d) 353 (Ont. C.A.))  The second
kind of evidentiary problem arises when proof of the purpose is through the
actual use of the weapon (see as an illustration of this problem, R. v.
Flack, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 55 (B.C.C.A.); R. v.
Chalifoux (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 526 (B.C.C.A.))  The third
evidentiary problem is when the possession is lawful and prior to the formation
of the unlawful purpose, which problem is compounded when proof of the latter
is solely through the use of the weapon (see R. v. Chiplick (1960),
128 C.C.C. 45 (Ont. C.A.))  Proof of the dangerous use of the weapon standing
alone has been said not to be sufficient to constitute the offence as Dubin
J.A., for the Ontario Court of Appeal, stated in R. v. Proverbs (1983),
9 C.C.C. (3d) 249, at p. 251:

 

The use
of the weapon in a manner dangerous to the public peace does not constitute the
offence although the formation of the unlawful purpose may be inferred from the
circumstances in which the weapon was used

 

and
noted later, at p. 251:

 

The formation of the unlawful purpose, which may be
inferred from the circumstances in which the weapon is used, must precede its
use.  The interval of time between the formation of the
purpose and the use of the weapon need not be long.  It may in some cases be
very short, but the gap must be significant.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

    These
situations and the cases addressing them need not be considered as in this case
possession followed the formation of the purpose, and the purpose need not be
inferred from the use of the gun; but assuming the accused was not incapable
because of drunkenness of forming the requisite intent, and assuming that the
purpose continued up to and including the time of possession, the purpose would
clearly be established by the accused's threats to the police officers.  The
trial judge, in my respectful view, was wrong in applying the decisions in R. v.
Proverbs and R. v. Flack to the facts in
this case, that is, a case in which the use of the weapon is not the sole
evidence of the purpose.

 

The second issue: does s. 613(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code permitting
the Court of Appeal to substitute a conviction for an acquittal contravene the
appellant's rights under the Charter in the circumstances of this case?

 

    On
January 13, 1989, an order issued from Chief Justice Dickson calling for notice
of constitutional questions.  Those were stated as follows:

 

1.Is section 613(4)(b)(ii) of
the Criminal Code  of Canada inconsistent with s. 7  and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  in that s. 613(4) (b)(ii)
permits the Court of Appeal to substitute a verdict of guilty for an acquittal
at trial?

 

2.If
section 613(4)(b)(ii) is inconsistent with s. 7 and/or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is s. 613(4) (b)(ii) justified
under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

    However,
the appellant fails to argue before this Court that s. 613(4)(b)(ii) of
the Code should be declared of no force or effect pursuant to s.
52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  Further, that
issue was not raised in the courts below.  In fact, in his order requested, the
appellant seeks no such declaration.  Instead, he has chosen to frame his
argument as whether s. 613(4) (b)(ii), by
permitting the Court of Appeal to substitute a conviction for an acquittal,
contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  in
the circumstances of this case.  By requesting that the acquittal be
restored or a new trial ordered, the appellant is in effect requesting a remedy
pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter  on the ground that the Court of
Appeal erred by exercising their option in favour of substituting a conviction
rather than ordering a new trial.  This raises an important issue regarding the
applicability of the Charter  to a court which has exercised
discretion given to it by a provision of the Code. 
Further, can remedy be sought under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  if the
exercise of that discretion is shown to infringe one's guaranteed rights?  In
my view, though important, a discussion of these issues should be reserved for
a more appropriate case as this case can be disposed of in favour of the
appellant by reference to well-established principles of common law under the
third issue.  I note, in addition, that this issue was not addressed by counsel
in their submissions before this Court.

 

The third issue: did the Court of Appeal err in law in ordering a
conviction instead of a new trial, in light of the defence of intoxication
submitted by the appellant?

 

    On
that point, the debate emerges over the meaning of the trial judge's following
assertion:

 

The accused
was present at the time, in an advanced state of intoxication, when the
officers interviewed his mother concerning her complaint.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    In
the appellant's view, the trial judge's finding of fact of his ""advanced
state of intoxication"" raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he had the
capacity to form the unlawful purpose.  That being so, an appellate court may
find support for upholding an acquittal when the mental processes of an
intoxicated person are in issue.  However, the converse is not true.  An
appellate court, which has not had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of
the witnesses and which is acting on a Crown appeal restricted to a question of
law alone, cannot say, with the required degree of certainty demanded for a criminal
conviction that, notwithstanding the advanced state of intoxication of the
appellant, he still had the requisite mental capacity to form the unlawful
purpose.  An appellate court can, at most, grant the remedy of a new trial and
cannot order a conviction in substitution for the acquittal originally
granted.  In other words, the appellant contends that he is entitled to have
this defence appropriately dealt with in the course of a new trial.

 

    The
Crown replies that the Court of Appeal may allow a Crown appeal against an
acquittal entered by a trial judge and substitute a verdict of guilty where the
Crown establishes that an error of law was committed at trial, satisfies the
Court of Appeal that, had there been a proper application of the law, the verdict
would not have been the same, and further demonstrates that the accused
should have been found guilty but for the error of law.  In this respect, the
principle that has been established at common law is that all the findings
necessary to support a verdict of guilty must have been made, either explicitly
or implicitly, or not be in issue (Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977]
2 S.C.R. 277, at pp. 291-92, and R. v. Courville (1982),
2 C.C.C. (3d) 118 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 125, aff. sub nom., Courville
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 847).  In the Crown's view, the trial
judge made all the findings of fact necessary to support a verdict of guilty. 
His error was in his application of the law to the facts, when he imposed on
the Crown the additional burden of having to prove, in effect, deliberation on
the part of the appellant.  Concerning the issue of intoxication, the Crown
submits that this matter was raised at trial, considered by the judge, who
nevertheless went on to find that the appellant formed the unlawful purpose. 
Finally, the Crown pointed out that the appellant did not testify on that point
at trial.

 

    What
is at issue, then, is whether the Court of Appeal correctly applied the test
established at common law to the facts of this case.  I am not satisfied that
the trial judge made all the findings of fact necessary to support a verdict of
guilty.  Although he adverted to the issue of the appellant's state of
intoxication, it is not clear on the record that he fully considered whether
his intoxication interfered with his ability to form the intent to commit the
offence charged.  In fact, once having found that there was no significant gap
in time between the formation of the unlawful purpose and the use of the
weapon, he was not required to further consider the effect that intoxication
might have had on the appellant's ability to form the requisite intent.  In
short, we cannot be sure what his finding would have been if he had fully
considered the issue of intoxication.

 

    In
view of the appellant's right to a fair hearing, it is important that the test
established at common law be strictly applied. Therefore, this matter should be
sent back for a new trial where the issue of intoxication could be fully
considered.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, but only to the extent that
a new trial should be ordered in the stead of entering a conviction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

    Criminal
law -- Young offenders -- Transfer to ordinary court ‑‑ Requirements
-- Young offender just under 18 years of age charged with first degree murder
-- Crown's application for transfer to ordinary court dismissed by Youth Court
judge -- Youth Court's decision affirmed by Court of Queen's Bench but reversed
by Court of Appeal -- Nature of burden on the Crown for transfer to ordinary
court -- Nature of review on appeal -- Test for transfer -- Whether Court of
Appeal erred in ordering youth to be transferred to ordinary court -- Young
Offenders Act, S.C. 1980‑81‑82-83, c. 110, ss. 3,
16 .

 

    S.H.M.
and an another youth, J.E.L., were charged with first degree murder and with
possession of stolen property.  The Crown brought an application to have them
transferred to ordinary court pursuant to s. 16  of the Young
Offenders Act.  The Crown contended that on April 30, 1986, they
accompanied a homosexual male to his home.  The man allegedly attempted sexual
relations with one of the youth who struck him and rendered him
unconscious.  The youths then bound the man with electrical wire,
strangled him and concealed the body in the basement.  They lived in the
victim's house some days and tried to dispose of his stereo and computer
equipment.  S.H.M. was almost 18 years old at the time of the alleged
offences.  Emotionally he is described as being thirteen or fourteen.  He
had a prior conviction for two counts of gross indecency involving 9 and 10‑year‑old
boys.  S.H.M., who had a difficult childhood, claimed that he was also a
victim of sexual abuse when he was younger.  He was described by psychiatrists
and social workers as an extremely self‑conscious, insecure young man.  A
social history report prepared on S.H.M. indicated that adult prison ""will
be destructive for this young person"" and that ""the combination of
his immaturity, sexual identity confusion, and exaggerated need for approval by
others will be disastrous for him in the prison culture"".

 

    The
Youth Court judge considered the factors set out in s. 16(2) of the Act
and the principles set out in s. 3 and declined to order the transfer.  He
concluded that there was a ""heavy onus"" on the Crown to establish why
a transfer should be granted.  The Court of Queen's Bench upheld the ruling. 
The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment.  The court rejected the Youth Court
judge's conclusion that there was a heavy onus on the applicant seeking an
order for transfer and found that under s. 16(9) and (10) the provincial
appellate courts must apply their own discretion in reviewing the circumstances
of the case.  After a review of the relevant factors and considerations, the
court concluded that it was in ""the interests of society, having regard to
the needs of S.H.M."", that the youth be transferred to ordinary court. 
This appeal is to determine (1) whether there was a burden on the Crown to
establish that the transfer should be made; (2) whether provincial reviewing
tribunals have an independent discretion in deciding the question of transfer;
and (3) whether Court of Appeal properly applied the test for transfer.

 

    Held (La
Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  The Court
of Appeal did not err in the view it took of the nature of the burden on the
Crown.  The party seeking transfer to ordinary court must persuade the court
that, having regard to the factors set out in s. 16(2) and (3) of the Act,
the case should be transferred.  While, in this sense, there is a burden on the
party seeking transfer, the burden should not be regarded as a heavy one. 
Section 16 does not confine the transfer to ordinary court to exceptional cases
but is consistent with the conclusion that transfer must appear as the right or
proper solution.  The question is whether the judge is satisfied, after
weighing and balancing all the relevant considerations, that the case should be
transferred to ordinary court.

 

    The
Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that the Act conferred on it the
discretion to independently evaluate whether a transfer should be made. 
Section 16(9) and (10) of the Act empowers the superior court of the province
to review the decision of the Youth Court judge and, ""in its
discretion"", to confirm or reverse it.  The Court of Appeal has the same
mandate in reviewing the decision of the superior court judge.  While the
reviewing court must base its decision on the findings of fact made by the
Youth Court judge and give due deference to that judge's evaluation of the
evidence, the Act confers on the provincial reviewing court a discretion to
make an independent evaluation and to arrive at an independent conclusion on
those facts.  This involves evaluation, not only of whether the court
below made an error of law or jurisdiction, but of whether its conclusions are
correct based on the factors set out in the Act.

 

    The
Court of Appeal properly applied the relevant factors for transfer from Youth
Court to ordinary court.  The court considered the seriousness of the offence,
as well as the age of the accused and the inappropriateness of a three‑year
sentence under the Act (given the heinous nature of the alleged crimes), to be
important factors.  But the court also properly bore in mind all the
factors which must be considered under s. 16.  It is inevitable that, in
the course of the review, some factors will assume greater importance than
others, depending on the nature of the case and the viewpoint of the tribunal. 
The Act does not require that all factors be given equal weight, but only that
each be considered.

 

    This
Court has no power under the Act to substitute its discretion for that of the
court below.  The jurisdiction of the Court is limited to correction of error
in the proceedings below.

 

    Per La
Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. (dissenting):  The transfer of a youth to
ordinary court should only be ordered in exceptional cases.  In view of the
history, purpose and basic philosophy of the legislation as well as the English
and French texts of s. 16(1),  the transfer of a youth to ordinary court under
s. 16 must propose itself to the Youth Court judge's mind as the only
appropriate solution.  The decision to release a youth to the ordinary criminal
enforcement process represents an abdication by the youth system of its
exclusive jurisdiction to deal with young offenders and deprives the youth of
his entitlement to the rehabilitative philosophy and treatment resources of the
system specially designed to meet his needs.  Here, the Court of Appeal
misconceived the burden of proof required for a transfer.  Section 16 sets a
threshold more onerous than simply ""favouring"" transfer.  The burden
falls squarely on the applicant to persuade the Youth Court that no solution
other than transfer is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case. 
The Court of Appeal's error pervaded its assessment of the evidence relating to
the elements to be considered in s. 16.

 

     Under
s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act, a provincial reviewing court is not
authorized to substitute its own evaluation of the circumstances for the
evaluation of the Youth Court.  The scope of the discretion to review a matter
properly brought into appeal must be interpreted in light of the general
economy of the Act and of the legislative grant of exclusive jurisdiction to a
specialized tribunal empowered to make the initial determination at the
transfer hearing.  The discretion to confirm or reverse the decision of the
Youth Court under s. 16(9) and (10) can only be exercised in cases where there
is a serious ground for intervention.  Errors of fact as well as errors of law would
constitute such serious grounds, but the test is intended to allow a somewhat
broader basis for review.  In some cases, it could allow the discretion to
review to be exercised where there is a substantial discrepancy between the
reviewing court's and the Youth Court's assessment of the relevant
factors.  This test recognizes the privileged position of the transfer
hearing judge in determining questions of fact in the Youth Court's area of
expertise and makes fitting allowance for the judge's familiarity with the
resources of the youth care system, while at the same time breathing life into
the right of appeal.

 

     In
this case, the Court of Appeal erred in proceeding on the basis that it could
simply substitute its own appreciation as to whether a transfer should be
ordered.  The Youth Court judge considered the factors set out in s. 16(2)
and was convinced that the Crown had failed on its burden to show why a
transfer should be ordered.  In the Young Court judge's view, the element of
seriousness of the offence and the circumstances surrounding it, which favoured
transfer, were outweighed by the other elements, which were either neutral or
weighed against transfer.  The available treatment facilities and the character
of the youth gave rise to a sufficient likelihood that treatment would be
successful.  As the youth would not be likewise amenable to rehabilitation in
the ordinary penal system, the balancing test under s. 16(1) and (2) required
that S.H.M. not be transferred.  This is a case where the additional expertise
of the Youth Court and its privileged situation in assessing the expert
testimony should have prevailed over only minor differences of opinion in the
Court of Appeal.  No error of law or of fact was committed by the Youth Court. 
In the absence of any serious ground for intervention, this conclusion should
have determined the fate of S.H.M. as regards his transfer to the ordinary
court system.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and
McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

    MCLACHLIN J. --
This appeal concerns the requirements for transfer of young offenders from
Youth Court to ordinary court under the Young Offenders Act, S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 110. 

 

    The
appellant, a youth as defined by the Young Offenders Act,  was
charged with another youth, J.E.L, with the offence of first degree murder,
contrary to s. 218(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, and possession of stolen property of a value exceeding $1000, contrary to
s. 313 (a) of the Criminal Code .  The
proceedings against the two youths proceeded separately until the appeal to
this Court.  In each case, the Crown applied to have S.H.M. and J.E.L.,
respectively, transferred to ordinary court for trial pursuant to s. 16  of the Young
Offenders Act .  Each of the youths successfully resisted the
applications in Youth Court and in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench on
review.  The Crown then appealed each case to the Alberta Court of Appeal.  In
separate judgments the Court of Appeal ordered that both youths should be
transferred to adult court.  This Court granted S.H.M. leave to appeal the
order of the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, on October 2, 1987, [1987] 2
S.C.R. x, and granted J.E.L. leave to appeal on April 25, 1988, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
x.  The appeals were heard together before this Court on April 27, 1989.

 

The
Facts

 

     The
Crown alleges that on April 30, 1986 S.H.M. and J.E.L. accompanied a wealthy
male of about fifty years of age to a store to rent two ""adult""
movies and then to his home.  The man, a homosexual, was known to the youths.  
There is some evidence the man may have attempted sexual relations with J.E.L.,
whereupon J.E.L. struck the man in the head and stomach, rendering him
unconscious.   It is alleged that the youths then bound the man with electrical
wire and strangled him with such force that a bone in his neck was broken.   He
died from asphyxiation by strangulation.   The youths are alleged to have then
taken the body to the basement of the house where they attempted to conceal it
in a piece of carpet.   They continued to reside in the victim's house at least
until May 2, 1986 whilst commencing the wholesale disposition of the victim's
stereo and computer equipment.   The body was not found until two weeks later
as a consequence of attempts by the owner of the video store to find out why
the deceased had not returned the videos.   A coroner placed the death on or
about May 1, 1986.

 

    S.H.M.
was l7 years and 11 months old at the time of the alleged offence.   He had a
prior conviction for two counts of gross indecency involving two male children
aged 9 and 10 years respectively, for which he had received a suspended
sentence with three years' probation.   His childhood appears to have been a
difficult one.   His father was a chronic alcoholic who left home when S.H.M.
was 7 or 8 years old.   S.H.M. claims that he had been the victim of sexual
abuse by an older brother over a three-year period when he was 7 to l0 years
old.  A pre-disposition report prepared in 1984 when he faced the charges of
gross indecency suggests that this experience severely traumatized S.H.M. and
may have contributed to the acts which gave rise to his conviction.   S.H.M.
left home at a relatively early age, although there is some dispute between the
appellant and his mother as to exactly when he did leave;  he claims he was
thrown out when he was 11 years old, while she states that he left of his own
volition when he was 15.   Part of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate
history of his early years stems from his having a ""tendency to deceit or
exaggeration"" related to attempts to gain sympathy.  S.H.M.'s
pre-disposition report quotes his mother as stating that S.H.M. is no longer
welcome in the family home and she is not prepared to support him emotionally
or financially in the future.

 

    S.H.M.
has been the subject of several studies and reports by psychiatrists, social
workers and psychologists.   The general picture that emerges is that of an
extremely self-conscious, insecure young man.   Laycraft C.J.A. in the
Alberta Court of Appeal described him thus:  ""He is shy, introverted, self
conscious, easily hurt and perceives himself to be isolated and disliked by his
teachers and his peers"".    He has also been described as
""passive"", and ""more a follower than a leader"".   Testing
reveals his IQ to be at 84 which is ""low average"" or ""dull
normal"".    While his physical age at the time of the offence was almost
eighteen, emotionally he is described as being thirteen or fourteen.    The
report prepared by the defence psychiatrist found that S.H.M. had a
""predominantly neurotic personality, having feelings of inferiority, being
insecure and unassertive, and hiding his feelings"";  he is also seen as
""pessimistic and possibly suicidal"".   A social history prepared by
the Edmonton John Howard Society stated that adult prison ""will be
destructive for this young person"" and that ""[t]he combination of his
immaturity, sexual identity confusion, and exaggerated need for approval by
others will be disastrous for him in the prison culture"".

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

    The Young
Offenders Act specifies that a young person charged with a criminal
offence is to be tried in Youth Court, rather than in ordinary court in
accordance with the law applicable to an adult offender.  The procedures in
Youth Court differ from those in ordinary court in a number of respects.  They
are less formal, and are before a judge alone rather than before judge and
jury.  Moreover, the consequences of conviction in Youth Court are also much
less severe than in ordinary court; the minimum disposition under the Criminal
Code  for the offence of first degree murder is life
imprisonment in a federal penitentiary without eligibility for parole for 25
years, while the maximum disposition under the Young Offenders Act  for any
offence, including first degree murder, is three years in a youth detention
centre.

 

    The Young
Offenders Act provides that in appropriate circumstances a young
person may be transferred from Youth Court to ordinary court and tried in
accordance with the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with the
offence.  Section 16(1)  and (2)  sets out the factors which the Youth Court judge
shall consider in deciding whether or not to transfer a youth to adult court. 
These subsections provide:

 

    16. (1) At any time after an information
is laid against a young person alleged to have, after attaining the age of
fourteen years, committed an indictable offence other than an offence referred
to in section 483  of the Criminal Code  but prior to
adjudication, a youth court may, on application of the young person or his
counsel, or the Attorney General or his agent, after affording both parties and
the parents of the young person an opportunity to be heard, if the court is of
the opinion that, in the interest of society and having regard to the needs of
the young person, the young person should be proceeded against in ordinary
court, order that the young person be so proceeded against in accordance with
the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with the offence.

 

    (2)  In considering an application under subsection
(1) in respect of a young person, a youth court shall take into account

 

(a) the seriousness of the alleged offence and the
circumstances in which it was allegedly committed;

 

(b) the age, maturity, character and background of the
young person and any record or summary of previous findings of delinquency
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act [c. J-3 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970] or previous findings of guilt under this or
any other Act of Parliament or any regulation made thereunder;

 

(c) the adequacy of this Act, and the adequacy of the Criminal
Code  or other Act of Parliament that would apply in respect
of the young person if an order were made under subsection (1), to meet the
circumstances of the case;

 

(d) the availability of treatment or correctional
resources;

 

(e) any representations made to the court by or on behalf
of the young person or by the Attorney General or his agent; and 

 

(f) any
other factors that the court considers relevant.

 

    In
addition to considering the factors enumerated in s. 16 , s. 3(2)  of the Young
Offenders Act requires that the Youth Court judge also consider the
principles set out in s. 3(1)  in deciding whether or not to transfer a youth to
ordinary court.  Section 3  provides:

 

3. (1) It is hereby recognized and declared that

 

(a) while young persons should not in all instances be
held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their
behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear
responsibility for their contraventions;

 

(b) society must, although it has the responsibility to
take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be
afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;

 

(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision,
discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of
development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and
assistance;

 

(d) where it is not inconsistent with the protection of
society, taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings
under this Act should be considered for dealing with young persons who have
committed offences;

 

(e) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own
right, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  or in the Canadian Bill of Rights, and in
particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to participate in, the
processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons should
have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;

 

(f) in the application of this Act, the rights and
freedoms of young persons include a right to the least possible interference
with freedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard
to the needs of young persons and the interests of their families;

 

(g) young persons have the right, in every instance where
they have rights or freedoms that may be affected by this Act, to be informed
as to what those rights and freedoms are; and

 

(h) parents have responsibility for the care and
supervision of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be
removed from parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures
that provide for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate.

 

    (2)
This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be dealt
with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

 

    Section
16 of the Act provides for review of the decision of the Youth Court judge; s.
16(9) provides for an appeal as of right to a judge of the provincial superior
court; and s. 16(10) provides that the decision of the superior court may in
turn be reviewed, with leave, by the Court of Appeal of the province.  In each
case the reviewing court is empowered not only to review the decision in
question but to confirm or reverse it in its discretion.  Section 16(9) and
(10) reads as follows:

 

    (9) Subject to subsection (11), an order made in
respect of a young person under subsection (1) or a refusal to make such an
order shall, on application of the young person or his counsel or the Attorney
General or his agent made within thirty days after the decision of the youth
court, be reviewed by the superior court and that court may, in its discretion,
confirm or reverse the decision of the youth court.

 

    (10)
A decision made in respect of a young person by a superior court under
subsection (9) may, on application of the young person or his counsel or the
Attorney General or his agent made within thirty days after the decision of the
superior court, with the leave of the court of appeal, by reviewed by that
court, and the court of appeal may, in its discretion, confirm or reverse the
decision of the superior court.

 

The Act
makes no provision for the exercise of an independent discretion by this
Court.  In the absence of a special statutory jurisdiction, the usual rules
governing this Court's interference with the exercise of judicial discretion by
intermediate appellate courts apply.   Interference with the exercise of such
discretion is premised on error of law or jurisdiction in the court below.  
Moreover, this Court will interfere with the exercise of discretion by an
intermediate court of appeal only ""on those rare occasions when it
perceives legal principles of national, and more particularly constitutional,
significance to be at stake"":  MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986]
1 S.C.R. 460, at p. 510, per Wilson J. (in dissent, but not on this point).   If
these requirements are not met, this Court will not interfere with the exercise
of judicial discretion conferred by statute on the court from which the appeal
is brought.   Thus, the scope for review by this Court is narrow.

 

Judgments

 

    It
is necessary to examine the decisions of the Youth Court judge and the justice
of the Queen's Bench who reviewed that decision in some detail, in order to put
in proper perspective the decision of the Court of Appeal which is under
appeal.

 

Youth
Court:  Judge Gerhart

 

    The
Youth Court judge stated that in considering whether or not to transfer the
appellant to adult court under s. 16(1) he was to take into consideration:  the
factors listed in s. 16(2)  of the Young Offenders Act;  the
principles set out in s. 3 ; and a pre-disposition report pursuant to s. 16(3) .

 

    Relying
on the Crown assertions, the Youth Court judge stated that the
""seriousness of the alleged offences and the circumstances alleged
surrounding their commission, without more, would seem to weigh in favor of a
transfer"".  In his opinion, however, other factors indicated a contrary
conclusion: ""[o]n the whole, the evidence submitted with respect to the
age, maturity, character, background, and record of the young person have not
persuaded the Court that it is essential that S.H.M. be transferred to adult
court"".    He stated that there was no evidence before the court with
respect to the necessity for confinement for treatment longer than available
under the Young Offenders Act, and that S.H.M.
would be adequately treated in either the young offender or adult systems.

 

    Having
considered the factors relevant to determining if a transfer should be made,
the Youth Court judge turned to the question of the onus upon the Crown to
justify the transfer of the appellant from Youth Court to adult court.  He
concluded that there was a ""heavy onus"" on the Crown to establish why
a transfer should be granted.  In the result, he dismissed the application.

 

Alberta
Court of Queen's Bench:  Miller A.C.J.

 

    Miller
A.C.J. felt that the Provincial Court judge had canvassed the relevant
considerations, and had addressed his mind to the appropriate legal
principles.  He detected no error of law and concluded that the Provincial
Court judge had properly exercised his discretion.   He confirmed the decision
of the Youth Court judge.

 

Alberta
Court of Appeal: Laycraft C.J.A., Hetherington and Irving JJ.A.

 

    Laycraft
C.J.A. delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, reversing the decision below
and ordering that the charges be transferred to ordinary court: (1987), 78 A.R.
309.  He reviewed the salient provisions of the Young Offenders Act and
noted that the legislation was designed to balance the interests of society
with the interests of the young offender, which often conflict.

 

    Laycraft
C.J.A. rejected the Youth Court judge's conclusion that there is a heavy onus
on the applicant seeking an order for transfer to ordinary court (at p. 316):

 

    In
my view it is not useful (and, indeed, not correct) to consider these basic
conflicts in terms of onus as did Judge Gerhart.  Unless a transfer order is
made the case will remain in Youth Court; in this sense the Crown, which seeks
to change the status quo, will not succeed unless it persuades the court that
the balancing of the factors favours transfer.  But I respectfully disagree
with Judge Gerhart's view that the Crown was required ""to discharge a
heavy onus"" or that it was helpful to consider whether the transfer order
was ""essential"".  That term connotes some sort of emergency to which
a transfer to adult court was the only possible answer.

 

    Laycraft
C.J.A. was also of the opinion that the Queen's Bench judge had erred in
concluding that the appeal should be dismissed because the Provincial Court
judge had applied the proper principles.  In his opinion, the provincial
appellate court under s. 16(9) and (10) must apply its own discretion in
reviewing the circumstances of the case.   He stated (at p. 316):

 

    Sections
16(9) and 16(10), in my opinion, establish different rules for the appellate
tribunal than would usually apply.  In each case the proceeding is a review
rather than an appeal and in each case the appellate tribunal is specifically
empowered ""in its discretion"" to confirm or reverse the decision
brought before it.  Each appellate tribunal has a new discretion to exercise. 
Of course, the appellate tribunals do not hear the evidence, de novo, and the
usual rules will apply to pay deference to the advantage enjoyed by the trial
judge in seeing and hearing the witnesses.  I respectfully disagree, however,
with the approach that this case could be answered, on the review in Court of
Queen's Bench, by determining whether the Youth Court Judge had correctly
stated the principles or the governing sections to be applied.  The appellate
judge had, himself, to exercise a discretion.

 

    Turning
to the factors required to be considered under s. 16 and s. 3 of the Act,
Laycraft C.J.A. stated (at p. 316):

 

    The ""interest of society"" to which the
section refers includes the protection of society, itself, from the offender,
as well as the enforcement of the standard of penalty which Parliament has seen
fit to fix for first degree murder.  That crime attracts the most serious
sanction in our criminal law.  The sanction sets forth the reaction of Canadian
society to the crime, as seen by the enactment of its elected representatives. 
By contrast the three year maximum penalty prescribed by the Young Offenders
Act may be seen, in some cases, as an absurdly inadequate response.

 

    Nevertheless
the needs of the young person must also be weighed in this balance.  To a
greater or lesser degree, depending on age and maturity, the young person is,
as s. 3(d) [sic] reminds us, in a state of dependency and has special
needs which require guidance and assistance and (as stated in s. 3(f)) the
least possible interference with his freedom.  In addition, s. 16(2)
specifically commands the court to take into account the adequacy of the Young
Offender's Act, or of the Criminal Code  to deal with the young
person in the circumstances of the case.  Each of the other factors mentioned
in s. 16  and in s. 3  must similarly be put in the balance.

 

    Laycraft
C.J.A. concluded with an acknowledgment of the difficulties inherent in the
question of transfer (at p. 316):

 

    In
the end the question, easy to state but profoundly difficult to answer is: do
all of the circumstances considered, taking into account the declarations of
principle in s. 3 and the factors in s. 16, bring the court to the
conclusion that it is in the interests of society, having regard to the needs
of the young person, to make the transfer?

 

Having
reviewed the relevant factors and considerations, Laycraft C.J.A. concluded that
it was in ""the interests of society, having regard to the needs of
S.H.M."" (p. 317), that the youth be transferred to ordinary court. 

 

Issues

 

    This
appeal raises three issues.   The first concerns the burden, if any, which the
Crown must discharge to permit an order for transfer.     The second concerns
the nature of the review process prescribed by the Act  -- namely, whether a
court of review under s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act is confined to correction of
error, or whether it exercises an independent discretion in deciding the
question of transfer.    The third issue is whether the Court of Appeal failed
to properly apply the test for transfer established by s. 16 and s. 3 of the
Act.

 

    I
propose to consider each question in turn.

 

Discussion

 

1.  The
Burden or Onus on the Applicant

 

    Two
questions are subsumed in this issue.  The first question is whether the
decision process under s. l6 is merely one of balancing the different factors
listed in s. 16(2), or whether there is a burden on the applicant (usually the
Crown) to establish that the transfer should be made?   If the applicant must
discharge such a burden, the second question arises as to the standard of
proof, to be discharged.  Is it the criminal standard, the civil standard, or
some other variant?

 

    The
Youth Court judge held that the Crown bore the burden of establishing that the
youth should be transferred to ordinary court, and that the onus was a heavy
one.    The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, took the view that it is
neither useful nor correct to consider the matter in terms of onus.   However,
having so stated, Laycraft C.J.A. went on to assert that the Crown, which seeks
to change the status quo, will not succeed unless it persuades the court that
the balancing of factors favours transfer.

 

    I
share the view that application of the concepts of burden and onus to the
transfer provisions of the Young Offenders Act may not be helpful. 
The question is basically one of statutory interpretation.   Parliament has
declared that unless otherwise ordered, young offenders will be tried in Youth
Court.   That is the status quo.   The party seeking transfer to ordinary court
must persuade the court that, having regard to the factors set out in s. 16(2)
and (3) of the Act, the case should be transferred.   In this sense there is a
burden on the party seeking transfer.

 

    What
then is the standard of proof which the applicant must meet?   The Court of
Appeal rejected the view of the judge below that there was a ""heavy
onus"" on the party seeking transfer.   I agree that it would be wrong as a
matter of law to say that the applicant must meet a heavy onus.   That term
carries with it the connotation that only in exceptional or very clear cases
should an order for transfer be made.    But Parliament did not say that. 
Parliament set out in detail the factors which must be weighed and balanced,
and stipulated that if after considering them the court was satisfied that it
was in the interests of society and the needs of the young person that he or
she should be transferred, the order should be made.   The requirement of the
French version of s. 16 that the transfer to adult court ""s'impose"",
while arguably stricter than the wording of the English version, does not, when
read together with the English text, support the view that transfer must be
confined to exceptional cases.   Rather, it is consistent with the conclusion
that transfer must appear as the right or proper solution.    This language
does not require that the case for transfer be exceptional or unusually
clear.   On the contrary, it has been pointed out that the language in the 1982
Act appears less stringent in terms of proof for transfer than under the
previous Act:  M. M. Bowker, ""Waiver of Juveniles to Adult Court
Under the Juvenile Delinquents Act:  Applicability of Principles to Young
Offenders Act"" (1987), 29 Crim. L.Q. 368, at pp.
379-80.    Parliament having failed to so stipulate that the case for transfer
must be ""exceptional"", or ""clear"" or necessary"", it is
not for this Court to do so.  That is not to say that the transfer of a case
from Youth Court to ordinary court is not a matter of the utmost seriousness.   
The declaration of principle in s. 3 of the Act, the emphasis throughout the
Act on the interests of the young person and the need to foster rehabilitation,
the establishment of a separate corrections system for young offenders -- all
these speak unmistakably of Parliament's awareness of the special needs and
considerations appropriate to young offenders.    But at the same time,
Parliament has recognized that in some cases, young offenders should be tried
in ordinary court.   The judge charged with the task of making this decision
must consider the factors set out in s. 16(1)  and (2)  in the context of the
philosophy of the Act toward young offenders to the end of determining whether
the applicant has satisfied him that a transfer should be ordered.   The task,
involving as it does the balancing of conflicting factors, is not easy. But it
will not be rendered lighter, in my opinion, by imposing on the scheme set out
in the Act an overlay of concepts such as ""heavy onus"" or ""very
heavy onus"".

 

    Nor
do I find it helpful to cast the issue in terms of a civil or criminal standard
of proof.   Those concepts are typically concerned with establishing whether
something took place.   It makes sense to speak of negligence being established
""on a balance of probabilities"", or to talk of the commission of a
crime being proved ""beyond a reasonable doubt"".    But it is less
helpful to ask oneself whether a young person should be tried in ordinary court
""on a balance of probabilities"".    One is not talking about something
which is probable or improbable when one enters into the exercise of balancing
the factors and considerations set out in s. 16(1)  and (2)  of the Young
Offenders Act.   The question rather is whether one is satisfied,
after weighing and balancing all the relevant considerations, that the case
should be transferred to ordinary court.

 

    In
my opinion, the Court of Appeal did not err in the view it took of the nature
of the burden on the Crown in this case.

 

2. The Nature
of the Review Process

 

    The
Act empowers the superior court of the province to review the decision of the
Youth Court judge and, ""in its discretion"" confirm or reverse it.  
The Court of Appeal has the same mandate in reviewing the decision of the
superior court judge.

 

    The
Court of Queen's Bench judge took a narrow view of his role.   In the judge's
opinion, he was not entitled to substitute his discretion for that of the Youth
Court judge.   He concluded he should not reverse the Youth Court judge's order
except on grounds of jurisdiction or error of law.

 

    The
Alberta Court of Appeal took a different view, stating that it is not enough to
ask whether error has been made;  the review court, in its opinion, ""has a
new discretion to exercise"".    Laycraft C.J.A. qualified this statement
by acknowledging that the review is not a trial de novo and
that the reviewing judge must pay deference to the advantage enjoyed by the
Youth Court judge in seeing and hearing the witnesses.

 

    I
agree with the view taken by the Court of Appeal.   Section 16(9) and (10), by
conferring on the reviewing court the ""discretion"" to confirm or
reverse, establishes different rules for the review than normally apply on
appeals, where the court is limited to correction of error.   The reviewing
body's function must be to ""review"" the decision, and then, ""in
its discretion"", confirm or reverse it.   This involves evaluation, not
only of whether the court below made an error of law or jurisdiction, but of
whether its conclusions are correct based on the factors set out in the Act. 
In short, the reviewing tribunal can go into the merits of the application.  If
this review leads to the conclusion that the decision below was wrong for any
of these reasons, the reviewing court in the exercise of its discretion may
substitute its own view for that of the judge below.

 

    There
is, however, an important limit on the power of the review tribunal.   Because
it has not heard the evidence, it must accept the Youth Court's findings of
fact and defer to it in matters involving the credibility of witnesses.   Parliament
has conferred on the review court a discretion to confirm or reverse the Youth
Court judge's decision, but it has left the task of hearing and evaluating the
evidence entirely to the Youth Court judge.    As Laycraft C.J.A. pointed out,
it is a fundamental rule that review tribunals which have not had the advantage
of hearing and seeing the witnesses should defer to the trial judge who has had
this advantage.   Nothing in the Act suggests that Parliament intended to
abridge this long-standing and eminently reasonable principle.

 

    The
appellant argues that it cannot have been the intention of Parliament to
encourage appeals by giving the reviewing courts an independent discretion.  
The first difficulty with this submission is that it runs counter to the
wording of the Act, which plainly confers an independent discretion on the
reviewing courts.    The second difficulty is that it is by no means
self-evident that Parliament could not have intended to confer a broad right of
appeal, including the exercise of new discretion, on the courts of review.  
The transfer of a young person to ordinary court is a serious matter, both from
the point of view of the alleged offender and of society.   The decision is one
of great imprecision and difficulty, involving as it does the balancing of
conflicting considerations.   It is entirely consistent with these concerns
that Parliament give the reviewing court the power to interfere, not only when
error of law can be found, but when it concludes that a proper weighing of the
relevant factors leads to a different conclusion.

 

    In
summary, it is my conclusion that the review court must base its review on the
facts found by the Youth Court judge and give due deference to the Youth Court
judge's evaluation of the evidence.   It must then proceed to apply the factors
set out in s. 16(2) to that evidence.   In applying these factors, the review
court is not confined to asking whether the Youth Court judge has erred, but
should make an independent evaluation on the basis of the facts found by the
Youth Court judge.   The result of that evaluation will be either to confirm or
to reverse the Youth Court's decision.

 

    In
my opinion, the Court of Appeal did not err in its conclusion that the Act
conferred on it the discretion to independently evaluate whether a transfer
should be made.

 

3.   Whether
the Court of Appeal Erred in Application of the Relevant Factors 

    The
appellant submits that the court erred in its application of the factors
relevant to transfer from Youth Court to ordinary court under the Young
Offenders Act.

 

    He
contends that in considering what is ""in the interests of society""
under the Act, the Court of Appeal placed too much emphasis on the need to
protect the public by securing the lengthy incarceration of those who commit
heinous crimes, and too little emphasis on the public interest in the
rehabilitation of the young person.   He submits that, having stated the
relevant considerations, the Court of Appeal went on to focus unduly on the age
of the appellant (almost adult), the seriousness of the offence, and the
perceived inadequacy of the maximum sentence under the Young
Offenders Act.  The appellant argues that the Court of Appeal was
more concerned with the inadequacy of the penalty under the Young
Offenders Act  than with the adequacy of the youth versus the adult
system in light of all the factors set out in the Act.

 

    The
reasons of the Court of Appeal support the suggestion that the court considered
the seriousness of the offence to be an important factor.   The age of the
accused and the inappropriateness of a three-year sentence, given the heinous
nature of the alleged crimes, also bulked large in its deliberations.   But the
reasons also demonstrate that the court properly bore in mind all the factors which
must be considered under s. 16.   Under the Act, the Court of Appeal was
required to review the decision below, independently balance the factors
prescribed by the Act, and, in the exercise of its discretion, make a
determination.    It did precisely that.

 

    I am
not satisfied that the Court of Appeal erred either in its statement of the
relevant factors or its application of them.   It is inevitable that in the
course of the review, some factors will assume greater importance than others,
depending on the nature of the case and the viewpoint of the tribunal in
question.   The Act does not require that all factors be given equal weight,
but only that each be considered.

 

    It
must be borne in mind that this Court has no power to substitute its discretion
for that of the court below.   The Young Offenders Act confers
no independent discretion on this Court;  our jurisdiction is limited to
correction of error in the proceedings below.   For this reason, it would be
inappropriate for this Court to enter on the question of whether it would have
decided the matter differently had the Act granted to it an independent
discretion.

 

     I
am not persuaded that the Court of Appeal erred in the application of the
relevant factors in the case on appeal.

 

Conclusion

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
reasons of La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- Having had the benefit of reading the opinion of my colleague,
Justice McLachlin, with deference, I am unable to subscribe to her conclusions
with respect to any of the three points in issue, nor can I agree with her
disposition of this appeal.

 

    All
the issues raised here involve the interpretation of the provisions of the Young
Offenders Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 110.  That legislation gives
expression to certain values which, to be fully appreciated, must in my view be
considered in light of the history of the Act which dates back to the turn of
the century.

 

    Parliament's
legislative commitment to the separate treatment of young offenders first
appeared in An Act respecting Arrest, Trial and Imprisonment of
Youthful Offenders, S.C. 1894, c. 58.  This commitment is evident in the
words of the preamble, the relevant part of which stated:

 

WHEREAS
it is desirable to make provision for the separation of youthful offenders from
contact with older offenders and habitual criminals during their arrest and
trial, and to make better provision than now exists for their commitment to
places where they may be reformed and trained to useful lives, instead of their
being imprisoned . . . .

 

    Provisions
were made by s. 2 for the separate treatment of persons aged under sixteen
involved in the criminal process:

 

    2. Young persons apparently under the
age of sixteen years who are: --

 

    (a.) arrested upon any warrant; or

 

    (b.) committed to custody at any stage of a preliminary
enquiry into a charge for an indictable offence; or

 

    (c.) committed to custody at any stage of a trial, either
for an indictable offence or for an offence punishable on summary conviction;
or

 

    (d.) committed to custody after such trial, but before
imprisonment under sentence, -- 

 

    shall
be kept in custody separate from older persons charged with criminal offences
and separate from all persons undergoing sentences of imprisonment, and shall
not be confined in the lock-ups or police stations with older persons charged
with criminal offences or with ordinary criminals.

 

    These
mandatory provisions covered the criminal process in its entirety, save for one
notable exception: sentencing.  Under s. 3 of the Act, where any child
""appearing . . . to be under the age of fourteen years"" was convicted
of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction, the
court ""instead of sentencing the child to any imprisonment provided by law
in such case, may order that the child shall be committed to the charge
of any home for destitute and neglected children"".  [Emphasis added.] 
There was at that time no statutory duty not to sentence youths to adult
prisons.

 

    The
1894 Act re-enacted s. 550 of the then Criminal Code  and
modified it to exclude youths from the ""adult"" criminal trial
process:

 

    550. The
trials of young persons apparently under the age of sixteen years, shall take
place without publicity and separately and apart from the trials of other
accused persons, and at suitable times to be designated and appointed for that
purpose.

 

    The
law remained substantially the same through the turn of the century.  The Prisons
and Reformatories Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 148, adopted the 1894 legislation in
great part.  The age where it became possible (but still not mandatory) to
sentence a youth to a special home was raised to sixteen.

 

    The
first legislation providing for the establishment of youth courts and a
mandatory sentencing to special rehabilitative homes for youthful offenders
appeared in The Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1908, S.C.
1908, c. 40.  The preamble of that legislation paralleled the preamble of the
1894 statute and read as follows:

 

WHEREAS
it is inexpedient that youthful offenders should be classed or dealt with as
ordinary criminals, the welfare of the community demanding that they should
on the contrary be guarded against association with crime and criminals, and
should be subjected to such wise care, treatment and control as will tend to
check their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better instincts . . .
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
objectives of treatment and rehabilitation are further apparent from the
following interpretation provision:

 

    31. This
Act shall be liberally construed to the end that its purpose may be carried
out, to wit: That the care and custody and discipline of a juvenile delinquent
shall approximate as nearly as may be that which should be given by its
parents, and that as far as practicable every juvenile delinquent shall be
treated, not as a criminal, but as a misdirected and misguided child, and one
needing aid, encouragement, help and assistance.

 

    Parliament's
enduring commitment to the separate treatment of juvenile offenders was
furthered by the establishment of juvenile courts as  courts of original
jurisdiction for the processing of young offenders.  The 1908 legislation also
provided for the procedure of summary trial which is still in essence used
today.  While the Juvenile Court had exclusive jurisdiction in respect of
offences committed by youths, a transfer to the ""adult"" system was
possible in exceptional circumstances:

 

    22. No juvenile delinquent shall, under
any circumstances, upon or after conviction, be sentenced to or incarcerated in
any penitentiary, or county or other jail, or police station, or any other
place in which adults are or may be imprisoned.

 

    2. This section shall not apply to a child who has
been proceeded against under the provisions of section 7 of this Act.

 

    7. Where
the act complained of is, under the provisions of The Criminal Code  or
otherwise, an indictable offence, and the accused child is apparently or
actually over the age of fourteen years, the court [i.e., the Juvenile Court]
may, in its discretion, order the child to be proceeded against by indictment
in the ordinary courts in accordance with the provisions of The
Criminal Code  in that behalf; but such course shall in no case be
followed unless the court is of the opinion that the good of the child and the
interest of the community demand it.  The court may, in its discretion, at
any time before any proceeding has been initiated against the child in the
ordinary criminal courts, rescind an order so made.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    I
note parenthetically that the ""interest of the community"" referred to
in s. 7 and the ""welfare of the community"", referred to in the
preamble, appear to be corresponding expressions.  In the preamble, the
expression ""welfare of the community"" is described as encompassing
society's interest in the reformation of youthful offenders.  The
""interest of the community"" would appear to comprise that reformatory
or rehabilitative interest as well.

 

    The Juvenile
Delinquents Act, 1908 applied to any boy or girl apparently or actually under
the age of sixteen years.

 

    The
1908 legislation provided for no specific right of appeal against a transfer
hearing decision.  Rather, as set out in the second sentence of s. 7, the
Juvenile Court judge retained jurisdiction to rescind the previous order. 
However, in 1929 (The Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1929, S.C.
1929, c. 46), such decision fell under the general right of appeal provided in
s. 37:

 

    37. (1) A Supreme Court judge may, in his
discretion, on special grounds, grant special leave to appeal from any decision
of the Juvenile Court . . . .

 

    (2)
No leave to appeal shall be granted under the provisions of this section unless
the judge or court granting such leave considers that in the particular
circumstances of the case it is essential in the public interest or for the due
administration of justice that such leave be granted.

 

    Sections
22 and 31 of the 1908 legislation remained unaltered through the 1927 revision
(R.S.C. 1927, c. 108), except that they were renumbered 23 and 33,
respectively.  Likewise, the provisions remained substantially the same through
the re-enactment of the legislation as The Juvenile
Delinquents Act, 1929.  In that re-enactment, old ss. 7, 23 and 33 were
renumbered 9, 26 and 38, respectively.  The transfer provision (s. 9), the
separate treatment provision (s. 26) and the interpretation clause (s. 38) remained
untouched through 1952 (R.S.C. 1952, c. 160), and through 1970 (R.S.C. 1970, c.
J-3).  Thus, the dispositions of the 1908 legislation survived for nearly 75
years, until the current legislation, the Young Offenders Act, was
enacted on July 7, 1982 and proclaimed in force on April 2, 1984.

 

    The
1982 Act increased the age of young persons covered by the legislation to apply
to persons who are, or, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, appear to
be, under eighteen years of age, in a province where no proclamation has
specified an age of sixteen or seventeen (s. 2(1)).  Another modification
concerned the interpretation clause, originally found in s. 31 of The
Juvenile Delinquents Act, 1908, which was substantially broadened by
the addition of a statement of policy objectives:

 

3. (1) It is hereby recognized and declared that

 

(a) while young persons should not in all instances be
held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their
behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear
responsibility for their contraventions;

 

(b) society must, although it has the responsibility to
take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be
afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;

 

(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision,
discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of
development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and
assistance;

 

(d) where it is not inconsistent with the protection of
society, taking no measures or taking measures other than judicial proceedings
under this Act should be considered for dealing with young persons who have
committed offences;

 

                                                                          .
. . 

 

    (2)
This Act shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be
dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).

 

    The
legislation adopted in 1982 maintains the exclusive jurisdiction of the Youth
Court as a general rule with the exceptional possibility of a transfer to the
ordinary courts.  The test to be applied by the Youth Court judge was slightly
redrafted and specific criteria, absent from the previous enactment, were set
out in the new transfer provisions:

 

    16. (1) At any time after an information
is laid against a young person alleged to have, after attaining the age of
fourteen years, committed an indictable offence other than an offence referred
to in section 483  of the Criminal Code  [offences for
which the jurisdiction of Provincial Court judges is absolute] but prior to
adjudication, a youth court may, on application of the young person or his
counsel, or the Attorney General or his agent, after affording both parties and
the parents of the young person an opportunity to be heard, if the court is of
the opinion that, in the interest of society and having regard to the needs of
the young person, the young person should be proceeded against in ordinary
court, order that the young person be so proceeded against in accordance with
the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with the offence.

 

    (2) In considering an application under subsection
(1) in respect of a young person, a youth court shall take into account 

 

(a) the seriousness of the alleged offence and the
circumstances in which it was allegedly committed;

 

(b) the age, maturity, character and background of the
young person and any record or summary of previous findings of delinquency
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act or previous
findings of guilt under this or any other Act of Parliament or any regulation
made thereunder;

 

(c) the adequacy of this Act, and the adequacy of the Criminal
Code  or other Act of Parliament that would apply in respect
of the young person if an order were made under subsection (1), to meet the
circumstances of the case;

 

(d) the availability of treatment or correctional
resources;

 

(e) any representations made to the court by or on behalf
of the young person or by the Attorney General or his agent; and

 

(f) any
other factors that the court considers relevant.

 

    That
Act, in addition, makes specific allowance for the review of transfer hearing
decisions and sets the standard of review in the following provisions: 

    16 ...

 

    (9) Subject to subsection (11), an order made in
respect of a young person under subsection (1) or a refusal to make such an
order shall, on application of the young person or his counsel or the Attorney
General or his agent made within thirty days after the decision of the youth
court, be reviewed by the superior court and that court may, in its discretion,
confirm or reverse the decision of the youth court.  

 

    (10)
A decision made in respect of a young person by a superior court under
subsection (9) may, on application of the young person or his counsel or the
Attorney General or his agent made within thirty days after the decision of the
superior court, with the leave of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that
court, and the court of appeal may, in its discretion, confirm or reverse the
decision of the superior court.  

 

    Those
two sections, ss. 3  and 16, which have not been amended since their enactment
in 1982, are at the heart of the present appeal.

 

    This
brief legislative history of the provisions of the Young Offenders Act amply
demonstrates that for nearly one hundred years Parliament has committed itself
to the separate treatment and rehabilitation of young persons involved in the
criminal process.  The underlying philosophy has been from the beginning that
it is in society's interest to assist young offenders ""to strengthen their
better instincts"".  An attempt is made through the legislation to
""prevent these juveniles to become prospective criminals and to assist
them to be law-abiding citizens"" (Attorney General of
British Columbia v. Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 702, at p. 710).  For the effective
pursuit of this general objective, Parliament and the legislatures have joined
in an effort to establish specialized tribunals and provide funding for facilities
such as detention centers and rehabilitation programs.  While in 1982 the
legislation was revised, the fundamental values remained and permeate the
provisions of the Act.

 

    This
brings me to the transfer provisions of the Act here in question.  The discussion
will focus on the three main issues:  the burden of proof, the scope of review
and the test for transfer.

 

I  -  Burden
of Proof

 

    Commenting
on the nature of transfer, in 1965, the Department of Justice Committee on
Juvenile Delinquency predicted:  ""Waiver is, and is likely to remain, an
exceptional procedure"" (Juvenile Delinquency in Canada, at p.
84).  This forecast rests on policy assumptions still appropriate today.  The
decision to release the youth to the ordinary criminal enforcement process
represents an abdication by the youth system of its exclusive jurisdiction to
deal with young offenders.  The immediate consequence of a decision to transfer
is to strip the youth of his entitlement to the special accommodations made by
the statute in its objective of treatment and care.  This is noted by M. M.
Bowker, a former Juvenile Court judge and respected authority in the field, in
""Waiver of Juveniles to Adult Court Under the Juvenile Delinquents Act: 
Applicability of Principles to Young Offenders Act"" (1987), 29 Crim. L.Q. 368. 
After emphasizing the rule, previously embodied in s. 4 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act and today expressed in s. 5  of the Young
Offenders Act , that the Youth Court is exclusively seized in respect
of offences alleged to have been committed by young persons, the author
explains (at p. 372):

 

    The
only exception to this general rule is contained in the waiver or transfer
provisions in the respective Acts.  Only in special circumstances are young
persons to be deprived of the benefits and protections to which they are
entitled under those Acts.  Such advantages include protection from publicity,
private trials, limited public access to court records and less stringent
penalties upon conviction.

 

Transfer
deprives the youths of their entitlement to the rehabilitative philosophy and
treatment resources of the system specially designed to meet their needs.  In
this sense, as was noted by the Supreme Court of the United States in Kent v.
United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), at p. 556:   ""the waiver of
jurisdiction is a """"critically important"" action determining
vitally important statutory rights of the juvenile"".

 

    The
exceptional nature of transfer was recognized in the drafting of the Young
Offenders Act.  According to the report prepared in 1975 by the
Solicitor General's Committee on Proposals for new legislation to replace the
Juvenile Delinquents Act (Young Persons in Conflict with the Law, at p.
38):  

 

    The
provision for transfer is based on the assumption that there are cases in which
the general intent of the Juvenile Delinquents Act must be overridden because
some aspect of the case demands an exception to the philosophy or practices of
the juvenile court.

 

    Because
treatment within the system is the rule, and transfer the exception, it follows
that the person applying for a transfer bears the burden of establishing that
the conditions of the transfer are made out.  This burden is laid out in s.
16(1).  The applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the Youth Court
that:

 

. . . in
the interest of society and having regard to the needs of the young person, the
young person should be proceeded against in the ordinary court . . . .
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
French text of that section seems to be more stringent: 

 

. . . le
tribunal pour adolescents peut [. . .] ordonner le renvoi de l'adolescent [. .
.] s'il estime que, dans l'intrêt de la société et compte tenu des besoins de
l'adolescent, le renvoi de la cause devant cette juridiction s'impose.
[Emphasis added.]  

 

    In
the previous Act, s. 9 specified that 

 

. . .
such course [transfer] shall in no case be followed unless the court is of the
opinion that the good of the child and the interest of the community demand
it. [Emphasis added.] 

 

The word
""demand"", taken in isolation, may appear to be a more exacting
standard than is indicated today by the word ""should"".  However, it
does not follow that the change in wording from s. 9 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act to s. 16(1)  of the Young Offenders Act
evidences an intention to relax the onus of persuasion to bear on the Youth
Court judge.  

 

    To
begin with, the French text of s. 9 of the previous Act read as follows:

 

. . .
cette mesure [transfer] ne doit être prise que lorsque la cour est d'avis que
le bien de l'enfant et l'interêt de la société l'exigent.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    Both
the words ""exigent"" in the previous Act and ""s'impose""
in the current legislation connote a strong sense of necessity.  They imply
that transfer is imperative, that it is the only possible solution.  In Le Grand
Robert de la langue française (1986), one finds the following
definitions:

 

[TRANSLATION]  REQUIRE . . . 1. 
Make a peremptory request . . . 2.  Render indispensable, unavoidable,
obligatory . . .

 

IMPOSE . . .
II. 1. . . . (c) BE UNAVOIDABLE . . . Have to be accepted, be
unable to be refused.  Choice, solution, necessity which is unavoidable.

 

Thus the
imperative nature of the French text in the previous Act was preserved in the
current legislation.

 

    In
addition, one must not lose sight of the other changes which were brought by s.
16.  Under the previous Act, there were no explicitly stated criteria for the
assessment of whether a transfer should be ordered.  The new Act of course
provides in s. 16(2) for a fairly detailed list of factors which the Youth
Court judge must now take into account.  The new Act directs the judge to
consider a pre-disposition report (s. 16(3)).  It also imposes a duty on the
judge to state the reasons for decision, which was not previously required (s.
16(5)).  In this context, the judge's discretion was much wider under the
previous legislation.  This is noted by Bowker, when she writes (loc. cit., at
pp. 379-80):

 

    The
wording under the new Act would appear less stringent in terms of proof than
was so under the former Act.  However, it would be inappropriate to assume that
under the new Act waiver is likely to be more frequent.  Such possibility is
balanced by new legal safeguards, provided in the new Act, by guidelines for
the court in reaching its opinion and the requirement that reasons be given by
the court for either granting or refusing an order of waiver.

 

    I
agree with these comments.  The new wording demands a burden just as strong as
did the previous wording.  Reading the French and the English texts together in
order to find a common interpretation in accord with Parliament's intent and
the basic philosophy of the legislation, including the exceptional nature of
transfers, and having regard to all the requirements in s. 16, I am of the view
that, under s. 16(1)  of the Young Offenders Act, the transfer of a
youth to the ordinary court must propose itself to the Youth Court judge's mind
as the only appropriate solution.

 

    In
the case at bar, the Youth Division application considered that the burden on
an applicant under s. 16(1) of the Act is a ""heavy"" one.  Gerhart
Prov. Ct. J. wrote:

 

    It
appears to the Court therefore that an application to waive a young person to
adult court is in the nature of an exception, and is not merely routine because
of the ""seriousness"" of the alleged offence.  If that be so, then the
onus on the Crown is not merely to demonstrate the ""seriousness"" of
the alleged offence, but also to bring evidence to demonstrate why, in the
particular case, a waiver is required.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    The
expression ""heavy onus"" does little to further the understanding of
the true scope of s. 16(1).  There is no need in my view to require the high
standard of proof applicable in criminal matters, but no reason either to
depart from the traditional civil standard of proof, that is, proof on the
balance of probabilities.  There are no ritualistic incantations or magical
formulas to describe the onus.  Whatever words are used, the burden falls
squarely on the applicant to persuade the Youth Court that no solution other
than transfer is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case.

 

    In
the Court of Appeal (1987), 78 A.R. 309, Laycraft C.J.A. rejected the notion
that the Crown was required to discharge a ""heavy onus"", saying that
""[t]hat term connotes some sort of emergency to which a transfer to adult
court was the only possible answer"" (p. 316).  Instead, Laycraft C.J.A.
preferred a lower threshold (at p. 316):

 

Unless a
transfer order is made the case will remain in Youth Court; in this sense the
Crown, which seeks to change the status quo, will not succeed unless it
persuades the court that the balancing of the factors favours transfer. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

In my
respectful view, that threshold is too low.  It pays insufficient heed to the
text of s. 16(1), particularly the French text and the additional requirements
in s. 16, both of which imply that transfer must be necessary or imperative. 
It also fails to take into account the legislative history of the Young
Offenders Act, the centennial commitment to the treatment of young
offenders in a special enforcement system and the exceptional nature of
transfer, which are all indicative of the intent of Parliament in adopting s.
16 .  This erroneous characterization by the Court of Appeal of an applicant's
onus did, in my view, pervade its assessment of the evidence relating to the
elements to be considered in s. 16 .

 

II  - Scope
of Review

 

The Courts
Below

 

    The
Court of Queen's Bench adopted a restrictive interpretation of the scope of
review allowed by s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act.  Miller A.C.J.Q.B. exercised
his discretion on the basis that no error had been committed by the Youth
Division judge, either in fact or in law.  He found that the Youth Division
judge's decision should stand:

 

I would
like to advise the accused and counsel, for the record, that in the interval
since the matter was argued, I have spent several hours reading the transcript
and the reports that were involved by the psychiatric experts.  I have again
read in detail the Reasons for Decision given by His Honour Judge Gerhart . . .
. Taking all of these matters into consideration as best I can, I have come to
the conclusion that the learned Provincial judge did not err in the conclusion
he came to.  He, as I earlier mentioned, canvassed all of the balancing factors
and the relevant principles, and I can find nowhere where he has erred in law.

 

    The
Court of Appeal of Alberta took a much broader approach to its powers of review
and found that s. 16(9) and (10) empowered it to reconsider the matter ab initio. 
Laycraft C.J.A. wrote (at p. 316):

 

    In
the end the question, easy to state but profoundly difficult to answer, is: do
all the circumstances considered, taking into account the declarations of
principle in s. 3 and the factors in s. 16, bring the court to the conclusion
that it is in the interests of society, having regard to the needs of the young
person, to make the transfer?

 

Laycraft
C.J.A. could hardly have formulated the question in that way had he envisioned
the court's reviewing function to be more restrictive than a full
reconsideration of the merits.  Indeed, Laycraft C.J.A. added (at p. 316):

 

    Sections
16(9) and 16(10), in my opinion, establish different rules for the appellate
tribunal than would usually apply.  In each case the proceeding is a review
rather than an appeal and in each case the appellate tribunal is specifically
empowered ""in its discretion"" to confirm or reverse the decision
brought before it.  Each appellate tribunal has a new discretion to exercise. 
Of course, the appellate tribunals do not hear the evidence de novo, and the
usual rules will apply to pay deference to the advantage enjoyed by the trial
judge in seeing and hearing the witnesses.  I respectfully disagree, however,
with the approach that this case could be answered, on the review in the Court
of Queen's Bench, by determining whether the Youth Court judge had correctly
stated the principles or the governing sections to be applied.  The appellate
judge had, himself, to exercise a discretion.

 

    Laycraft
C.J.A. then considered the case law and noted that while some decisions adopted
a more restrictive view of s. 16(9) and (10), others supported his
interpretation of these provisions.

 

The
Authorities

 

    Under
the previous Juvenile Delinquents Act, the case law was
settled to the effect that, upon an appeal launched under the auspices s. 37 of
the Act, the reviewing courts ""should only intervene if the lower court
has not considered all the relevant factors in making its decision and, in so
doing, has committed an error of law or in principle"" (P. Béliveau, J.
Bellemare and J.-P. Lussier, On Criminal Procedure (1982), at p.
124).  In R. v. Chamberlain (1974), 15 C.C.C.
(2d) 379, at p. 385, the Ontario Court of Appeal held:

 

A Judge
sitting in appeal in accordance with the provisions of s. 37 must first
determine if the provincial Judge who made the order had taken into account and
given weight to factors relevant to the determination of the issue as to what
order was for the good of the child and the interests of the community or had
considered and given effect to irrelevant matters.  The test to be applied is
not whether the Judge hearing the appeal would have exercised his discretion in
a similar or dissimilar manner had he been sitting as a Judge in the Court of
first instance.

 

This
decision was followed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Cole (1975),
25 C.C.C. (2d) 140, as well as by the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v.
Boisvert (No. 2) (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 362.  The Manitoba Court of
Appeal likewise adopted a policy of judicial deference upon appellate review. 
In R. v. Smith (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 368, at p. 371, delivering the
reasons of the majority of the court, Hall J.A. explained the policy as
follows:

 

    In the circumstances of this case, it is my opinion,
that the Justice on appeal erred in freely substituting his opinion for that of
the learned Provincial Judge.

 

    Any appellate tribunal should be slow indeed to
interfere with the exercise of the discretion conferred by the statute.

 

    In
the present case, the Judge of first instance saw and heard the witnesses;
moreover, he is intimately familiar with the process for disposing of
delinquencies.  As earlier mentioned, no demonstrable error is apparent from
the record.

 

    The
underpinning of this policy of deference has remained valid even since the
enactment of the Young Offenders Act.  However, the
restrictive approach to review previously adopted by the provincial courts of
appeal has not been followed with corresponding unanimity.

 

    Instances
of a restrictive approach are provided by R. v. R.M.C. (1987),
33 C.C.C. (3d) 136 (Man. C.A.), where Twaddle J.A. rested his interpretation on
the observation that the Young Offenders Act establishes a
two-tiered review.  He emphasized the fact that an appeal to the second tier
was only possible by leave and suggested that leave is more likely to be
granted, as a matter of practice, when there is an error in principle or some
overriding policy concern justifies the intervention of the Court of Appeal. 
He concluded (at p. 153):

 

    In
providing for review by this court with leave only, Parliament did not intend,
in my view, that leave should be given, merely because this court would have
reached, in its discretion, a different decision.  Leave should be given only
where: ""(i) there is a meritorious argument that the reviewing judge
applied a wrong principle or misapprehended the facts; or (ii) a point of law
which this court should decide is raised"".

 

Although
in R.M.C. Twaddle J.A. had in mind the second tier of the review
structure, and to this extent his comments contemplate a context different from
the present one, his words nevertheless indicate that the court is not prepared
to exercise its discretion to review in all cases.

 

    A
restrictive approach was likewise adopted by the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. N.B. (1985),
21 C.C.C. (3d) 374.  Beauregard J.A. stated (at p. 381):

 

    [TRANSLATION]  I am
therefore of the opinion that the Attorney General did not establish before
Bienvenue J. [a superior court judge] that Judge Choquette [of the Youth Court]
manifestly erred with respect to the facts, that she erred in law or that she
used her discretion in a non-judicial manner.  As a result, it was not
appropriate that her decision be reversed.

 

Likewise,
the other member of the majority, Rothman J.A. concluded his review as follows
(at p. 383):

 

    Although
there were certainly elements that weighed in favour of the transfer, there
were others, equally important, that weighed against it.  On the basis of the
material before her, I am of the opinion that the youth court judge was
entitled to come to the conclusion that she did and I can see no error in her
conclusion.

 

These
words are hardly an assertion of the reviewing court's unfettered discretion to
substitute its own assessment of the interests of society and the needs of the
youth in the place of the Youth Court.

 

    In R. v. A. (1986),
3 Q.A.C. 16, the Quebec Court of Appeal again underscored the need to find
error in the Youth Court's decision.  Following R. v. N.B., a
majority of the court expressed the view that (at pp. 19-20):

 

[TRANSLATION] [W]e
must consider whether in light of the facts in the case at bar the youth court
judge, as [the Crown] submitted, committed errors of law or fact or misused his
discretion and accordingly whether the superior court judge was right to
intervene.

 

    In R. v. W.Y.,
B.C.C.A., No. 008351, April 20, 1988 (summarized (1988), 4 W.C.B. (2d) 267),
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia adopted a similar position.  In
rendering judgment for the court, McLachlin J.A. (as she then was) stated (at
p. 5):

 

So there
is an additional discretion.  The discretion must be exercised judicially.  On
the other hand, the review is not a trial de novo and, generally speaking,
the Court of Appeal will not interfere unless it appears that the judge below
has misapprehended the facts or erred in applying the law.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    The
Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Trial Division, in R. v. S.J.H. (1986),
76 N.S.R. (2d) 163, also considered that the reviewing discretion could only be
exercised where the judge found (at p. 167) ""that the conclusion of the
learned [Youth Court] judge was clearly wrong, that is that he erred in
principle or misconstrued the evidence"".

 

    Other
decisions make room for a more liberal approach of the reviewing court's
discretion.  In R. v. M. (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 538, a
majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal emphasized that ""[a]ll three
levels of the judiciary . . . proceed in a discretionary manner"" (p.
540).  In R. v. M.A.Z. (1987), 35 C.C.C.
(3d) 144, leave to appeal to this Court refused, June 23, 1987, [1987] 1
S.C.R.. xii, the Ontario Court of Appeal likewise rejected the notion that the
youth court below has to be wrong in principle before the reviewing court is
entitled to exercise the discretion conferred by s. 16(9) and (10) of the Young
Offenders Act.  MacKinnon A.C.J.O., for the court, concluded that the
reviewing court had the obligation ""to review fully the evidence"" and
that the ""appeal court renders the decision that it concludes should have
been given"" (p. 160).  Under this approach the reviewing court appears to
be entitled to freely substitute its opinion for that of the lower court.

 

    A
middle-ground approach has emerged in the case law.  Under this approach, the
reviewing court has discretion to review the merits of the decision made by the
Youth Court judge, but such discretion is only to be exercised when the court
is of the view that the evidence discloses a serious ground for intervention. 
This approach is best exemplified by the unanimous judgment of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in R. v. J.R.D. (1988), 17 Q.A.C.
81.  Delivering the reasons for the court, LeBel J.A. conducted an extensive
review of the case law and legislation and concluded as follows (at p. 91):

 

    [TRANSLATION]  Unless the provisions inserted in
the Young Offenders Act are to be disregarded, it has to be admitted
that the legislator wished to confer additional power on the judges of the
Superior Court and appellate courts hearing appeals from transfer
applications.  He was not content with the usual restrictions in the ordinary
appeal machinery.  Appellate courts thus cannot simply ensure that the law is
properly applied and correct manifest errors in the assessment of facts.  In
each case of a transfer application, operating within certain limits inherent
in the function of an appellate court, in particular acting on the basis of the
facts as found by the trial judge in the youth court, an appellate court must
determine whether the evidence justifies the transfer application.  It will
then itself proceed to apply the criteria stated in s. 16(1) , (2)  and (3) 
and render a suitable judgment on the advisability of transfer.

 

    I
would however add one word of warning.  Some caution is necessary despite the
apparently wide extent of the powers conferred on an appellate court under
s. 16(10).  This caution proceeds from the function of an appellate court,
a court of general jurisdiction as compared with a specialized tribunal.  The
legislator intended that the treatment of young offenders by the courts should
in general be in the hands of courts with special qualifications based on their
expertise.  This means that the experience and competence possessed by such
courts should be viewed with respect by superior and appellate courts.  They
should only exercise their own discretion for good reason, in cases where there
is substantial disagreement with the way in which the trial judge has applied
the rules.  In my opinion minor discrepancies will not justify the intervention
of an appellate court, which it seems to me would then be going beyond even the
broad function which it is assigned by s. 16(10) of the Act. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

These
closing words suggest that the restriction on the exercise of the reviewing
discretion is more than a question of judicial policy; it is a matter of law. 
With this suggestion I agree.

 

Curial
Deference

 

    There
are two aspects of the statutory scheme set up by the Young
Offenders Act which in my view require a reviewing court acting under
the authority of s. 16(9) and (10) to pay curial deference to the Youth
Division's decision.

 

    First,
there is no allowance in the Act for the giving of evidence before the
reviewing court.  The review contemplated by the Act is not a de novo
hearing, as the Court of Appeal correctly noted in the present case.  Moreover,
unlike the case in a criminal trial pursuant to s. 609 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, no provision is made in the Young
Offenders Act for the transcription of the proceedings conducted by
the Youth Court judge, nor, of course, for the transmission of such
transcription to the reviewing court.  The Court of Queen's Bench and the Court
of Appeal, acting under the authority of s. 16(9) and (10) respectively, are
therefore not required by Parliament to proceed on the basis of the oral
evidence adduced at the transfer hearing.  In the absence of a transcript, the
reviewing courts must rely exclusively on the written evidence and the findings
of fact as recorded in the reasons of the Youth Court judge.  These
considerations seem to me to stress Parliament's intention to favour the usual
restraint with respect to the assessment of the credibility of witnesses and
the determination of facts made by the Youth Court judge.

 

    The
particularities of the Young Offenders Act compel in my view
an even greater restraint.  Since the applications for transfer are made before
the trial, much of the evidence adduced at the transfer hearing is in the
nature of hearsay.  It is not uncommon in transfer hearings for the
investigating officer to offer viva voce evidence reporting
statements of witnesses not present to testify in person, such as the medical
examiner and informants.  As a matter of practice, the usual rules of evidence
appear to be relaxed during transfer hearings.  In R. v. W.Y., supra,
McLachlin J.A., commenting on ""the more liberal rules governing material
admissible on transfer proceedings under the Young Offenders Act "" stated
(at p. 8):

 

Section
16 itself requires the court to have regard to material which is by its very
nature founded on hearsay when it requires that the transfer hearing judge
consider the pre-disposition report relevant to the accused.

 

Without
passing upon the legality of such a practice, as the issue is not raised in
this appeal, I would emphasize that the Youth Court's assessment of the
sincerity and credibility of witnesses is all the more crucial where the
witnesses are allowed to adduce evidence which may be eminently prejudicial to
the youth yet remains unchecked by the traditional safeguards of the law of
evidence.

 

    Second,
the Youth Court was established as a court of specialized jurisdiction to help
attain the objectives of the legislation.  As noted by this Court in Attorney
General of British Columbia v. Smith, supra, with
respect to the Juvenile Court, it is ""an enforcement process specially
adapted to the age and impressibility of juveniles and fundamentally different,
in pattern and purpose, from the one governing in the case of adults"" (p.
710).  That Parliament intended the Youth Court to differ from the ordinary
courts is evidenced by a distinction between the two courts imported in s. 2(1)
of the Act:

 

2. (1) In this Act,

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

""ordinary court"" means the court that would,
but for this Act, have jurisdiction in respect of an offence alleged to have
been committed;

 

                                                                          .
. .

 

""youth
court"" means a court established or designated by or under an Act of the
legislature of a province, or designated by the Governor in Council or the
Lieutenant Governor in Council of a province, as a youth court for the purposes
of this Act;

 

The
Youth Court is given exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the criminal
enforcement of charges laid against young persons: 

 

    5. (1)
Notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament but subject to the National
Defence Act  and section 16 , a youth court has exclusive
jurisdiction in respect of any offence alleged to have been committed by a
person while he was a young person and any such person shall be dealt with as
provided in this Act.

 

    As a
necessary consequence of this statutory scheme, Youth Court judges accumulate a
precious familiarity with the particular situation of youths involved in the
criminal system.  By virtue of their specialized jurisdiction, the judges are
in a better position to appreciate the scientific data and literature, the
statistics developed over the years with respect to similar cases, the
facilities available for the rehabilitation of young offenders and the
likelihood that the resources will satisfy the treatment and care objectives of
the legislation.  Parliament could not have been blind to the fact that the
creation of such a specialized tribunal would foster the emergence of a specially
skilled class of decision-makers.

 

    The
policy of deference to expert decision-makers is entrenched in the principles
of judicial review.  Commenting upon a privative clause ensuring the finality
and conclusiveness of the decisions of a provincial labour board, Dickson J.
(as he then was) noted (Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 963 v. New
Brunswick Liquor Corp., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227, at pp. 235-36):

 

The
rationale for protection of a labour board's decisions within jurisdiction is
straightforward and compelling.  The labour board is a specialized tribunal
which administers a comprehensive statute regulating labour relations.  In the
administration of that regime, a board is called upon not only to find facts
and decide questions of law, but also to exercise its understanding of the body
of jurisprudence that has developed around the collective bargaining system, as
understood in Canada, and its labour relations sense acquired from accumulated
experience in the area.

 

The
rationale for curial deference in judicial review compels with equal strength a
similar restraint in statutory review.  In determining the breadth of the right
to review conferred by statute, ""it is hardly practical for the court to
consider substituting its opinion where there is no written transcript of the
proceedings below, or where the tribunal's opinion is based upon purely
technical matters or upon familiarity with matters in respect of which the
court has no expertise"" (R. F. Reid and H. David,
Administrative Law and Practice (2nd ed. 1978), at p. 452).  While no
privative clause ensures the finality and conclusiveness of the Youth Court's
transfer dispositions, Parliament's intention to defer to the Youth Court's
expertise sufficiently underlies the statutory constitution of a specialized
tribunal vested with exclusive first instance jurisdiction.  In a recent
judgment, Bell Canada v. Canada (Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1722, this Court
noted the importance of the specialization of duties in appellate review in
matters lying at the heart of the administrative tribunal's expertise (at p.
1746):

 

    However,
within the context of a statutory appeal from an administrative tribunal,
additional consideration must be given to the principle of specialization of
duties.  Although an appeal tribunal has the right to disagree with the lower
tribunal on issues which fall within the scope of the statutory appeal, curial
deference should be given to the opinion of the lower tribunal on issues which
fall squarely within its area of expertise.

 

    The
elements which are relevant to the transfer hearing involve questions of fact. 
For instance, s. 16(2)(a) directs the judge to consider ""the seriousness of
the alleged offence and the circumstances in which it was allegedly
committed"".  The judge is also required to assess the ""age, maturity,
character and background of the young person"" (s. 16(2)(b)) as
well as the ""availability of treatment or correctional resources"" (s.
16(2)(d)).  The factors of the ""availability of
treatment"" (s. 16(2)(d)) and of the ""adequacy of this Act"" to meet
the circumstances of each case (s. 16(2)(c)) fall
squarely within the scope of the Youth Court judge's expertise.  In balancing
the factors set out in s. 16(2), the judge will inevitably assess the evidence
adduced before the court in light of this accumulated experience.  For
instance, the judge may be satisfied that the expert evidence establishes that
there are no treatment facilities suited for the young offender, or that the
offender has exhausted the resources of the system.  Courts of general
jurisdiction, who do not benefit from a transcript of the proceedings and do not
have the advantage of seeing or hearing the witnesses, are perhaps not as well
prepared as the specialized judges to make these assessments.  As a result, to
the extent that these elements are not rooted in any palpable or overriding
error they should be taken as definitively established by the Youth Court
judge.

 

    In
light of this background I now turn to the interpretation of the true scope of
s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act.

 

Section
16(9) and (10) of the Young Offenders Act

 

    For
the sake of convenience, I reproduce once again s. 16(9) and (10) of the Young
Offenders Act:

 

    (9) Subject to subsection (11), an order made
in respect of a young person under subsection (1) or a refusal to make such an
order shall, on application of the young person or his counsel or
the Attorney General or his agent made within thirty days after the decision of
the youth court, be reviewed by the superior court and that court may, in
its discretion, confirm or reverse the decision of the youth court.

 

    (9) Sous réserve du paragraphe (11), l'ordonnance
concernant un adolescent rendue en vertu du paragraphe (1) ainsi que le refus
de rendre une telle ordonnance sont, sur demande présentée dans les
trente jours de la décision par l'adolescent, son avocat, le procureur général
ou le représentant de celui-ci, examinés par la cour supérieure.  La cour
dispose d'un pouvoir discrétionnaire pour confirmer ou infirmer la décision du
tribunal pour adolescents. 

 

    (10) A decision made in respect of a young
person by a superior court under subsection (9) may, on application
of the young person or his counsel or the Attorney General or his agent made
within thirty days after the decision of the superior court, with the leave
of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that court, and the court of appeal may,
in its discretion, confirm or reverse the decision of the superior court. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    (10)
La décision concernant un adolescent rendue par une cour supérieure en
vertu du paragraphe (9) peut, sur demande présentée dans les
trente jours de la décision par l'adolescent, son avocat, le procureur général
ou le représentant de celui-ci, et avec la permission de la cour d'appel,
être revisée par celle-ci.  La cour d'appel dispose d'un pouvoir
discrétionnaire pour confirmer ou infirmer la décision de la Cour supérieure. 
[Je souligne.]

 

    Other
than possibly its residual supervisory power to correct jurisdictional
excesses, there is no inherent power in a superior court to review decisions
made by Youth Court judges at transfer hearings, and the jurisdiction of a
court of appeal to review such a decision of a superior court is likewise
limited to the scope of the enabling statute.  While the French text of s. 16(9)
and (10) removes any doubt that the superior court and the court of appeal
sitting in review do benefit from some discretion, it does not follow, in my
view, that the reviewing court is in all cases empowered to exercise that
discretion so as to be able, in weighing the relevant factors afresh, simply to
substitute its own view for that of the lower courts.  The words ""in its
discretion"" are not used in a vacuum.  They are used in relation to the
previous exercise of the same discretion by the Youth Court, a specialized
decision making body.  While the right of appeal must have some scope to be
efficacious, then so must the Youth Court's initial determination, as intended
by Parliament.  The scope of the discretion to review a matter properly brought
into appeal is, in my view, to be interpreted in light of the legislative grant
of exclusive jurisdiction to a specialized tribunal empowered to make the
initial determination at the transfer hearing.

 

    Language
comparable in breadth to the language used in s. 16(9) and (10) has been
interpreted by the courts to limit review where an error of some kind is
established to the satisfaction of the court.  A most striking illustration of
such a restrictive interpretation of the scope of statutory appeals is provided
in Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights' Canadian Ropes, Ltd., [1947]
A.C. 109 (P.C.), aff'g [1946] S.C.R. 139.  Under s. 6(2) of the Income War
Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, the Minister of National Revenue
was empowered to ""disallow any expense which he . . . may determine to be
in excess of what is reasonable"".  The Income War Tax Act also
provided that a person dissatisfied with the Minister's assessment could cause
the Minister to communicate to the Exchequer Court all relevant documents
relative to the disputed assessment, whereupon the matter was ""deemed to
be an action in the said Court ready for trial or hearing"" (s. 63(2)). 
The speech of Lord Greene, M.R., in the Privy Council shows the extent to which
a statutory right of appeal, though broadly framed, may nevertheless be limited
(at p. 122):

 

If the
matter had stood there, and there had been no right of appeal against the
decision of the Minister, the position would have been different from what it
is.  But in contrast to cases arising under sub-ss. 3 and 4 of s. 6, where the
decision of the Minister is to be ""final and conclusive"", a right
of appeal to the Exchequer Court is given, and the appeal is to be regarded as
an action in that court.  This right of appeal must, in their Lordships'
opinion, have been intended by the legislature to be an effective right.  This
involves the consequence that the court is entitled to examine the
determination of the Minister and is not necessarily to be bound to accept his
decision.  Nevertheless, the limits within which the court is entitled to
interfere are, in their Lordships' opinion, strictly circumscribed.  It is for
the taxpayer to show that there is ground for interference, and if he fails to
do so the decision of the Minister must stand.  Moreover, unless it be shown
that the Minister has acted in contravention of some principle of law the
court, in their Lordships' opinion, cannot interfere: the section makes the
Minister the sole judge of the fact of reasonableness or normalcy and the court
is not at liberty to substitute its own opinion for his.  [Emphasis added.]


 

I
entertain little doubt that, in the case at bar, the scope of the review is
more limited than the scope of the initial determination.  Since the Court of
Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal are not empowered to hear evidence de novo, the
restrictive interpretation of the Privy Council in Wrights' Ropes takes
on all the more significance here.

 

    A
second illustration is provided by Rowntree Co. v. Paulin Chambers Co., [1968]
S.C.R. 134, where this Court determined the nature of the appeal from the
Registrar of Trade Marks' decision not to allow a proposed trade mark on the
basis that it was confusing with a previously issued trade mark.  In
determining whether a trade mark is confusing, the Act directs the Registrar to
""have regard to all the surrounding circumstances"" including the
""inherent distinctiveness"" of the proposed trade mark, the
""length of time"" the previous trade mark has been registered, the ""nature
of the wares"", the ""nature of the trade"" and the ""degree of
resemblance"" between the two trade marks.  Note how this statutory
direction resembles the list of factors set out in s. 16(2) of the Young
Offenders Act.  At any rate, in Paulin Chambers, the
Registrar exercised his discretion and refused to grant a trade mark for the
word ""Smoothies"" on the grounds that it could be confused with the
previously issued trade mark under the word ""Smarties"".  On appeal,
the trial judge reversed the Registrar's conclusion.  On appeal to this Court,
the Registrar's finding was reinstated.  A restrictive interpretation of the
allowable scope of review was adopted by this Court (at p. 138):

 

    It
is contended on behalf of the respondent that the conclusion reached by the
learned trial judge should not be disturbed having regard to the terms of s.
55(5) of the Act which provides that ""on the appeal . . . the Court may
exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar"".  I do not, however,
take this as meaning that the Court is entitled to substitute its view for that
of the Registrar unless it can be shown that he proceeded on some wrong
principle or that he failed to exercise his discretion judicially. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    In
another case, Canadian Motorways Ltd. v. Laidlaw Motorways Ltd., [1974]
S.C.R. 675, this Court determined the related issue of the scope of review in
the context of an assessment by the Minister of Corporations that the corporate
name ""Laidlaw Motorways"" was not so similar to the name
""Canadian Motorways"" so as to be likely to deceive, within the
meaning of the applicable legislation.  The statute provided a right of
""review"" to the courts:

 

    12. . . .

 

    (3)
A person who feels aggrieved . . . may . . .  apply to the court for a review
of the matter, and the court may make an order changing the name of the
corporation to such name as it deems proper or may dismiss the application.

 

While
this right of ""review"" might at first blush appear to confer a large
discretion upon the reviewing court, a majority of this Court determined that
this was not so.  Laskin J. (as he then was), for himself and Spence J., wrote
(at p. 683):

 

    The
Court, in the exercise of the power of review conferred by s. 12(3), is
undoubtedly authorized to consider the meaning and application of the statutory
standard fixed under s. 12(1).  There is, however, the anterior question of the
scope of the power of review which has been granted.  ""Review"" is
not a hearing de novo but is related
here to a prior administrative decision.  I do not read the power to review as
authorizing a substitution of a judicial for an administrative opinion on no
other basis than disagreement with the administrative decision.  Nor do I
regard it as permitting a Court to come to a different conclusion merely on the
basis of its conclusion as to the weight of the evidence which was before the
administrative authority.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Pigeon
J. agreed in the result but expressed the view that he saw no difference
between a right of appeal and a right of review to a court.  This led him to
adopt a somewhat wider basis for intervention than the one advocated by Laskin
and Spence JJ. in the same case.  Pigeon J. concluded that the reviewing court
was empowered to reconsider the merits, although he did remark that such
reconsideration should be exercised ""always remembering that this being a
specialized judge with particular experience in the matter at hand, due weight
is to be given to his conclusions"" (p. 689).  This test is akin to the one
put forward by the Quebec Court of Appeal in J.R.D.

 

     Under
s. 16(9) and (10), in light of s. 5 , the general economy of the Act and the
necessarily incidental creation of a specialized body of decision-makers,
paying due tribute to curial deference in the Youth Court's area of expertise,
the discretion to confirm or reverse the decision of the Youth Court can, in my
view, be exercised only in cases where there is a serious ground for
intervention.  Errors of fact as well as errors of law would constitute such
serious grounds, but the test is intended to allow a somewhat broader basis for
review.  In some cases, it could allow the discretion to review to be exercised
where there is a substantial discrepancy between the reviewing court's and the
Youth Court's assessment of the relevant factors.  This test recognizes the
privileged position of the transfer hearing judge in determining questions of
fact in the Youth Court's area of expertise and makes fitting allowance for the
judge's familiarity with the resources of the youth care system, while at the
same time breathing life into the right of appeal.

 

    This
interpretation of s. 16(9) and (10) accommodates a sound policy reason not to
allow unfettered discretion to the reviewing court.  Such a discretion would
necessarily encourage a multiplicity of appeals which, in turn, would spoil
Parliament's intention to resolve transfer hearings speedily and expertly. 
Dragging the matter into appeal seriously hampers a young offender's entitlement
to the rehabilitative resources of the youth system.  Parliament could not have
intended this drastic consequence to result from its decision to exceptionally
allow the review of transfer hearings.

 

    In
conclusion on this point, it is my view that the Court of Appeal erred in
proceeding on the basis that it could simply substitute its own appreciation as
to whether a transfer should be ordered.  It found no error in the legal
principles applied by the Youth Court judge.  Nor did it state any serious
ground for intervention, as I next propose to show by considering how the Court
of Appeal interpreted the test for transfer.

 

III  Test
for Transfer

 

    The
test, set out by s. 16(1) of the Young Offenders Act for
transfer, is a balancing test:

 

    16. (1) At
any time after an information is laid against a young person alleged to have,
after attaining the age of fourteen years, committed an indictable offence . .
.  a youth court may . . . if the court is of the opinion that, in the interest
of society and having regard to the needs of the young person, the young person
should be proceeded against in ordinary court, order that the young person be
so proceeded . . .

 

In
making this assessment, the Youth Court is directed to a number of factors
listed in s. 16(2)  which I reproduce again for convenience:

 

    (2) In considering an application under subsection
(1) in respect of a young person, a youth court shall take into account 

 

    (2) Le tribunal pour adolescents saisi d'une demande
présentée en vertu du paragraphe (1) et visant un adolescent, doit tenir compte
des éléments suivants:

 

(a) the seriousness of the alleged offence and the
circumstances in which it was allegedly committed;

 

a) la gravité de l'infraction et ses circonstances;

 

(b) the age, maturity, character and background of the
young person and any record or summary of previous findings of delinquency
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act [c. J-3 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970] or previous findings of guilt under this or
any other Act of Parliament or any regulation made thereunder;

 

b) l'âge, le degré de maturité, le caractère et les
antécédents de l'adolescent, de même que tout résumé des délits antérieurs
relevant de la Loi sur les jeunes délinquants, [chap.
J-3 des Statuts révisés du Canada de 1970] ou des déclarations de culpabilités
antérieures intervenues dans le cadre de la présente loi, ou de toute autre loi
du Parlement ou de leurs règlements d'application;

 

(c) the adequacy of this Act, and the adequacy of the Criminal
Code  or other Act of Parliament that would apply in respect
of the young person if an order were made under subsection (1), to meet the
circumstances of the case;

 

c) l'opportunité, compte tenu des circonstances de
l'espèce, de soumettre l'adolescent à la présente loi ou au Code
criminel  ou à une autre loi du Parlement, si une ordonnance
était rendue en conformité avec le paragraphe (1);

 

(d) the availability of treatment or correctional
resources;

 

d) l'existence de moyens de traitement ou de
réadaptation;

 

(e) any representations made to the court by or on behalf
of the young person or by the Attorney General or his agent; and

 

e) les observations qui lui ont été présentées par
l'adolescent ou en son nom, par le procureur général ou par le représentant de
celui-ci;

 

(f) any other factors that the court considers relevant. 

 

f) tous
autres éléments qu'il considère pertinents.

 

    Here
again the history of the legislation is instructive.  Prior to 1982, s. 9 of
the Juvenile Delinquents Act allowed a transfer provided the youth
court ""is of the opinion that the good of the child and the interest of
the community demand it"".  In expounding what the words ""good of the
child"" meant, juvenile courts under the previous legislation did not
benefit from a statutory description of the relevant factors as is today
present in s. 16(2) .  While the ""good of the child"" initially had
been held by the case law to encompass the benefits of a public criminal trial,
the courts gradually rejected this approach and eventually came to recognize
that the expression chiefly alluded to the likelihood of successful treatment. 
As noted by Bowker (loc. cit., at p. 391):

 

    More
and more, the paramount consideration in determining the ""good of the
child"" focused on the juvenile's potential for rehabilitation within the
Juvenile Court system.

 

This
approach was adopted by Parliament in enacting the Young Offenders Act and is
enshrined in s. 16(2)(b), (c) and (d).  

 

    The
needs of the young person find expression in s. 16(2) (b).  In
requiring the Youth Court judge to consider the age, maturity and character of
the offender, Parliament recognizes that the special treatment of young
offenders is premised in part on their immaturity.  This immaturity would cause
young persons to be unable to fully evaluate the consequences of their actions,
on the one hand, and, on the other, it also facilitates their rehabilitation. 
In addition, when associating with adult criminals in an adult prison, the
immaturity of youths gives rise to legitimate fears that they will forever lose
any hope of being rehabilitated.  The consequences of incarceration in adult
quarters may not only be drastic but in some cases fatal.  The decision to transfer
a youth to adult prison is a most serious decision, one which may possibly
cause irreparable damage to the youth and to society as well.

 

    Accordingly,
any evidence that the emotional and intellectual development of the young
offender is greater than one could expect of a person of the same physical age
may suggest that the Youth Court's exclusive jurisdiction should be waived. 
Conversely, evidence of immaturity or impressionability would militate in
favour of tending to the young person's needs within the system.  The young
person's age and criminal background are to be considered in this context. 
Where there is a reasonable likelihood that the young person's immaturity and
character could work to his disadvantage in the ordinary court or correctional
facilities, s. 16(2) (b) weighs against transfer.

 

    Section
16(2) (c) directs the Youth Court judge, in light of all the
circumstances, to assess the respective suitability of the Young
Offenders Act, the Criminal Code  and any other
relevant Act.  The Youth Court judge must first consider any circumstances
which may diminish the likelihood that the objective of reformation of criminal
behaviour set out by the Act will be attained in the circumstances of the
case.  For instance, evidence that the proposed treatment will take longer than
the period of custody allowed for by the legislation is relevant here.  To take
another example, the fact that the offence was committed against, or within,
the youth system would tend to indicate that the system, and therefore the Act,
is inadequate.  As well, evidence that the protection of society cannot be
ensured by detention facilities of the youth system, such as a prior record of
escape in the case of a violent offender, would be apposite here.  This is not
intended to be an exhaustive list of factors.  If the judge finds that the
youth system offers no reasonable likelihood that the rehabilitation objective
will be attained, then that is the end of the inquiry under s. 16(2)(c).  If,
however, such a possibility exists, then the judge must move to a second level
of inquiry.  The judge must turn to evidence that the rehabilitation needs of
the young person could be served in the ordinary penitentiary system.  The
potential for treatment must then be appraised and compared.  Transfer would be
favoured if the likelihood of successful treatment in the ordinary penitentiary
system is greater than the same likelihood in the youth system.

 

    Section
16(2) (d) speaks for itself, although once again there is a
slight discrepancy between the English and French texts.  The French text
clearly states that the availability of means of ""treatment or rehabilitation""
are to be considered.  The English text instead refers to ""treatment or correctional
resources"".  I think this is a proper case for the application of the ejusdem
generis rule.  The criminal law is premised on the availability
of correctional resources.  If the section read ""the availability of
correctional resources"", it would be meaningless.  Consequently, the word
""correctional"" must be given a meaning consistent with the companion
word ""treatment"".  It follows that, under s. 16(2) (d),
germane evidence includes evidence that the youth court system does not provide
the facilities needed to treat that young person.  Equally relevant is evidence
that the youth has exhausted the resources of the system.

 

    The
other major element to be balanced, the ""interest of society"", is a
broad concept.  On the one hand, it incorporates the legitimate interest that
those persons guilty of a criminal offence will be prosecuted and convicted. 
Reinforcement of fundamental societal values through the deterrence of criminal
conduct and the punishment of criminals is a legitimate goal for the benefit of
society.  On the other hand, society's interest also commands the
rehabilitation of criminals and their reintegration into society.  This is
especially relevant in the case of young criminals for whom the possibilities
of rehabilitation are greater.  The preamble to the 1908 legislation stresses
that the welfare of the community demands that young offenders be
""subjected to such wise care, treatment and control as will tend to check
their evil tendencies and to strengthen their better instincts"".  Indeed,
the Young Offenders Act itself is premised in part on the
notion that the reformation of the young criminal is in the interest of all, in
accord with the truism that the youths of today contain the hope for tomorrow's
society.  These objectives, though complemented by other policies, have not
been set aside by Parliament in the legislative reform of 1982.

 

    At
this juncture, I find it necessary to remark on a proposition which has found
some support in the case law.  Under s. 9 of the previous Act, in deciding
whether to allow transfer, the Youth Court judge was directed to have regard to
""the good of the child and the interest of the community"".  Section
16(1)  reversed the order of these factors, pressing the Youth Court judge to
consider ""the interest of society and having regard to the needs of the
young person"".  Some courts have considered this shift in emphasis to
indicate that a priority attaches to the interest of society.  In R. v.
L.A.M. (1986), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 364 (B.C.C.A.), the court speaks
of ""a clear shift of emphasis in favour of the interest of society""
and in R. v. M., supra, the court mentions ""a slight
emphasis on the interest of society"" (p. 541).  However, in other
decisions, this change in drafting gives no preponderance whatsoever to the
interest of society.  I adopt as my own the following passage of MacKinnon
A.C.J.O.'s reasons in M.A.Z., supra, at p. 162:

 

    In
light of s. 3, I do not think that the interest of society or the needs and
interests of the young person are to be given greater importance one over the
other.  They are to be weighed against each other having regard to the matters
directed to be considered in s. 16(2) .

 

    The
interest in reinforcing fundamental societal values finds incidental expression
in s. 16(2) (a).  The seriousness of an offence relates only
indirectly to the rehabilitative objectives of the legislation.  The more
fundamental purpose of this element would appear to be deterrence.  Section
16(2) (a) is premised on the notion that some criminal conduct
may not be sufficiently dissuaded when tried before the Youth Court, perhaps on
account of the publicity of trials and the severity of punishment in ordinary
courts.  These are all characteristics of the ordinary criminal process.  There
is a danger in over-emphasizing the importance of this element, particularly since
Parliament has not seen fit to provide for automatic transfers to adult courts
for such serious crimes as murder or aggravated sexual assault.  The Committee
on Juvenile Delinquency aptly formulated this concern as follows (Juvenile
Delinquency in Canada, op. cit., at p. 79):   

 

[I]t
does not follow from the fact alone that an offence is one that the law regards
as particularly heinous, including on occasion even murder or rape, that an
offender is not amenable to the treatment approach of the juvenile court,
however much public sentiment may be aroused.

 

Youths
involved in allegedly serious offences may be as much if not more in need of
the treatment provided to other youths.  The seriousness of the offence may or
may not have great bearing on the potential for rehabilitation.  It captures
the right of society to be vindicated.  In this respect, one author commented
(Jane Morley, ""Transfer of Children to the Ordinary Criminal Courts:  A
Case of Legislative Limbo"" (1979), 5 Queen's L.J. 288,
at p. 307):

 

    Accepting
seriousness as an appropriate criterion causes additional problems in that it
leaves the door open to the influence of public opinion.  A child who commits a
heinous act for whatever reasons is in a very poor position.  The more violent
and contemptible the offence, the more publicity it will receive and the more
public outrage will be generated.  In such cases, seriousness is a convenient
handle by which to justify fulfilling community expectations.

 

    On
the other hand, the punishment provided by the Act may be thought to be
inadequate in the face of a particularly revolting crime.  This is no doubt a
legitimate concern but the shortcomings of the legislation, which the
legislature can always rectify, should not penalize young offenders.  Perhaps
the difficulties experienced by the Court of Appeal of Alberta in the present
case find their origin in the considerable difference between the length of
incarceration provided for by the Criminal Code  and the
length of custody allowed by the Young Offenders Act in
connection with the most serious offences.  If the Act allowed for longer
periods of treatment perhaps the courts would be less inclined to lose sight of
the commitment toward the rehabilitation of young offenders.  However, this is
not a concern for the courts.  As noted by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. in M.A.Z., supra, at p.
162:

 

This is
obviously an area for consideration and possible amendment by those responsible
for the Act.

 

    I
find it appropriate here to stress that, as the transfer hearing proceeds
before the trial, the offence charged is not to be taken as having been
established.  Neither are the alleged circumstances to be taken as proven
facts.  It may very well turn out that the evidence does not support the
initial charge and allegations.  The present case illustrates this.  During his
oral pleading, counsel informed this Court that while this appeal was pending,
S.H.M.'s case proceeded to preliminary inquiry, albeit over the objections of
the youth.  Counsel added that, as a result of the inquiry, S.H.M. was
committed for trial, not on a charge of first degree murder, but rather on a
charge of second degree murder.

 

    In
light of this background I now propose to briefly review the findings made in
the courts below with respect to each of the factors enumerated in s. 16(2) .

 

    Pursuant
to s. 16(2) (a), Gerhart Prov. Ct. J. considered the seriousness of
the offence.  He noted that ""[t]he offence of first degree murder is one of
the most serious offences under the Criminal Code  and for
which the minimum punishment is life imprisonment"" and that ""[t]he
allegation of the commission of a serious offence such as murder is a weighty
factor . . . .""  Gerhart Prov. Ct. J. also considered the circumstances of
the alleged offence, noting that the Crown had ""submitted evidence in
support of the proposition that S.H.M. was a party to the brutal, callous,
senseless slaying"" of Dreifus.  He concluded:

 

    The
seriousness of the alleged offence and the circumstances alleged surrounding
their commission, without more, would seem to weigh in favour of a transfer.

 

    In
the Court of Queen's Bench, Miller A.C.J.Q.B. was not blind to the element of
seriousness.  In dismissing the application for review, he stated that he did
""in no way wish to minimize the gravity of the offence and some of the
surrounding circumstances"".

 

    In
the Court of Appeal, Laycraft C.J.A. shared the assessment of the Youth Court
judge that the element of seriousness favored transfer.  His reasons for
judgment suggest that he was strongly impressed by ""the callous and brutal
nature of the crime alleged and the insensitivity of the perpetrators as they
sold the property while the victim lay dead in the basement"" (p. 3l7).

 

    All
courts below were in agreement that s. 16(2) (a)
favoured transfer in the circumstances of the case.

 

    In
respect of s. 16(2) (b), S.H.M. was found to have been 17 years and eleven
months of age at the time of the alleged offence.  However, Gerhart Prov. Ct.
J. concluded that his intellectual and emotional development were much lower
than his physical age would suggest.  According to a report prepared by a
psychiatrist who testified for the Crown, Dr. Lang, S.H.M. has a
""full-scale I.Q."" of 84, which was characterized by him as being
""in the ""Low Average"" range of intelligence"".  As well,
upon cross-examination by counsel for S.H.M., Dr. Lang characterized S.H.M.
""as emotionally about 13 or 14 years of age and a follower rather than a leader,
a passive, frightened little boy"".  Dr. Lang expressed the opinion that
S.H.M. ""exhibited neurotic behaviour but was not a disturbed psychotic or
schizophrenic"".  To help S.H.M. with ""life skills"", Dr. Lang
recommended group therapy, two hours per week, for one or two years.  A report
prepared by another psychiatrist, Dr. Brooks, was also adduced by the Crown. 
The report indicated that ""[a]lthough his [S.H.M.] personality problems
would benefit from treatment, this would not be essential to his
well-being"".

 

    Although
there is no specific acknowledgement of this in the reasons for judgment, the
Predisposition Report, necessarily part of the record by virtue of s. 16(3) of
the Act, records a single prior conviction as a juvenile for joyriding under s.
295  of the Criminal Code .  S.H.M. was also
convicted for gross indecency under s. 157 of the then Criminal
Code .  The report states that when S.H.M. was charged with
that offence he was an adult.  He appeared and pleaded guilty in the regular
court on June 26, 1986.  He received a suspended sentence and three years
probation.

 

    On
the whole, it is fair to conclude that in Gerhart Prov. Ct. J.'s view, s.
16(2) (b) did not significantly weigh in favour of transfer in
the overall assessment.

 

    In
the Court of Queen's Bench, Miller A.C.J.Q.B. did not pass upon this element in
great detail, simply stating:  ""there is something to be said for the fact
that this young man, although he has established some very bad lifestyle
habits, had not come into serious difficulty with the law before this incident
occurred.  There is no record of prior violence"".

 

    In
the Court of Appeal, Laycraft C.J.A. noted that ""had the events occurred
three and one-half weeks later, S.H.M. would, without more, have been liable to
the full adult penalties for first degree murder"" (p. 315).  Laycraft
C.J.A. also considered the emotional and intellectual development of S.H.M.,
though he cast doubt on the credibility of the psychiatric assessment adduced
at trial (at p. 313):

 

    His
I.Q. was found to be 84 which is ""low average"" or ""dull
normal"" . . . ""equal to or better than only 15 per cent of his
peers"".  His emotional age is described as 4 to 5 years lower than his
chronological age.  He is shy, introverted, self conscious, easily hurt and
perceives himself to be isolated and disliked by his teachers and his peers.  One
witness describes him as passive and ""more a follower than a leader""
though, the Crown's allegations, if established, would not support that
assessment.  [Emphasis added.]

 

This
last remark, in my respectful view, does not seem to be supported by the
record.

 

    With
respect to S.H.M.'s prior convictions, Laycraft C.J.A. noted (at p. 317):

 

    I
also respectfully disagree with the observation in Court of Queen's Bench that
this offender had no record of violence.  His record showed two counts of
sexual assault against nine and ten year old boys.  Sexual assault is
essentially a crime of violence even if the young victims were compliant as
S.H.M. asserts.  What effect this 1984 offence has on this transfer application
is, of course, another matter.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Again,
these remarks do not appear to be supported by the record.  The pre-disposition
report adduced as evidence at trial shows a count of gross indecency (s. 157 of
the then Criminal Code ) but no count of
sexual assault (s. 246 of the then Code).  This evidence
was undisputed in the Youth Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.  The
written evidence adduced at the transfer hearing does not disclose the
circumstances described by the Court of Appeal.  Gross indecency does not
necessarily involve violence.  To be made out, the offence does not require the
non-consensual application of force to another person as does assault.

 

    While
in Laycraft C.J.A.'s view, s. 16(2) (b)
favored transfer, this conclusion was premised in substantial part on an
erroneous interpretation of the evidence.  In addition, the Court of Appeal did
not find any palpable error in the findings of fact made by the Youth Division
nor did it in any way pay curial deference to that court.

 

    Turning
to s. 16(2) (c), Gerhart Prov. Ct. J. considered the comparative
""adequacy"" of the Young Offenders Act and that of the Criminal
Code  as part of the overall balancing.  The expression
""adequacy"" was understood to focus on the rehabilitative aspect of
the respective enactments:

 

    The minimum disposition under the Criminal
Code  for the offence of first degree murder is life
imprisonment.  The maximum disposition under the Young Offenders Act is
three years secure custody.

 

    The
Court, in determining the adequacy of the Young Offenders Act or of
the Criminal Code , must bear in mind the age and maturity of the young
person together with any evidence as to the necessity for prolonged treatment. 
There is no evidence before the Court with respect to the necessity for
confinement for treatment longer than available under the Young
Offenders Act . The Court is therefore of the opinion that the Young
Offenders Act  is adequate to meet the needs of society and of the
accused S.H.M.

 

Gerhart
Prov. Ct. J. was satisfied on the evidence adduced before him that S.H.M. would
be amenable to treatment within a three-year period spent in the youth system. 
He was of the view that the evidence did not establish that a longer treatment
would be necessary.

 

    In
the Court of Queen's Bench, Miller A.C.J.Q.B. similarly contemplated the
adequacy of the Young Offenders Act when he wrote:

 

Because
of the reports on file which indicate that with proper guidance and some
treatment, [S.H.M.]  may still be salvaged and be a useful citizen to society,
I am prepared to give him the benefit of the provisions of the Young Offenders
Act . . . .

 

    In
the Court of Appeal, however, the emphasis was on the retributive aspect of
adequacy.  Laycraft C.J.A. wrote (at p. 316):

 

    The
""interest of society"" to which  the section [s. 16(1) ] refers
includes the protection of society, itself, from the offender, as well  as the
enforcement of the standard of penalty which Parliament has seen fit to fix for
first degree murder.  That crime attracts the most serious sanction in our
criminal law.  The sanction sets forth the reaction of Canadian society to the
crime, as seen by the enactment of its elected representatives.  By contrast
the three year maximum penalty prescribed by the Young Offenders Act may
be seen, in some cases, as an absurdly inadequate response.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

    With
respect for the learned opinion of the Court of Appeal, s. 16(1)(a)
already provides for a consideration of the seriousness of the crime.  It
appears that, in considering ""adequacy"", the Court of Appeal in
effect gave additional regard to the element of seriousness of the crime in
underscoring the need for correlative punishment.  In my view the Court failed
to recognize that the element of ""adequacy"" focusses on the
likelihood that the youth's need for rehabilitation and treatment will be met. 
As a result, while the Court expressed the view that s. 16(2) (c)
favoured transfer, that conclusion was premised on an erroneous interpretation
of the element of ""adequacy"".

 

    In
considering s. 16(2) (d), Gerhart Prov. Ct. J. heard evidence from witnesses
called by the Crown.  These witnesses testified that the provincial correctional
facilities provided adequate psychiatric facilities.  It was the opinion of one
of these witnesses that S.H.M.'s group counselling needs could be met in either
the young offender system or the ordinary correctional system.  Gerhart Prov.
Ct. J. accepted this evidence and found that ""S.H.M. will be adequately
served in either the Young Offenders system or in the Adult system"". 
Although the use of the word ""adequately"" may lead to confusion when
used in the context of s. 16(2) (d), it is clear from
the present context that Gerhart Prov. Ct. J. meant that the necessary
resources were available in either system.  The availability of resources was
not discussed in the Court of Queen's Bench nor in the Court of Appeal.  Given
that the Court carefully reviewed the other conclusions of the Youth Court,
this silence may be taken as implicit approval.

 

    As a
result, of the four elements considered, the Court of Appeal agreed with the
Youth Court that two of these militated in favour transfer.  It took a
different view on the other two elements, though, as I have attempted to show,
these conclusions are in part unsupported by the record and inextricably bound
to an erroneous interpretation of s. 16(2) (c).  In
my view, these circumstances fail to disclose a serious ground for the exercise
of the Court of Appeal's power of review.

 

IV  -   Conclusion

 

    On
the whole, I am led to the conclusion that in the present case s. 16(9) and
(10) of the Act did not authorize the Court of Appeal to substitute its own
evaluation of the circumstances for the evaluation of the Youth Division.  No
error of fact or of law was committed by the Youth Division.  Nor are there any
other serious grounds for intervention.

 

    In
fact, the Court of Appeal itself proceeded on the footing of an incorrect
interpretation of s. 16(1) and (2) of the Act.  It misconceived the burden of
proof required for a transfer.  The history and purpose of the legislation as
well as the English and French texts of the provisions set a threshold more
onerous than simply ""favouring"" transfer, as was held in the Court of
Appeal.  In my view, the burden falls squarely on the applicant to persuade the
court that no solution other than transfer is appropriate.

 

    This
is a case where the additional expertise of the Youth Division and its
privileged situation in assessing the expert testimony should have prevailed
over any perceived differences of opinion in the Court of Appeal.  In the
circumstances of this particular case, the Youth Division was convinced that
the Crown had failed on its burden to show why a transfer should be ordered. 
In the Youth Court's view, the element of seriousness, which favoured transfer,
was outweighed by the other elements, which were either neutral or weighed
against transfer.  As found by the Youth Division, the available treatment
facilities and the character of the youth gave rise to a sufficient likelihood
that treatment would be successful.  As the youth would not be likewise
amenable to rehabilitation in the ordinary penal system, the balancing test
under s. 16(1)  and (2)  required, in the Youth Court's view, that he not be
transferred.  In the absence of any serious ground for intervention, this
conclusion should have conclusively determined the fate of the appellant as
regards his transfer to the ordinary court system.

 

    As a
result, I would allow the appeal and quash the order to transfer S.H.M. to
ordinary court.  I would restore the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench
dismissing the appeal from the decision of the Youth Division.

    J.E.L.
and another youth, S.H.M., were charged with first degree murder and with
possession of stolen property.  The Crown brought an application to have them
transferred to ordinary court pursuant to s. 16 of the Young
Offenders Act.  The Crown contended that on April 30, 1986 they
accompanied a homosexual male to his home.  The man allegedly attempted sexual
relations with one of the youth who struck him and rendered him
unconscious.  The youths then bound the man with electrical wire,
strangled him and concealed the body in the basement.  They lived in the
victim's house some days and tried to dispose of his stereo and computer
equipment. J.E.L. was 17 years and 6 months old at the time of the alleged
offences.  He had prior convictions for theft and mischief.  The
pre-disposition report indicates that J.E.L.'s behaviour deteriorated following
the death of his father in 1983.  Since 1984, he has been in the care of
Alberta Social Services.  The psychiatric evidence concerning J.E.L. was
conflicting.  According to the defence psychiatrist, there was a strong
possibility that he could re-establish close relationships which might result
in abandonment of his anti-social ways.  The Crown psychiatrist was of the
opinion that J.E.L. suffered from an untreatable personality disorder.  Tests
conducted on J.E.L. reveal that he is of above average intelligence.

 

    The
Youth Court judge considered the factors set out in s. 16(2) of the Act
and declined to order the transfer. The Court of Queen's Bench upheld the
ruling but the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment.  J.E.L. appealed to this
Court. The issues on this appeal were the same as in R. v. M. (S.H.), [1984]
2 S.C.R. 000.

 

    Held (La
Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  The Court
of Appeal did not err in the view it took of the nature of the burden on the
Crown.  While there is a burden on the party seeking transfer to persuade the
court that transfer to ordinary court is appropriate on the factors set out in
s. 16(2) of the Act, the onus should not be regarded as a heavy one.  The
question is whether the judge is satisfied, after weighing and balancing all
the relevant considerations, that the case should be transferred to ordinary
court. 

 

    The
Court of Appeal was correct in its interpretation of the nature of the review
process. While the provincial reviewing court must base its decision on
the findings of fact made by the Youth Court judge and give due deference to
that judge's evaluation of the evidence, s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act
confers on the provincial courts of review a discretion to make an independent
evaluation and arrive at an independent conclusion on those facts.

 

    The
Court of Appeal properly applied the relevant factors for transfer from Youth
Court to ordinary court. The court considered the gravity and heinous nature of
the alleged offences to be an important factor but its reasons clearly indicate
that it also bore in mind the other factors prescribed by the Act.  The court,
in the exercise of its discretion, is not required to accord equal weight to
all factors; given the nature of the case, some may loom larger than others.

 

    Per La
Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. (dissenting): The Court of Appeal erred in
ordering the transfer of J.E.L. to ordinary court. The transfer of a youth to
the ordinary court under s. 16(1) of the Young Offenders Act must
propose itself to the Youth Court judge's mind as the only appropriate
solution. The burden falls squarely on the applicant to persuade the court that
no solution other than transfer is appropriate in the circumstances of a
particular case. In this case, the Court of Appeal misconceived the burden of
proof required for transfer.  This error pervaded its assessment of the
evidence relating to the elements to be considered under s. 16.

 

    The
discretion to confirm or reverse the decision of the Youth Court under
s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act can only be exercised in cases where there is
a serious ground for intervention.  Errors of fact as well as errors of law
would constitute such serious grounds, but the test is intended to allow a
somewhat broader basis for review.  In some cases, it could allow the
discretion to review to be exercised where there is a substantial discrepancy
between the reviewing court's and the Youth Court's assessment of the relevant
factors.  Here, the Court of Appeal erred in proceeding on the basis that
it could only substitute its own appreciation as to whether a transfer should
be made.

 

    The
Court of Appeal expressed no serious disagreement with the analysis of the
Youth Court judge. The sole difference between the two courts was that the
Court of Appeal considered the transfer of J.E.L.'s accomplice, S.H.M., to be a
relevant consideration. While the transfer of a co-accused may be relevant, it
is only a single element which must be weighed in light of the other elements
stated in s. 16(2).  In view of the importance of the other elements in
that section which were not discussed at any length by the Court of Appeal, the
court simply substituted its view for that of the Youth Court in an area lying
at the heart of that court's expertise. No error of fact or of law was found in
the reasons of the Youth Court, nor did the Court of Appeal state any other
serious ground for intervention. This was a case where the additional expertise
of the Youth Court and its privileged situation in assessing the expert
testimony should have prevailed over only minor differences of opinion.

    The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Lamer, Wilson, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and
McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

    MCLACHLIN J. --
This appeal, heard together with R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989]
2 S.C.R. 000, concerns the requirements for transfer of young offenders from
Youth Court to ordinary court under the Young Offenders Act, S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 110. 

 

The
Facts

 

    The
facts giving rise to the charges have been set out in my reasons in R. v. M.
(S.H.) and need not be repeated.  Suffice it to say that the
circumstances alleged by the Crown, if proven, establish the commission of a
heinous offence in callous manner.   Separate charges were laid against each of
the young offenders, and each proceeded independently.  In the case of J.E.L.,
as with S.H.M., the Youth Court judge declined to order transfer to ordinary
court.  The Court of Queen's Bench upheld that ruling.  The Court of Appeal
overturned it, ordering J.E.L. to stand trial in ordinary court.  J.E.L. now
appeals to this Court.

 

    The
background of J.E.L. was troubled.    At the time of the alleged offences,
J.E.L. was 17 years, 6 months of age.   He had prior convictions for theft over
$200 and mischief, for each of which he was sentenced to six months'
probation.     The pre-disposition report describes J.E.L. as enjoying a stable
and close relationship with members of his family until his father's death in
February, 1983.   He was extremely close to his father who apparently offered a
degree of discipline which his mother was subsequently unable to do.  Following
the death of his father, J.E.L.'s behaviour deteriorated; school suspensions
and incidents of running away from home occurred.    Since August of 1984,
J.E.L. has been in the care of Alberta Social Services in various group homes
and a boarding apartment situation.

 

    The
testimony of the psychiatrists concerning J.E.L. is conflicting.   According to
the defence psychiatrist, there is a strong possibility that J.E.L. can
re-establish close relationships which might result in abandonment of his
anti-social ways.     The Crown psychiatrist took the bleaker view that J.E.L.
suffered from an untreatable personality disorder.  Tests conducted on J.E.L.
reveal he is of above average intelligence;  his troubles at school and his
inability to remain employed would seem to stem more from a lack of motivation
than a lack of ability.

 

Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

    The
relevant statutory provisions are those set out in my reasons in R. v. M.
(S.H.)

 

Judgments

 

Youth
Court: Judge Hansen

 

    Like
her counterpart in the companion case of R. v. S.H.M.
(1986), 17 W.C.B. 322, the Provincial Court judge examined the factors and
principles set out in s. 16 of the Young Offenders Act.   She
seems to have preferred the evidence of the defence psychiatrist, stating that
she was not satisfied that J.E.L. was suffering from a personality disorder of
the anti-social type.   After considering the different penalties provided by
the Acts, the seriousness of the offences, the age, development and maturity of
the appellant, and the fact that the goal of the Young Offenders Act  is
rehabilitation, the judge found that the period of sentence or disposition
under the Young Offenders Act  was sufficient for
the appellant to receive the therapy he needed.   She noted that federal
institutions are not designed to deal with young offenders and that ""there
is always a long term risk that incarceration in an adult institution could be
detrimental to a young offender's development and ultimate
rehabilitation"".

 

    The
Youth Court judge then turned to the onus on the Crown to justify transfer.   
Noting that the test in s. 16(1) of the Young Offenders Act places
the primary emphasis on the interest of society of the needs of the young
person,  she stated the interest of society goes beyond the protection of
society to include the principles of accountability, responsibility, and
rehabilitation of young offenders and she concluded that while ""[t]he
Crown is not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the young
person should be transferred"", the onus is nevertheless ""a heavy
one"".   Given the onus, she concluded that transfer was not appropriate,
stating:

 

    I am
not satisfied on the evidence that the Crown has discharged the heavy onus.  
There is no compelling reason in the interest of society that he should be
transferred.   Having regard to the needs of J.E.L., he has not exhausted the
young offenders system and, in fact, there is a specific program within the
youth system designed to meet his treatment needs and hopefully affect his
rehabilitation and, accordingly, the application for transfer on each count is
denied.

 

Alberta
Court of Queen's Bench:  Veit J.

 

    Veit
J. took the view that the review procedure contemplated under s. 16(9) of the Young
Offenders Act was akin to an administrative law judicial review.  
The reviewing court, in her opinion, could not substitute its discretion for
that of the Youth Court judge.    Rather, the reviewing court's jurisdiction
was limited to assessing jurisdiction and determining if the transfer court
judge has made an error of law.

 

    On
the question of the burden of proof on the Crown, Veit J. stated that although
the phrase ""heavy onus"" was unfortunate, the lower court judge had
correctly considered whether the interests of society would be served by
transfer.   She expressed the view that the phrase ""heavy onus"" was
merely meant to emphasize that transfers to adult court were not to be
automatic.   Having found that the hearing judge had adopted the correct test
under s. 16(1) by noting that the primary emphasis was on the interests of
society over the needs of the young person, and having concluded that the
hearing judge did not fail in her appreciation of the evidence, Veit J.
confirmed the Youth Court judge's ruling against transfer to ordinary court.

 

Court of
Appeal:  Lieberman, McClung and Irving JJ.A.

 

    McClung
J.A., writing for the court, found that the decision of Veit J. was
inconsistent with the Court of Appeal's ruling in the companion case of R. v.
S.H.M. (1987), 78 A.R. 309, and that she had erred in
confining the role of a reviewing court to determining jurisdiction and
reviewing for error.   In the Court of Appeal's view, the review court is
empowered to confirm or reverse the decision before it ""in its discretion"",
entitling it to render the decision which it believes should have been given
initially.   Stating that he had assessed the evidence and factors in this case
and noting that ""[t]his homicide was not a crime of adolescent
proportion"",    McClung J.A. concluded that a transfer to ordinary court
should be ordered.

 

Issues

 

    The
issues on this appeal are the same as in R. v. M. (S.H.): (1)
the nature of the burden on the applicant for transfer to ordinary court; (2)
the nature of review on appeal; and (3) whether the Court of Appeal erred in
application of the test for transfer.

 

Discussion

 

1.  The
Burden on the Applicant

 

    In R. v. M.
(S.H.) I concluded that while there is a burden on the party
seeking transfer to persuade the court that transfer to ordinary court is
appropriate on the factors set out in s. 16(2) of the Act, the onus should not
be regarded as a heavy one.  The question is whether the judge is satisfied,
after weighing and balancing all the relevant considerations, that the case
should be transferred to ordinary court.

 

    The
Court of Appeal did not err in its appreciation of this principle in the case
at bar.

 

2.  The Nature
of the Review Process

 

    In R. v. M.
(S.H.), I set out my views on the nature of the review process
in the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal.  While the reviewing
court must base its decision on the findings of fact made by the Youth Court
judge and give due deference to that judge's evaluation of the evidence, the Young
Offenders Act confers on the provincial courts of review a discretion
to make an independent evaluation and arrive at an independent conclusion on
those facts.

 

    In
my opinion, the Court of Appeal did not err in its interpretation of the nature
of the review process.

 

3.  Whether
the Court Erred in Application of the Relevant Factors

  

    The
reasons in this case, as in R. v. M. (S.H.), indicate that the
Court of Appeal considered the gravity and heinous nature of the alleged
offences to be an important factor in determining whether the case should be
transferred to ordinary court.  But its reasons make clear that it also bore in
mind the other factors prescribed by the Act.  The court, in the exercise of
its discretion, is not required to accord equal weight to all factors; given
the nature of the case, some may loom larger than others.  I can find no error
in the Court of Appeal's application of the principles to the facts of this
case.

 

Conclusion

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

    The
reasons of La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

    L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J.
(dissenting) -- With deference, having had the benefit of reading the reasons
of my colleague Justice McLachlin, I am unable to subscribe to her opinion nor
can I agree with her disposition of the present appeal.

 

    This
case was heard at the same time as R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989]
2 S.C.R. 000 (reasons delivered concurrently).  It raises the same issues.  In
accordance with the reasons I gave in R. v. M. (S.H.), I am
of the view that the Court of Appeal erred in ordering that J.E.L. be
transferred to ordinary court.

 

    In
light of these comments, I now propose to briefly review the findings made in
the courts below as regards the three issues raised in this appeal, namely, the
burden of proof required to justify transfer of a youth pursuant to s. 16 of
the Young Offenders Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 110, the
scope of review allowed by s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act, and the proper test
for transfer, as set out in s. 16(1) and (2) of the Act.

 

    Before
doing so, however, I find it appropriate to recall that J.E.L. was charged with
first degree murder, theft and possession of stolen property in connection with
the killing of George Dreifus.  Although S.H.M. and J.E.L. were not jointly
charged, it was alleged that they had both participated in the killing.  We were
informed that, recently, after having proceeded to preliminary inquiry over the
youths' objections, the charge was reduced to second degree murder.

 

I  -  Burden
of Proof

 

    The
French and the English texts of s. 16(1) of the Act must be read together in order
to find a common interpretation in accord with Parliament's intent and the
basic philosophy of the legislation, including the exceptional nature of
transfers.  For the reasons I gave in R. v. M. (S.H.), and
having regard to all the requirements in s. 16, I am of the view that, under s.
16(1) of the Young Offenders Act, the transfer of
the youth to the ordinary court must propose itself to the Youth Court judge's
mind as the only appropriate solution.

 

    In
the case at bar, the Youth Division considered that the burden on an applicant
under s. 16(1) of the Act is a ""heavy"" one.  Hansen Prov. Ct. J.
said:

 

    The
Crown is not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the young
person should be transferred however the onus on the Crown is a heavy one.

 

    In
the Court of Queens' Bench, Veit J. commented on the notion of a ""heavy
onus"", although she appeared not to endorse the use of such an onus.  She
said:

 

    It
may be unfortunate that the expression ""heavy onus"" has crept into
judicial language with respect to the onus on a transfer applicant.  One might
have thought that one of the traditional tests would suffice: establish beyond
a reasonable doubt or on a balance of probabilities.  By adopting a third,
probably intermediate, standard, the existing jurisprudence undoubtedly wishes
to emphasize only that Parliament has decided that young persons should be
dealt with in a particular way; it has not established automatic transfers to
the ordinary courts either for a certain age class of young persons or for
certain types of offences.  The jurisprudence emphasizes that a transfer
hearing judge must recognize this overall intention of Parliament on the burden
of satisfying the tests in s. 16(1).

 

    In
the Court of Appeal, McClung J.A. did not expressly comment upon the burden,
although it is clear that he followed the decision of Laycraft C.J.A. in R. v.
S.H.M. (1987), 78 A.R. 309.  Laycraft C.J.A. held that it
sufficed if ""the balancing of the factors favours transfer"" (p. 316).

 

    In
my view, for the more detailed reasons I have given in R. v. M.
(S.H.), the burden falls squarely on the applicant to persuade
the Youth Court that no solution other than transfer is appropriate in the
circumstances of a particular case.  To the extent that it relied on the lower
threshold of ""favouring transfer"", the Court of Appeal erred and that
error pervaded its assessment of the evidence relating to the elements to be considered
in s. 16.

 

II  -  Scope
of Review

 

    In
the Court of Queen's Bench, Veit J. exercised her statutory discretion to
review in a restrictive manner.  Commenting on the scope of review, she said:

 

    Although
the expressed options of confirming or reviewing the decision of the provincial
court make it clear that something more than a mere review of jurisdiction is
anticipated in this review, the scope of the appeal court's jurisdiction on
review is clearly not to review the matter de novo and is
presumably not so broad as to enable the review court to substitute its
discretion for that of the court being reviewed.  Assuming that there is no
challenge to the jurisdiction of the transfer hearing court, I am of the view
that the appeal court on review should interfere only if there has been an
error in law or a patently unreasonable result.

 

    The
Court of Appeal of Alberta, however, felt that it was ""bound to apply the
principles . . . that were expressed in Regina v. S.H.M."" 
For the court, McClung J.A. added that he ""fully agree[d]"" with these
principles:

 

    By
their explicit wording, these provisions [s. 16(9) and (10)] have recast the
customary standard of appellate review of interlocutory orders of this type. 
The appellate court is required to render the decision it concludes should have
been given. [Reference omitted.]

 

    In
my view, this is too broad an interpretation of the scope of appeal.  For the
reasons I gave in R. v. M. (S.H.), the discretion
which is conferred by s. 16(9) and (10) of the Act is not to be exercised in a
vacuum.  In light of s. 5, the general economy of the Act and the necessarily
incidental creation of a specialized body of decision-makers, paying due
tribute to curial deference in the Youth Court's area of expertise, the
discretion to confirm or reverse the decision of the Youth Court can be
exercised only in cases where there is a serious ground for intervention. 
Errors of fact as well as errors of law would constitute such serious grounds,
but the test is intended to allow a somewhat broader basis for review.  In some
cases, it could allow the discretion to review to be exercised where there is a
substantial discrepancy between the reviewing court's and the Youth Court's
assessment of the relevant factors.  

 

    I
now turn to the test for transfer to determine whether in this case there was
such a serious ground for intervention.

 

III  -  Test
for Transfer

 

    In
considering the elements listed in s. 16(2) in the case at bar, Hansen Prov.
Ct. J. first considered the element of seriousness.  She noted that ""[t]he
offence of first degree murder is one of the most serious offences under the
Criminal Code "".  Hansen Prov. Ct. J. then cited with approval a decision
of the Ontario Court of Appeal where the alleged commission of murder was
referred to as a ""weighty factor"" (R. v. Clements (1983),
5 C.C.C. (3d) 308, at p. 311).  She also appraised the circumstances, in
particular, the degree of violence and insensitivity of the murder.  Though urged
by the Crown to conclude that J.E.L.'s actions were premeditated, she found no
evidence in this respect:

 

The Crown has argued, however, that because the
strangulation occurred after the deceased was rendered unconscious or incapable
of protecting himself, the Court should infer that the murder was premeditated.

 

    There
is, however, no evidence of the degree, if any, of J.E.L.'s participation in
the strangulation and, accordingly, it is not possible for the Court to come to
any conclusion as to the degree of premeditation and violence on the part of
J.E.L.

 

    Veit
J., in the Court of Queen's Bench, considered the element of seriousness at
length.  She took note of the Youth Court judge's finding that there was no
evidence of premeditation.  In this respect, she indicated some approval for
the proposition that ""[t]he matter of premeditation is something to be
decided by the trier of fact at the hearing of the case, and not for the judge
at the hearing of the transfer application"" (R. v. C.R.M. (1986),
46 Man. R. (2d) 317, at p. 318).  Veit J. concluded as follows:

 

    In
summary on this issue, the learned trial judge explicitly recognized the
weightiness of the mere charge of first degree murder.  As to the circumstances
of the murder, she was entitled to consider the evidence led, to note the
absence of any evidence of premeditation, to weigh the frailty of the hearsay
evidence on the crucial issue of [J.E.L.]'s participation in the cruelty of the
strangulation as distinct from his involvement in the initial blow to the
victim's head, and to note the existence of potential provocation on the issue
of the danger of [J.E.L.] to society at large.

 

    In
the Court of Appeal, equal attention was given to this element of the
balancing, as McClung J.A. noted:

 

    Mr. Davies has urged that J.E.L.'s role in the
homicide is subsidiary to that of S.H.M.  Nonetheless, at its lowest level of
criminality, the case alleged against J.E.L. points to his participation in a
culpable homicide that was brutal, coordinated and mercantile.  There was
evidence that it was unregretted.

 

                                                                          .
. . 

 

This
homicide was not a crime of adolescent proportion.

 

    Other
than the use of more emphatic language in the Court of Appeal, it appears that
all courts below found that the element of seriousness of the alleged offence
and circumstances militated in favour of transfer.

 

    With
respect to s. 16(2)(b), Hansen Prov. Ct. J. found that J.E.L. was 17 years
and six months old at the time of the alleged offence.  She accepted the
evidence of Dr. Brooks, who this time had prepared a psychiatric assessment
report at the request of the youth, to the effect that J.E.L. is of average
intelligence and that his personality testing fell within normal limits. 
Hansen Prov. Ct. J. quoted from Dr. Brooks' report, which indicated ""a
mildly anti-social pattern with a tendency to anti-authority attitudes"".

 

    The
Crown adduced evidence through another psychiatrist, Dr. Blashko, who expressed
the view that J.E.L. suffers from a personality disorder.  However, Hansen
Prov. Ct. J. rejected that evidence:

 

    Dr. Blashko, in response to a lengthy hypothetical
question, was of the opinion that J.E.L. suffers from a personality disorder,
anti-social type, for which the prognosis is bleak.  While Dr. Blashko had
available to him, in formulating his opinion, a great deal of historical
information, he did not have the benefit of a clinical interview.

 

    Dr. Blashko indicated that in arriving at his
conclusion, he considered patterns of anti-social behaviour in J.E.L.'s history
but did not specifically relate the onset of the anti-social behaviour to the
death of J.E.L.'s father.

 

    I
am not satisfied on the evidence that J.E.L. falls within the limits of the
category of personality disorder, anti-social type, as described by Dr. Blashko. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

    With
respect to previous findings of guilt, the pre-disposition report indicates
that J.E.L. had one previous finding of guilt of theft over $200, contrary to
s. 294 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, and one finding of guilt of mischief contrary to s. 387 of the Code.

 

    These
prior convictions are not discussed in the reasons for judgment in the courts
below.  There is no further acknowledgement of the elements of age, character
and background in the Court of Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal. 
Accordingly, it must de assumed that the Court of Appeal did not disagree with
the analysis of Hansen Prov. Ct. J. on the element of s. 16(2)(b) in the
circumstances of this case.

 

    Turning
to the factors of adequacy under s. 16(2)(c) and
availability of resources under s. 16(2)(d),
Hansen Prov. Ct. J. noted:

 

    The maximum disposition under the Young Offenders
Act is three years secure custody.  Under the Criminal Code , the minimum
punishment for the offence of first degree murder is life imprisonment.  In
determining the adequacy of the Act, one must have regard to the degree of
accountability expected bearing in  mind the age, level of maturity and
development of the young person, together with seriousness and circumstances
surrounding the alleged offence.

 

    One must also consider that the primary goal when
dealing with a youthful offender is that of rehabilitation.  The Court must
determine whether a longer period of time than that provided for in the Young
Offenders Act having regard to the protection of society is necessary for the
rehabilitation of the young person.

 

    Dr.
Brooks was of the opinion that J.E.L. required a fairly long period of
individual and group psychotherapy about one year, which is well within the
statutory limits in Section 20 of the Young Offenders Act.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Hansen
Prov. Ct. J. indicated that she was satisfied that J.E.L. was amenable to
treatment when she cited the following portion of Dr. Brooks' report:

 

There is
a strong possibility that J.E.L. can re-establish relationships with somebody
on a close basis and if this occurs, he can abandon his anti-social ways.  With
this in mind, a fairly long period of individual and group psycho-therapy,
about one year, could achieve this end. 

 

    Hansen
Prov. Ct. J. suggested that J.E.L.'s case would not benefit from the same
likelihood of reformation in the adult system:

 

The Young Offender institutions are specifically
designed and staffed to meet the needs of young offenders.  In addition, within
the young offender system, there is a forensic unit at Alberta Hospital, which
has been established to meet the treatment needs of young offenders.  The
federal institutions are not designed to deal with young offenders.  While the
vocational training programs available to inmates in adult institutions may be
superior to those in young offender institutions, there are no special handling
units, nor is there individualized programming for young people.

 

    In
addition, having regard to the inmate culture in provincial and federal
institutions, there is always a long term risk that incarceration in an adult institution
could be detrimental to a young offender's development and ultimate
rehabilitation.

 

Later,
Hansen Prov. Ct. J. added:  ""he [J.E.L.] has not exhausted the young
offenders system and, in fact, there is a specific program within the youth
system designed to meet his treatment needs and hopefully affect his
rehabilitation . . .""

 

    In
the Court of Queen's Bench, Veit J. also noted the availability of facilities
suited to address J.E.L.'s treatment needs, stressing the ""explicit
psychiatric evidence that [J.E.L.] . . . was  amenable to treatment, and that a
program exists which can treat him"".  She concluded:

 

    Given
the explicit support of the psychiatrist for this program for this young
person, in total the learned trial judge has certainly not failed in her
appreciation of the evidence.

 

    There
was no discussion of this element in the Court of Appeal.  Accordingly, it must
be assumed that the court found no reason to disagree with Hansen Prov. Ct. J.
in her analysis of these elements in the circumstances of the present case.

 

    Pursuant
to s. 16(2)(e), Hansen Prov. Ct. J. then considered two other
elements which were urged by the Crown to be relevant.  First, the Crown
adduced evidence that J.E.L. escaped from the Youth Development Centre while
being held in respect of the charge of murder.  The crown urged the Court to
infer that the security system was inadequate to hold J.E.L.  Hansen Prov. Ct.
J. rejected this submission, noting: ""The possibility of escape is a
concern in all correctional institutions"".  There was no further
discussion of this submission in the courts below.  While evidence of escape
may be relevant to the overall assessment, as ultimately going to the societal
interest in being protected from dangerous criminals and also perhaps
indicating the youth's non amenability to treatment, it is open to the Youth
Court judge to consider such evidence in light of all the other evidence before
the court.  The second submission involved a letter allegedly written by J.E.L.
showing insensitivity and lack of remorse on his part.  This evidence was
rejected by the Youth Court judge:  

 

As
stated by Dr. Brooks, however, there is no way to determine whether this letter
is a true statement of lack of remorse and bragging or whether it is a means of
putting up a front for peers.

 

Authorship
of the letter was not proven, and even if it had been, the Youth Court judge
found, as a fact, that the letter could not be taken as establishing lack of
remorse.  Nevertheless, in the Court of Appeal, McClung J.A. observed: 
""There was evidence that it [the murder] was unregretted"".  It is
difficult to see how the Court of Appeal, in the absence of palpable mistake by
the court below, and not having had the benefit of Dr. Brooks' viva voce
testimony, could reverse the Youth Court's findings with respect to the letter.

 

    There
was an additional relevant element considered in the Court of Appeal which had
not been examined in the courts below.  McClung J.A. relied on the principle
that co-accused should be tried jointly.  He said:

 

It is a
consideration which cannot deny a young offender an individual assessment of
the justification for his transfer to the ordinary court but neither is it
irrelevant to the issues before the court.  Like cases should be treated alike.

 

    Some
cases have indeed considered that the treatment of co-accused is a relevant
consideration in an application for transfer.  For instance, under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, in the case of R. v.
Smith (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 368 (Man. C.A.), Hall J.A. wrote
at p. 371:

 

This was
a joint venture between the accused and his adult confederate.  If they are
tried by two different tribunals -- one in the juvenile Court, the other in
adult Court -- there is a danger of disparate conclusions being reached, as
well as the certainty of vastly different degrees of punishment being imposed,
if verdicts of guilt were reached.

 

In the
later case of R. v. E.S.R. (1985), 36 Man. R.
(2d) 276 (C.A.), Hall J.A. had an opportunity to explain his words in Smith.  He
said (at p. 279):

 

    In
my opinion the transfer of E. and the retention of W. [are] not necessarily
inconsistent.  Each accused must be viewed separately.  Both should be treated
the same if the circumstances warrant but that does not have to be the case. 
The decision of this court in R. v. Smith (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 368 was
not intended as a statement that transfer must always be ordered where the
co-accused of a young offender is to be tried in adult court.  It is only one
factor to be taken into account.  It was a particularly important factor in R.
v. Smith, (supra), but only because of the facts in that particular case.

 

    I
agree with these views.  Each case must be determined on its specific facts. 
Minor differences in the factual background of particular cases may result in
different conclusions respecting the propriety of transfer.  While the transfer
of a co-accused may be relevant, it is only a single element, one which must be
weighed in light of the other elements stated in s. 16(2).

 

    It
can readily be seen that the Court of Appeal expressed no serious disagreement
with the analysis of the Youth Court judge.  The sole difference between the
two courts lies in the taking into account by the Court of Appeal of the fact
that the accomplice, S.H.M., had been transferred to ordinary court. 
Considering the importance of the other elements in s. 16(2), which were not
discussed at any length in the reasons of McClung J.A., the Court of Appeal,
for no apparent reason, simply substituted its view for that of the Youth Court
in an area lying at the heart of that court's expertise.

 

    In
view of the scant discussion of the factors to be balanced and the comment of
McClung J.A. adopting the principles expressed in R. v. S.H.M., supra, one
cannot escape the impression that, at the end of the day, much reliance was put
on the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case.  In my view, this
is anything but the exercise of a fresh discretion as envisaged by the
legislation.

 

IV  -  Conclusion

 

    As
was the case in R. v. S.H.M., the Court of
Appeal found no error of fact or of law in the reasons of the Youth Division. 
Nor in my view did the Court of Appeal state any other serious ground for
intervention.  This was a case where the additional expertise of the Youth
Division and its privileged situation in assessing the expert testimony should
have prevailed over only minor differences of opinion in the Court of Appeal.

 

    As a
result, I would allow the appeal and quash the order to transfer J.E.L. to
ordinary court.  I would restore the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench
dismissing the appeal from the decision of the Youth Division.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
newfoundland

 

    Criminal
law -- Mens rea -- Wilful non-compliance with probation order -- Failure to
keep the peace and to be of good behaviour -- Charge arising because of
conviction of having care and control of vehicle while impaired -- Accused
believing vehicle could not be started -- Whether s. 666(1) an offence
requiring its own mens rea or one automatically following conviction for any
Criminal Code offence -- Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
ss. 19, 236(1), 663(2), 666(1), 722(1).

 

    Respondent,
who had been found sitting in an automobile apparently in an intoxicated state,
pleaded guilty to having the care and control of a motor vehicle while legally
impaired contrary to s. 236  of the Criminal Code .  An
information was sworn against him alleging that he ""did unlawfully and
wilfully fail to comply"" with a probation order which required him to
""keep the peace and be of good behaviour"".  The commission of the
offence under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  was the
basis relied on for the alleged breach of s. 666(1) .

 

    At his
trial for the s. 666(1)  offence, respondent testified that when he
committed the s. 236  offence he was unaware that he was breaking the law
because he believed that the car could not be started.  The trial judge noted
that there was evidence to support his belief and acquitted respondent of the
s. 666(1)  offence on the ground that he lacked the requisite mens rea.  An
appeal by the Crown by way of stated case before the Newfoundland Court of
Appeal was dismissed.  At issue here is whether s. 666(1)  of the Criminal
Code  is to be interpreted as an offence requiring its own mens rea or as
an offence which automatically follows upon a conviction for any Criminal
Code  offence or other deliberate act which constitutes a
violation of the conditions of a probation order.

 

    Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

    Section
666 requires a relatively high level of mens rea.  The
term ""wilfully"" denotes a relatively high level of mens rea
requiring persons on probation to have formed the intent to breach the terms of
the probation order and to have had that purpose in mind while doing so.  The
requirement of ""refusing"" to comply with a probation order also
denotes some form of guilty knowledge for it is necessary to know what is not
being complied with.  The fact that imprisonment may be imposed under
s. 722 of the Code for conviction under s. 666(1) 
too indicates a higher level of mens rea.

 

    The
purpose of s. 666(1)  is clearly to achieve compliance with probation
orders and the Code goes to great length to ensure that
the accused is fully aware of the terms of his or her probation order.  A
person can hardly be deterred from wrongdoing where he or she has no awareness
of doing anything wrong.  Persons who unknowingly violate the terms of their
parole should not be convicted.

 

    The mens rea of
s. 666(1)  requires that an accused intend to breach his probation order: 
the accused must have known that he was bound by the probation order and that
it contained a term which would be breached by his proposed conduct.  The mens rea of the
underlying offence cannot be treated as the intent required under
s. 666(1) .  The conviction for the underlying offence constitutes the actus reus under
s. 666(1)  and establishes that the accused violated the terms of his
parole.  That conviction is not prima facie evidence of an
intent to breach the probation order which is quite different from the
intention to commit the actus reus of the underlying offence.  Because
direct evidence is almost always difficult to obtain, the Crown may ask the court,
absent any evidence to the contrary, to infer intent from the fact of the
conduct but any doubt must resolved in favour of the accused.

 

    Section
19  of the Criminal Code  provides that
ignorance of the law is not an excuse for committing an offence.  Section
666(1) , however, constitutes an exception to the general rule expressed in
s. 19  in a case where the commission of a criminal offence is relied on as
the actus reus under the section.  Where knowledge is itself a
component of the requisite mens rea, the absence of knowledge provides a
good defence.

    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

    WILSON J. --
The sole issue to be resolved in this appeal is the requisite mens rea for the
offence of wilfully failing or refusing to comply with a probation order
contrary to s. 666(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34 (since renumbered s. 740(1) , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ).  More specifically,
this Court is asked to determine whether commission of a criminal offence by a
person required by his probation order to ""keep the peace and be of good
behaviour"" is sufficient to ground a breach of s. 666(1)  regardless of the
mental element required to sustain a conviction for the underlying offence.

 

1.  The
Facts

 

    On
October 27, 1984 the respondent was found sitting in an automobile apparently
in an intoxicated state.  The respondent was charged with and pleaded guilty to
an offence under s. 236  of the Criminal Code  of
having the care and control of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level of
over 80 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood.  On December 6, 1984 an information
was sworn against the respondent alleging that he ""did unlawfully and
wilfully fail to comply"" with a probation order issued against him on
February 23, 1983 requiring him to ""keep the peace and be of good
behaviour"".  The commission of the offence under s. 236  of the Criminal
Code  was the basis relied on for the alleged breach of s.
666(1) .

 

2.  The
Courts Below

 

    At
his trial for the s. 666(1) offence, the respondent testified before Chief
Judge Scott of the Provincial Court of Newfoundland that at the time he
committed the offence under s. 236  he was unaware that he was breaking the law
because he believed that the car could not be started.  The trial judge noted
that there was evidence to support his belief.  He acquitted the respondent on
the ground that he lacked the requisite mens rea to
sustain a conviction under s. 666(1).  In the course of his oral reasons, Chief
Judge Scott stated:

 

There are
a great many people and you may be one who feel that because a vehicle cannot
start and might have something mechanically wrong with it, that you are not
breaching the law.  For this Section to apply, this Section 666 for wilfully to
breach the law, you have to have a dishonest belief in your mind or acting with
a wrong intention that you intend to break the law.  I think its more than just
proving that the previous offence was pleaded guilty to or you were found
guilty of and I am rather inclined to agree with the judgment of the County
Court contrary to Crown Counsel here.  There are cases I believe where just
merely proving the previous act or omission would be sufficient and some of
them are pretty well some of the simpler areas of law.  Where you had an honest
belief, although you may be wrong, that you are not doing anything wrong could
be found wilfully guilty of a breach of probation, I think would be stretching
the law a little bit.

 

    An
appeal by the Crown by way of stated case before the Newfoundland Court of
Appeal was dismissed:  see (1988), 69 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 232.  Speaking for
the court (Mifflin, Gushue and Mahoney JJ.A.) Mifflin J.A. concluded that the
type of evidence supporting a conviction for a criminal offence would often,
although not always, provide ""prima facie evidence of
wilfulness"" but that this was not so in the case of the respondent's
conviction under s. 236 .  He stated at p. 233:

 

    In my view, this court cannot make a determination
the effect of which would be to preclude any defence to a charge of breaching a
probation order when an offence contrary to the Criminal Code  has been
proved.  Section 666(1)  does not have this effect.  If such were intended, s.
666(1)  would have so provided.  Section 666(1)  does not distinguish between
provisions in the probation order, be they general or specific, or offences
under the Criminal Code  or not. ""Wilfully"" is applicable to
all charges under that section.  This court does not intend to canvass all the
provisions in the Criminal Code  and determine whether or not the mens
rea required for each offence would be sufficient to satisfy the provisions of
""wilfully"" in s. 666(1)  in every case.  Moreover, it would be
injudicious for this court to speculate as to what particular defences could be
available to an accused in any particular case.

 

    The word ""wilfully"" in s. 666(1)  of the Criminal
Code  was interpreted in Shaver v. R., 4 B.C.L.R. 354.  At p. 357
Cashman, C.C.J., said:

 

    ""In my respectful view, the word `wilfully'
must mean that the act is done deliberately and intentionally and not by
accident or inadvertence.  Furthermore, the wilful act or refusal must relate
to the breach of his promise to keep the peace because the essence of the
offence created by s. 666(1)  is wilful, that is, deliberate, disobedience of a
probation order.""

 

    We do not accept the extreme proposition that
there must be a deliberate intention in the mind of an accused to breach the
probation order.  The intention may be inferred from the particular Criminal
Code  offence which triggered the charge for a breach of s. 666(1) .

 

    Speaking generally, it would appear that in many
prosecutions for a breach of s. 666(1) , triggered by a breach of the Criminal
Code , all that would be necessary to provide proof of wilfulness would be
evidence of the conviction.  The type of conduct itself which would ground a
conviction for many offences would provide prima facie evidence of wilfulness
and it is difficult to conceive of any defences thereto.

 

    To
answer the question in the case as stated, it is not possible for this court to
say that the trial judge was wrong in law when he found as a fact that the
respondent had a reasonable and honest belief that he was not breaking the law
when he did the illegal acts which led to his conviction on the s. 236(1)
charge and, therefore did not wilfully fail to comply with the probation
order.  [Emphasis added.]

 

3.  The
Relevant Legislation

 

    Section
666(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides:

 

    666.  (1) 
An accused who is bound by a probation order and who wilfully fails or refuses
to comply with that order is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

 

    Section
663(2)  of the Criminal Code  (now s. 737(2) )
sets out the mandatory terms of a probation order as well as those which may be
imposed in the court's discretion:

 

    663. ...

 

    (2)  The following conditions shall be deemed to be
prescribed in a probation order, namely, that the accused shall keep the
peace and be of good behaviour and shall appear before the court when
required to do so by the court, and, in addition, the court may prescribe as
conditions in a probation order that the accused shall do any one or more of
the following things as specified in the order, namely,

 

(a)  report to and be under the supervision of a probation
officer or other person designated by the court;

 

(b) provide for the support of his spouse or any other
dependants whom he is liable to support;

 

(c)  abstain from the consumption of alcohol either
absolutely or on such terms as the court may specify;

 

(d)  abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon;

 

(e)  make restitution or reparation to any person
aggrieved or injured by the commission of the offence for the actual loss or
damage sustained by that person as a result thereof;

 

(f)  remain within the jurisdiction of the court and
notify the court or the probation officer or other person designated under
paragraph (a) of any change in his address or his employment or
occupation;

 

(g)  make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable
employment; and

 

(h) 
comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable
for securing the good conduct of the accused and for preventing a repetition by
him of the same offence or the commission of other offences.  [Emphasis added.]

 

It
should be noted that subs. 663(2)(c) permits the court
to order an accused to abstain from alcohol.  No such condition was attached to
the respondent's probation.

 

    Section
663 contains no penalty provision so that the general penalty provision in the Criminal
Code  applies.  At the time of the offence, that provision
stated:

 

    722.  (1) 
Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, every one who is convicted of
an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more
than five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for six months or to both.

 

    The
respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of having the care or control of
a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08 contrary to s.
236(1) (now s. 253) even although he testified that he did not think he was
doing anything wrong at the time because he believed that the car was not in an
operating condition.  Section 236(1) provides as follows:

 

    236. (1)  Every one who drives a motor
vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion
or not, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof
in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is
guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction
and is liable

 

(a)  for a first offence, to a fine of not more than two
thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for six
months or to both;

 

(b)  for a second offence, to imprisonment for not more
than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

 

(c)  for
each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two years and not
less than three months.

 

    In Ford v.
The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 231, the majority of this Court
(Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting) held that an intention to drive was not
a required element of the offence of having care or control.  Writing for the
majority Ritchie J. stated at pp. 248-49:

 

    Nor,
in my opinion, is it necessary for the Crown to prove an intent to set the
vehicle in motion in order to procure a conviction on a charge under s. 236(1)
of having care or control of a motor vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such a
quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.  Care or control may be exercised without
such intent where an accused performs some act or series of acts involving the
use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred in this case,
whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating the danger
the section is designed to prevent.

 

    Ritchie
J.'s view was subsequently endorsed by a unanimous decision of this Court (per McIntyre
J.) in R. v. Toews, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119.  Since the offence consists of
having care or control and care or control is had by doing no more than
performing certain acts by which a vehicle may unintentionally be set in
motion, it is clear that the level of intent the Crown must prove to sustain a
conviction for this offence is minimal indeed.

 

4.  Analysis

 

    This
case raises the important question whether an accused can be convicted of the
summary conviction offence of wilfully breaching or refusing to comply with a
probation order when, in the words of the trial judge, the accused ""had an
honest belief, although you may be wrong, that you are not doing anything
wrong"".  In other words, is s. 666(1)  of the Criminal Code  to be
interpreted as an offence requiring its own mens rea or is
it to be interpreted as an offence which automatically follows upon a conviction
for any Criminal Code  offence or other deliberate act which constitutes a
violation of the conditions of a probation order?  The respondent's case is
particularly challenging in that the underlying Criminal Code 
offence, care or control of a motor vehicle ""over 80 mg."", was
committed without proof or admission of mens rea, at
least in the traditional sense.  The respondent was simply found sitting in an
intoxicated condition in a car which he thought (and the trial judge believed
him) would not start.  At his trial the respondent testified that he did not
think he was doing anything wrong and this seems to have been accepted as a
fact by the trial judge.

 

    The
issue in the case is primarily one of statutory interpretation.

 

(a)  The
Literal Interpretation

 

    Section
666(1)  is clearly framed so as to require guilty knowledge in order to
constitute a breach.  The section prohibits an accused from wilfully failing
or refusing to comply with a probation order.  The word
""wilfully"" is perhaps the archetypal word to denote a mens rea
requirement.  It stresses intention in relation to the achievement of a
purpose.  It can be contrasted with lesser forms of guilty knowledge such as
""negligently"" or even ""recklessly"".  In short, the use of
the word ""wilfully"" denotes a legislative concern for a relatively
high level of mens rea requiring those subject to the
probation order to have formed the intent to breach its terms and to have had
that purpose in mind while doing so.

 

    The
requirement of ""refusing"" to comply with a probation order, although
less obviously importing a mens rea element than the requirement of
wilfully failing to comply, also denotes some form of guilty knowledge.  In
order to ""refuse"" to comply with something it is necessary to know
what you are not complying with.  Only in that event can your actions
constitute a ""refusal"".  You know the strictures you are under but
deliberately flout them.

 

    I
would conclude therefore that on a literal construction of the section a
relatively high level of mens rea is required for the offence.

 

(b)  The
Contextual Interpretation

 

    Is
the requirement of a relatively high level of mens rea under
s. 666(1)  consistent with the wider context of the legislation?

 

    Since
s. 666(1) creates a criminal offence it should be presumed that some mental
element is required in the absence of clear words to the contrary.  In the case
of s. 666(1), far from having clear words to the contrary, we have clear words
denoting a mental element.  It would appear to be significant also in this
connection that the general punishment provision, s. 722  of the Criminal
Code , applies in the case of a conviction under s. 666(1) 
and under that section imprisonment is a permitted sanction.  Since s. 666(1)
creates an offence under the Code for which imprisonment is a permitted
sanction it makes eminent good sense, in my opinion, to construe it as
requiring a mental element.

 

    Moreover,
the purpose of s. 666(1) is clearly to achieve compliance with probation
orders.  Section 663(4) requires not only that a copy of the probation order be
given to the accused but also that it be read to him or her.  The accused must
also be told that breach of it constitutes a distinct offence under s. 666(1). 
Lower courts have held that the Crown must prove that this occurred before a
conviction can be obtained under the section: R v. Piche (1976),
31 C.C.C. (2d) 150 (Sask. Q.B.); R. v. McNamara (1982),
66 C.C.C. (2d) 24 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bara (1981), 58 C.C.C.
(2d) 243 (B.C.C.A.)  Indeed, the courts in R. v. Piche and R. v. Bara also
ruled that an accused is not ""bound by a probation order""
within the meaning of s. 666(1) unless and until the court has complied with s.
663(4).  Given the pains that Parliament has taken to ensure that the accused
is fully aware of the terms of his or her probation order, it would be strange
if an accused could be convicted under the section without knowing that he or
she was violating it.

 

    Other
considerations seem to be relevant to the contextual approach to the
interpretation of s. 666(1).  For example, in R. v. Sault Ste.
Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, Dickson J. suggested that the
deterrence rationale advanced in favour of absolute liability offences is in
most cases overblown.  Put simply, it makes little sense to think that a person
will be deterred from wrongdoing in situations where that person does not
believe and has no awareness that he or she is doing anything wrong.  The
appellant submitted to the Court, however, that the whole purpose of putting a
person found guilty of criminal conduct on probation is to ""heighten his
or her awareness of the consequences of criminal activity"".  I am sure
that is correct.  However, in the context of this case the conviction of the
accused under s. 666(1) would have little or no deterrent effect given (as was
accepted by the trial judge) that the accused did not know he was doing
anything wrong.  A decision requiring a distinct mens rea element
for the offence under s. 666(1) would not, in my view, undermine the
effectiveness of probation orders as the appellant alleges.  The requirement
that persons on probation keep the peace and be of good behaviour would still
apply to those wilfully breaching their parole.  It is, I think, consistent
with the overall content and purpose of the probation provisions in the Criminal
Code  that those who unknowingly violate the terms of their
parole not be convicted but only those who wilfully breach such terms or
deliberately refuse to obey them.

 

    I
believe that the submissions of the appellant are directed not so much at the
element of the offence under s. 666(1) but in support of a very broad reading
of the provision in the probation order to keep the peace and be of good
behaviour.  In R. v. Stone (1985), 22 C.C.C.
(3d) 249, Steele J. of the Newfoundland Supreme Court attempted to define the
terms ""keep the peace"" and ""be of good behaviour"" as found
in s. 663(2) .  In that case the appellant who was bound by a probation order
was acquitted by the provincial court judge of the Criminal Code  offence
of fraudulently obtaining food, essentially because he was too intoxicated to
form the necessary specific intent when he ordered the restaurant meal for
which he did not pay.  He was, however, convicted of breaching his probation
order on the ground that his conduct at the restaurant constituted a wilful
failure to be of good behaviour even if it did not amount to a criminal
offence.  On appeal by way of stated case to the Newfoundland Supreme Court,
Steele J. was asked to determine whether the trial judge had erred when he held
that the phrase

 

""To
Keep the Peace and Be of Good Behaviour"" not only includes a violation of
any penal statute, federal, provincial, or municipal, but also goes beyond them
in that the words are to be given their ordinary meaning.

 

Steele
J. dismissed the appeal.

 

    Steele
J. proceeded from the view, expressed at p. 255, that the two terms, ""keep
the peace"" and ""be of good behaviour"", impose ""separate and
distinct conditions though in certain circumstances may overlap"".  At page
256, he draws the following distinction:

 

    When
considering whether there has been a failure ""to keep the peace"", one
is conscious of public opinion and its perception of peace and good order and
what does or does not offend that nebulous standard.  If the issue is an
individual's good behaviour, the emphasis shifts to a more personal analysis of
his conduct.  A breach of an undertaking ""to keep the peace"" means a
disruption or the upsetting of public order whereas a breach of a bond ""to
be of good behaviour"" means some act or activity by an individual that
fails to meet the fanciful standard of conduct expected of all law-abiding and
decent citizens.  It is quite possible, as I have already said, that one can
fail to be of good behaviour yet not commit a breach of the peace.  It is
probably a matter of degree.  We are only concerned with the second aspect of
the statutory condition, namely, ""to be of good behaviour"".

 

    Steele
J. goes on to say at p. 257 that a conviction for breach of a federal,
provincial or municipal statute ""may be -- perhaps usually is -- but not
necessarily"" a failure to be of good behaviour.  Conversely, conduct which
does not violate any statute may nevertheless breach the condition to keep the
peace and be of good behaviour.  The accused in that case was found not to have
had the required intent for the underlying offence, i.e., the offence of
fraudulently obtaining food.  Nevertheless, his behaviour at the restaurant was
found to fall short of ""good behaviour"".  The stated case did not raise
the issue of the requisite mens rea for a wilful failure to comply with
the probationary condition to ""be of good behaviour"", and Steele J.
did not deal with it.  By upholding the conviction under s. 666(1), however, he
implicitly affirmed the trial judge's finding that the appellant had the
requisite mens rea for that offence.

 

(c)  The
Existing Jurisprudence Under s. 666(1)

 

    In Butkans v.
The Queen, [1972] 4 W.W.R. 262, Hewak Co. Ct. J., as he then was,
considered the significance of the word ""wilful"" in the context of s.
666(1) where an accused failed to pay restitution contrary to the terms of his
probation order.  He stated at p. 271:

 

    Applying
these principles and reasoning to the present case, the matter would have been
different had s. 666 of the Code eliminated the term ""wilful"" making
the failure to comply with the probation order an absolute liability without
the necessity of proving mens rea.  By using the term ""wilful"" and
giving that word its ordinary meaning, the proper inference, in my view, would
be that Parliament intended that something more than mere failure must be
proven before an accused could be convicted under that section of the Code.

 

    In R. v. Sugg (1986),
28 C.C.C. (3d) 569, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, also
considered the meaning of ""wilful"" in s. 666(1).  The appellant in
that case failed to pay the full amount of restitution required of him under
the terms of his probation order.  The trial judge found as a fact that the
accused was financially unable to pay the full amount although he could have
paid a larger instalment than he did.  The trial judge nevertheless found him
guilty of wilfully failing to pay the total amount of the restitution and
convicted him of a breach of probation contrary to s. 666(1).  The Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appeal Division, overturned the conviction.  Speaking on behalf
of the Court, Macdonald J.A. at p. 572 made the following comments about the
mental element in s. 666(1):

 

    Subsection (1) of s. 666  of the Criminal
Code  creates a full mens rea
offence.  Judge MacDonald found as a fact that the appellant was financially
unable to pay the amount of $3,500 by May 1, 1985, as directed by the probation
order.  I agree with counsel for the appellant that such finding is
incompatible with a wilful failure to make such payment.

 

    The
learned trial judge in finding that the appellant wilfully failed to comply
with the restitution provision of the probation order was obviously influenced
by the fact that in his opinion the appellant did not use his best efforts to
pay more than he did.  The charge however is that the appellant wilfully failed
to pay $3,500 as directed by the probation order by May 1, 1985, not that he
did not make a more substantial payment than he did.  Once Judge MacDonald
found as he did that the appellant simply could not pay $3,500 by May 1, 1985,
then, in my opinion, it could not be said that the appellant wilfully failed to
pay such amount.  What is missing is the requisite criminal intent.

 

    These
cases concerned breaches of specific provisions of a probation order where the actus reus of the
breach was clear and was not disputed but the presence of the required mens rea was. 
In the absence of the required mens rea a conviction could
not be entered.  It is noted that Steele J., in discussing s. 666(1) generally
in R. v. Stone, agreed that a mental element was required for an
offence under the section.  He stated at pp. 254-55:

 

    The
vital element for an offence under s. 666(1) is that the non-compliance,
disobedience or violation of the probation order be wilful.  The term
""wilful"" is used in the sense that the failure or refusal to comply
with the probation order was designed, intentional and not accidental or
involuntary; that the non-compliance was deliberate and with bad purpose either
to disobey or disregard the order; that there is no justifiable excuse; the
failure or refusal to comply with a probation order must be with evil intent or
bad motive or with  indifference to the consequences:  see Black's Law
Dictionary, 5th ed., p. 1434.  The term ""wilfully"" appearing in the
section means that trifling or idle neglect of a condition in a probation order
and nothing more is not the crime, as there must be the additional element of
wilfullness [sic] needed to constitute the offence.

 

    However,
as noted above, he did not expressly address the question whether the requisite mens rea for s.
666(1) was present on the facts in R. v. Stone.  It is
accordingly unclear how he reached the conclusion that the appellant was wilfully
breaching his parole when in his intoxicated state he ordered the meal for
which he did not pay.  It seems fairly clear, however, that whether specific conduct
falls short of the standard of good behaviour is one question and whether the
accused intentionally fell short of that standard for purposes of s.
666(1) is another.  The two questions, in my opinion, cannot be collapsed into
one so as to eliminate any mens rea requirement from the s. 666(1)
offence.

 

    I
believe that the judgment of Cashman Co. Ct. J. in Shaver v. The Queen (1977),
4 B.C.L.R. 354, illustrates the point.  In that case the court had to decide
whether the conduct of an accused in causing a disturbance constituted a wilful
breach of his undertaking to keep the peace when there was evidence indicating
that he was ""hysterical"" and had ""lost control of himself""
at the time of the incident.  At page 357 the learned judge stated:

 

    In
my respectful view, the word ""wilfully"" must mean that the act is
done deliberately and intentionally and not by accident or inadvertence. 
Furthermore, the wilful act or refusal must relate to the breach of his promise
to keep the peace because the essence of the offence created by s. 666(1) is
wilful, that is, deliberate, disobedience of a probation order.

 

In other
words, the court cannot enter a conviction under s. 666(1) on proof of the actus reus alone. 
The accused may by his conduct have fallen short of whatever objective standard
is required to be met in order to constitute keeping the peace but this by
itself is not enough.  An actual intent to breach the term of the probation
order must be established if a conviction is to be entered under s. 666(1).

 

    The
Newfoundland Court of Appeal seems in the present case to have rejected this
approach to the interpretation of s. 666(1).  Mifflin J.A., after quoting from
the decision of Cashman Co. Ct. J. in Shaver v. The Queen states
at p. 234:

 

    We do not accept the extreme proposition that there
must be a deliberate intention in the mind of an accused to breach the
probation order.  The intention may be inferred from the particular Criminal
Code  offence which triggered the charge for a breach of s. 666(1) .

 

    Speaking
generally, it would appear that in many prosecutions for a breach of s. 666(1),
triggered by a breach of the Criminal Code , all that would be necessary
to provide proof of wilfulness would be evidence of the conviction.  The
type of conduct itself which would ground a conviction for many offences would
provide prima facie evidence of wilfulness and it is difficult to conceive of
any defences thereto.  [Emphasis added.]

 

    With
respect, I must disagree with the Newfoundland Court of Appeal on this point.  The mens rea of an
underlying offence cannot, in my view, be treated as the intent required under
s. 666(1).  As I have stated earlier, the mens rea of s.
666(1) requires that an accused intend to breach his probation order.  This
requires at a minimum proof that the accused knew that he was bound by the
probation order and that there was a term in it which would be breached by his
proposed conduct.  The accused must be found to have gone ahead and engaged in
the conduct regardless.  The onus, of course, is on the Crown to prove that the
accused had the requisite mens rea.  To the extent that direct evidence
of intent is almost always difficult to obtain, the Crown may ask the court,
absent any evidence to the contrary, to infer intent from the fact of the conduct. 
Any doubt, however, as to whether the accused intended to do what he did must
be resolved in favour of the accused.  The important point is that an intent to
commit the underlying offence does not afford a basis for inferring the wholly
distinct intent i.e. to breach one's probation order.

 

    What
then is the significance of the conviction for the underlying offence in
relation to the undertaking in the probation order to be of good behaviour?  It
seems to me that it constitutes the actus reus under s. 666(1). 
It establishes that the accused has violated the terms of his parole through
the commission of a criminal offence.  But it is not, in my view, prima
facie evidence of an intent to do so, still less a wilful
intent to do so.  This is a different intention from the intention to commit
the actus reus of the underlying offence.

 

    A
full mens rea offence under the Criminal Code  demands
that the accused have an intent to perform the acts that constitute the actus reus of the
offence.  Section 666(1)  is no different.  In the circumstances of the present
case the actus reus of the offence under s. 666(1)  is the
commission of the criminal offence under s. 236 .  Proof of the mens rea would
therefore require that the respondent intended to commit the criminal
offence under s. 236  when he sat behind the wheel in an intoxicated
condition.  The respondent testified that he thought the automobile was not in
an operating condition and for that reason he honestly believed he was not
committing an offence by sitting behind the wheel while intoxicated.  This
testimony was accepted by the trial judge.  In my view, where the actus reus of s.
666(1)  consists of the commission of a criminal offence, an honest belief on
the part of the accused that he is not committing that offence means that the
accused cannot be said to have wilfully failed or refused to
comply with the probation order.  He did not in these circumstances have the
necessary mens rea for the offence under s. 666(1) .

 

    Having
concluded that the conviction for the underlying offence will constitute the actus reus of the
offence under s. 666(1), I emphasize that the elements comprising the actus reus and mens rea of the
underlying offence are not open to dispute by the accused in defence of the
charge under s. 666(1).  For example, if an accused is convicted of sexual
assault under s. 265  of the Criminal Code , a judge presiding
over his trial for breach of probation must take it as given that the accused
had the requisite mens rea when he committed the actus reus of the
s. 265  offence.  This would include an intent to commit the assault without the
consent of the victim.  Where the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent has been rejected either explicitly or impliedly at the trial for the
offence of sexual assault (as it must have been if the accused was convicted),
the accused cannot argue at his trial for breach of probation that he did not
intend to commit the offence under s. 265  because he honestly believed that the
victim was consenting.

 

    Does
s. 19 of the Criminal Code  prevent the
respondent from relying on his honest belief to negate the mens rea
requirement in s. 666(1) ?  The section provides:

 

    19.
Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an excuse for
committing that offence.

 

    The
respondent testified that he did not believe he was doing anything wrong when
he got behind the wheel of the car while in an intoxicated condition.  The
trial judge accepted that the respondent's belief was honestly held and noted
the existence of objective evidence in support of his contention.

 

    It
is beyond dispute that the respondent could not escape conviction for a
violation of s. 236  of the Criminal Code  on the ground that
he did not know that having care and control of a motor vehicle with a blood
alcohol level over .08 was against the law.  That knowledge is not a component
of the mens rea of s. 236 .  Neither could the respondent claim that he
did not know that a wilful failure to be of good behaviour was a breach of
probation, especially since s. 663(4)  (now s. 737(3) ) of the Criminal
Code  requires a court when it issues a probation order to
ensure that the accused knows the terms and conditions of the order, the
conduct that would constitute a breach and the consequences of such a breach
and the respondent has not alleged that this was not done.

 

    Mewett
and Manning in their text, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985)
discuss at p. 320 what is meant by the maxim ignorance of the law is no excuse:

 

    It
is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse and as a general maxim --
now incorporated in s. 19 of the Code -- it is a harmless cliché.  It is more
accurate, however, to say that knowledge that one's act is contrary to the law
is not one of the elements of the requisite mens rea and
hence a mistake as to what the law is does not operate as a defence.  That is
to say, this belief that an act is lawful, however much it might affect
sentence, does not affect liability.

 

    While
I agree with the authors' general proposition I believe that where the
commission of a criminal offence is relied on as the actus reus of the
offence under s. 666(1) (as in this case), knowledge that one's act is contrary
to law (in this case, the law contained in s. 236  of the Criminal
Code ) is an element of the requisite mens rea of
wilfully failing to comply with a probation order.  I believe, in other words,
that s. 666(1)  constitutes an exception to the general rule expressed in s. 19 
in a case where the commission of a criminal offence is relied on as the actus reus under
the section.  An accused cannot have wilfully breached his probation order
through the commission of a criminal offence unless he knew that what he did
constituted a criminal offence.  However, the conviction is evidence of the mens rea under
s. 666(1)  only to the extent that wilfulness can be inferred from the actus reus as
indicated above.  Such mens rea must be proved and s. 19  of the Criminal
Code  does not preclude the respondent from relying on his
honest belief that he was not doing anything wrong to negate its presence. 
Where knowledge is itself a component of the requisite mens rea, the absence
of knowledge provides a good defence.

 

    I
would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Theft and fraud of information ‑‑ Hotel employee
contacted by accused to obtain the names, addresses and telephone numbers of
hotel employees ‑‑ Information sought confidential to the hotel ‑‑
Whether accused's conduct constitutes counselling theft or fraud ‑‑
Whether ""anything"" in s. 283(1) of the Criminal Code includes
confidential information ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
ss. 283(1), 338(1).

 

                   The
accused was hired to obtain the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the
hotel's employees by someone he assumed was associated with a union seeking to
organize the employees of that hotel. The accused contacted a security guard at
the hotel and offered him money for that information. According to the agreed
statement of facts, no physical object would have been taken had the scheme
been carried out. The security guard was not authorized to access the personnel
files, payroll print‑outs or any hotel record and knew that the hotel had
refused to divulge that information, considered confidential, to the union. The
security guard reported the incident and the accused was charged with
counselling a hotel employee to commit fraud and theft of information. He was
acquitted at trial, but on appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal
and entered a conviction on the charge of counselling the indictable offence of
theft. This appeal is to determine (1) whether confidential information can be
the object of theft under s. 283(1)  of the Criminal Code ; and (2)
whether the appropriation of the information would have amounted to fraud contrary
to s. 338(1) of the Code?

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   This
case does not deal with the theft of a list or any other tangible object
containing confidential information, but with the theft of confidential
information per se, a pure intangible. Although the word
""anything"" is not in itself a bar to including any intangible,
whatever its nature, its meaning must be determined within the context of s.
283(1) of the Code. The wording of that section restricts the meaning of
""anything"" in two ways: first, whether tangible or intangible,
""anything"" must be of a nature such that it can be the subject of a
proprietary right; and second, the property must be capable of being taken or
converted in a manner that results in the deprivation of the victim.
Confidential information does not fall within that definition. Confidential
information does not qualify as property for the purposes of s. 283 of the Code.
If protection is warranted for such information, it should be granted through
legislative enactment and not through the extension of the concept of property
or of the scope of the theft provision under the Code. Further, except
in very unusual circumstances, confidential information is not of a nature such
that it can be taken or converted. Information per se cannot be the
subject of a taking. As for conversion, if one appropriates confidential
information without taking a physical object evidencing it, the alleged owner
is not deprived of the use or possession of the information but only of the
confidentiality thereof. Since there is no deprivation, there can be no
conversion. Confidentiality cannot be the subject of theft because it does not
fall within the meaning of ""anything"" in s. 283(1) .

 

                   The
unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted information, like the employer's list,
constitutes an infringement of copyright under s. 17  of the Copyright Act 
but does not constitute theft under the criminal law. The rights provided in
the Copyright Act  cannot be taken or converted as their owner would
never suffer deprivation.

 

                   The
accused's conduct did not amount to fraud. The element of ""defraud""
in s. 338(1) of the Code is established by proving a dishonest
deprivation. The proof of a risk of prejudice to the economic interests of the
victim is sufficient evidence of the deprivation; actual economic loss is not
essential. In this case, the appropriation of information would not have
resulted in a risk of economic loss amounting to deprivation. The hotel had no
intention of dealing in a commercial way with the confidential information. The
hotel would not have been defrauded of money or of any economic advantage; all
that it stood to lose was the confidentiality of the information.

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                       Lamer J.‑‑While
one can steal a document containing confidential information, does obtaining
without authorization the confidential information, by copying the document or
memorizing its content, constitute theft? Is it fraud? The appellant was
charged in the Supreme Court of Ontario with the following three counts:

 

...that he, during the month of October, 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, did counsel Jan William
Hart to commit the indictable offence of fraud, an offence as described in
Section 338  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, contrary to Section 422  of the
Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

...that he, during the month of October, 1981 at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, unlawfully did counsel
Jan William Hart to commit the indictable offence of theft, an offence as
described in Section 294  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, to wit: to steal
information, the property of the Constellation Hotel and its employees, of a
value exceeding $200.00 contrary to Section 422  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

...that he, during the month of October, 1981 at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, unlawfully did counsel
Jan William Hart to commit the indictable offence of mischief to the private
property of the Constellation Hotel and its employees, which mischief exceeded
$50.00, an offence as described in Section 387(4)  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada, contrary to Section 422  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

2.                       The
events giving rise to these charges can be summarized succinctly. A union
attempting to organize the approximately 600 employees of the Constellation
Hotel, in Toronto, was unable to obtain the names, addresses and telephone
numbers of the employees because of a hotel policy that such information be
treated as confidential. The employer also barred union representatives from
the premises. The appellant, Wayne John Stewart, a self‑employed consultant,
was hired by somebody he assumed to be acting for the union to obtain the names
and addresses of the employees. Stewart offered a security guard at the hotel a
fee to obtain this information. The security guard, at all relevant times, had
not been authorized by any of the appropriate people nor did he have any
consent or right whatsoever to access the personnel files, payroll print‑outs
or any hotel record whatsoever for names, addresses or telephone numbers of
employees and knew that the hotel refused to divulge any such information to
the union, its representatives and agents and the appellant surmised this to be
the situation. I should like to make it very clear at the outset of this
opinion that we are not here dealing with an attempt to obtain a physical
object. This case was argued throughout on an agreed statement of facts, in
which it was agreed that no tangible object, such as a list containing the
information sought, would have been taken had the scheme been carried out. The
security guard reported the offer to his security chief and the police; as a
result, a subsequent telephone conversation between Hart and Stewart was
recorded, and Stewart was indicted as listed above. He elected trial by judge
alone and was acquitted on all three counts.

 

3.                       As
the Crown did not appeal the acquittal on the count of counselling mischief, I
will not refer to the legislation relevant to that count nor will I summarize
the trial judge's reasons in that regard.

 

Judgments

 

4.                       The
parties having submitted an agreed statement of facts, the trial turned on the
legal issue of whether what Mr. Hart was asked to do amounted to fraud, theft
or mischief. On the theft charge the Crown argued that the definition in s.
283(1)  of the Criminal Code ‑‑""anything whether animate
or inanimate""‑‑does not require that the subject of theft be
property; alternatively, if ""anything"" had to be property, then
confidential information was property. Krever J. adopted the approach in R.
v. Scallen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 441 (B.C.C.A.), which dealt with s.
283(1)  and which held that while ""anything"" need not be material and
could be an intangible, it had to be property of some kind: (1982), 38 O.R.
(2d) 84.

 

5.                       Krever
J. also rejected the Crown's alternative submission that confidential
information was property. Canadian, British and some American cases were cited
as denying that proposition in a criminal context, and American decisions
supporting it were distinguished because they interpreted legislation that
aimed at the protection of much broader values than common law concepts of
property. He added that if his interpretation was thought inadequate to meet
the needs of modern society, the remedy must be a change in the law by
Parliament.

 

6.                       On
the charge of counselling to commit fraud Krever J. applied R. v. Olan,
[1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, which established that s. 338(1) of the Code
requires proof of ""dishonesty"" and ""deprivation"". The
element of dishonesty was clearly made out, but s. 338(1) specifies deprivation
of ""property, money or valuable security"". The last was clearly
inapplicable, and the first ruled out by the decision on the theft charge. The
Crown argued that the hotel had been deprived of money because it could
potentially make a profit should it choose to sell the list of employees' names
and addresses. Krever J. rejected this submission as artificial, because the
undertaking by the hotel to maintain the confidentiality of the employees'
information entirely negated that suggestion. In the absence of the element of
deprivation, there is no fraud. Krever J. found the accused not guilty on all
counts.

 

7.                       On
appeal, Houlden J.A. set aside the verdict of acquittal and entered a
conviction on the charge of counselling the indictable offence of theft:
(1983), 42 O.R. (2d) 225. He applied R. v. Scallen, supra, to the
effect that the word ""anything"" in s. 283(1)  has a broad meaning,
wider in scope than the expression ""anything capable of being
stolen"". Accepting Krever J.'s interpretation of s. 283(1)  that
""anything"" must be capable of being property, Houlden J.A. was of the
opinion that confidential information gathered through the expenditure of time,
effort and money by a commercial enterprise for the purposes of its business
should be regarded as property and entitled to the protection of the criminal
law. He supported this position by reference to the definition of property in
the Code and to a number of English and American civil cases recognizing
confidential information to be property. In Houlden J.A.'s view, if a thing is
property for the purposes of civil law, it follows that it is also property
under the criminal law. Houlden J.A. added that, for a conviction under s.
283(1) , not only is it necessary to prove that the accused ""took or
converted anything whether animate or inanimate"", but it is also necessary
to establish that the accused possessed one of the intents set out in paras. (a)
to (d) of s. 283. Houlden J.A. found that, had Hart appropriated the
information as requested, the hotel would still have had the information, but
its character of confidentiality would have been lost. Therefore, in Houlden
J.A.'s opinion, Hart would have had the intent described in s. 283(1) (d):
he would have intended to deal with the information in such a manner that it
would not be returned in the condition it was in at the time it was taken or
converted. Houlden J.A. thus held that when the appellant counselled Hart to
obtain the information without authorization, he was guilty of counselling the
commission of the offence of theft.

 

8.                       Houlden
J.A. then dealt with the charge of counselling the commission of fraud. Unlike
section 283(1), s. 338 specifically refers to ""property"". Houlden
J.A. held that if information is property under the theft section, it is also
property for the purposes of the fraud section. In his view, the appropriation
of the information would have caused a risk of prejudice to the hotel's
economic interests, since promotional groups had approached the hotel to obtain
the list of names and addresses of the employees. The deprivation necessary to
prove the element of ""defraud"" in s. 338(1) was therefore present and
sufficient. Houlden J.A. thus found appellant guilty of counselling the
commission of fraud. However, applying the Kienapple rule, he entered no
conviction on this count.

 

9.                       Cory
J.A. concurred with Houlden J.A. but expressed additional reasons for finding
that confidential information is property for the purposes of criminal law. In
his view, information and its collection, collation and interpretation are
vital to most modern enterprises and may be their most valuable asset. Cory
J.A. cited American cases that support the conclusion that information is
property. These decisions held that copying paper and removing the copies was
as much an act of theft as the surreptitious removal of the original papers
would be.

 

10.                     Moreover,
Cory J.A. stated that even if information per se is not property, there
remains a right of property in confidential information. In Cory J.A.'s
opinion, this right, now protected by the provisions of the Copyright Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑30, falls within the definition of property contained
in s. 283(1). He then held that, in the case at bar, the list of the hotel
employees represents an unpublished literary work to which copyright attaches.
The hotel thus has the exclusive right to reproduce copies of the list and has
the corollary right to restrain others from so doing. Cory J.A. therefore
concluded that copyright constitutes property of a nature that falls within the
scope of s. 283(1), but he stressed that such compilations will only be capable
of being stolen if they are confidential.

 

11.                     In
a dissent, Lacourcière J.A. supported the findings of the trial judge. He
stated that appellate decisions have restricted the application of the word
""anything"" to cases involving ""property"" whether corporeal
or incorporeal. That assertion is supported by reference to the requisite
intent set out in paras. (a) to (d) of s. 283(1). In his opinion,
the proposition that confidential information can be the subject of proprietary
rights is correct to the extent only that a court of equity will restrain the
improper transmission or use of confidential information surreptitiously
obtained. Cases containing dicta to the effect that confidential information
may be described as property are not helpful when considering whether it can be
obtained by the commission of a theft.

 

12.                     After
much consideration, Lacourcière J.A. felt bound to agree that the word
""anything"" in s. 283 must be defined and qualified within the context
of property and that confidential information does not properly fit within that
context. Like Krever J., he was of the opinion that it is for Parliament to
broaden the criminal definition of property if the needs of modern Canadian
society require it.

 

13.                     As
for the count of fraud, Lacourcière J.A. held that confidential information is
clearly not money or valuable security, and that it is not property within the
meaning of s. 338(1) of the Code. Furthermore, the hotel conceded that
it had no intention to deal in a commercial way with the information; it would
thus not have suffered the requisite deprivation or detriment which is an
essential element of fraud. Lacourcière J.A. was of the view that the accused's
conduct did not amount to the offence of counselling fraud.

 

 

 

The Issues

 

14.                     On
the facts of this appeal the following questions are raised:

 

1.                Can
confidential information be the subject of theft under s. 283(1)  of the Criminal
Code ?

 

2.                Would
the appropriation of the information have amounted to fraud contrary to s.
338(1)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

15.                     Before
this Court, the Crown adopted the majority's reasoning in the Court of Appeal
and would answer the questions in the affirmative.

 

                                                                     I

 

Theft

 

16.                     Section
283(1)  of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

 

                   283. (1) Every
one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or
fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of
another person, anything whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

 

(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it
or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of
his property or interest in it,

 

(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security,

 

(c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its
return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform, or

 

(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be
restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.

 

17.                     In
order to be convicted of theft, one has to take or convert ""anything
whether animate or inanimate"" with the requisite intent as described in
paras. (a) to (d). To determine whether confidential information
can be the object of theft, the meaning of ""anything"" must be
ascertained. The word ""anything"" is very comprehensive and is not in
itself restricted in any way. As such it could include both tangible things and
intangibles. Appellant contends that the offence of theft contemplates only
physical objects. Under Canadian law as it now stands, however,
""anything"" has been held to encompass certain choses in action, which
are intangibles. In R. v. Scallen, supra, the accused was
convicted on a charge of theft of credit in a financial institution. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal held that bank credit was included in
""anything"" under s. 283(1)  (at p. 473):

 

                   I see no reason to construe ""anything"" in
s. 283(1)  with stress on ""thing"", and I think the word should be
construed in its broad sense and to mean exactly what it says, that theft can
be committed of ""anything"" that was property. That would include a
bank credit in a bank account‑‑which any normal person having one
would describe by saying that ""he had money in the bank"". I think it
would be difficult to convince him otherwise, even if in strict domestic law
all he had was the right to draw money from the bank in cash, by banknotes, by
cheque or by transfers elsewhere.

 

18.                     The
reasoning in Scallen, with which I am in agreement, was followed in R.
v. Hardy (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 73 (B.C.C.A.) Since certain choses in
action can be the subject of theft, what must be decided for the purpose of
this appeal is whether intangibles other than choses in action are to be
included in the word ""anything"".

 

19.                     In
R. v. Offley (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the Alberta Court of Appeal was
of the view that information, even when qualified as confidential, is not
""anything"" within the meaning of s. 283(1) , because it is
intrinsically incapable of being an inanimate thing. In that case, the accused
offered money to a police officer to run security checks for him on job
applicants through the Canadian Police Information Center, knowing that this
information was available only to law enforcement agencies. As in the case
before us, he was charged with counselling theft of information. The Alberta
Court of Appeal disagreed with the majority decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal in the case at bar and acquitted the accused.

 

20.                     We
are here dealing not with the theft of a list or any other tangible object
containing confidential information, but with the theft of confidential
information per se, a pure intangible. As mentioned earlier, the
assumption that no tangible object would have been taken was part of the agreed
statement of facts, and the case was argued throughout on that basis. The word
""anything"" is not in itself a bar to including any intangible, whatever
its nature. However, its meaning must be determined within the context of s.
283 of the Code. Indeed, while sexual intercourse was found to be
included in ""anything"" within the meaning of the extortion provision
(R. v. Bird, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 340 (B.C.C.A.)), it does not necessarily
follow that the same must be found under our law of theft.

 

21.                     In
my view, the wording of s. 283 restricts the meaning of ""anything"" in
two ways. First, whether tangible or intangible, ""anything"" must be
of a nature such that it can be the subject of a proprietary right. Second, the
property must be capable of being taken or converted in a manner that results
in the deprivation of the victim.

 

22.                     With
respect to the first restriction, the courts below have decided the case on the
assumption that ""anything"" has to be property. While appellant's
counsel takes issue with the relevancy of this qualification, I am of the view
that such qualification is proper. In my opinion, it is clear that to be the
object of theft, ""anything"" must be property in the sense that to be
stolen, it has to belong in some way to someone. For instance, no conviction
for theft would arise out of a taking or converting of the air that we breathe,
because air is not property.

 

23.                     It
can be argued‑‑as Professor Weinrib does in ""Information and
Property"" (1988), 38 U.T.L.J. 117‑‑that confidential
information is property for the purposes of civil law. Indeed, it possesses
many of the characteristics of other forms of property: for example, a trade
secret, which is a particular kind of confidential information, can be sold,
licensed or bequeathed, it can be the subject of a trust or passed to a trustee
in bankruptcy. In the commercial field, there are reasons to grant some form of
protection to the possessor of confidential information: it is the product of
labour, skill and expenditure, and its unauthorized use would undermine
productive efforts which ought to be encouraged. As the term
""property"" is simply a reference to the cluster of rights assigned to
the owner, this protection could be given in the form of proprietary rights.
The cases demonstrate that English and Canadian civil law protect confidential information.
However, the legal basis for doing so has not been clearly established by the
courts. Some cases have treated confidential information as property, and thus
have entitled the owner to exclude others from the use thereof: Aas v.
Benham, [1891] 2 Ch. 244 (C.A.); Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Gregory &
Co., [1896] 1 Q.B. 147 (C.A.); Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Central News
Ltd., [1897] 2 Ch. 48; Exchange Telegraph Co. v. Howard (1906), 22
T.L.R. 375 (Ch. Div.) On the other hand, the courts have recognized certain
rights with respect to confidential information in the guise of an equitable
obligation of good faith: Peter Pan Manufacturing Corp. v. Corsets
Silhouette Ltd., [1963] 3 All E.R. 402 (Ch. Div.); Saltman Engineering
Co. v. Campbell Engineering Co., [1963] 3 All E.R. 413n (C.A.); Argyll
v. Argyll, [1965] 2 W.L.R. 790 (Ch. Div.); Pre‑Cam Exploration
& Development Ltd. v. McTavish, [1966] S.C.R. 551; Seager v. Copydex
Ltd., [1967] 2 All E.R. 415 (C.A.); Boardman v. Phipps, [1967] 2
A.C. 47 (H.L.); Fraser v. Evans, [1968] 3 W.L.R. 1172 (C.A.)

 

24.                     It
appears that the protection afforded to confidential information in most civil
cases arises more from an obligation of good faith or a fiduciary relationship
than from a proprietary interest. No Canadian court has so far conclusively
decided that confidential information is property, with all the civil
consequences that such a finding would entail. The case law is therefore of little
assistance to us in the present case.

 

25.                     It
is possible that, with time, confidential information will come to be
considered as property in the civil law or even be granted special legal
protection by statutory enactment. Even if confidential information were to be
considered as property under civil law, it does not however automatically
follow that it qualifies as property for the purposes of criminal law.
Conversely, the fact that something is not property under civil law is likewise
not conclusive for the purpose of criminal law. Whether or not confidential
information is property under the Criminal Code  should be decided in the
perspective of the criminal law.

 

26.                     In
Oxford v. Moss (1978), 68 Cr. App. R. 183, the Divisional Court had to
decide whether confidential information was ""intangible property"" for
the purposes of the Theft Act 1968. A student was accused of stealing an
examination paper that he hoped to return without being detected. After
considering a number of civil authorities dealing with the subject of
confidential information, Smith J. wrote (at pp. 185‑86):

 

                   Those are cases concerned with what is described as
the duty to be of good faith. They are clear illustrations of the proposition
that, if a person obtains information which is given to him in confidence and
then sets out to take an unfair advantage of it, the courts will restrain him
by way of an order of injunction or will condemn him in damages if an
injunction is found to be inappropriate. It seems to me, speaking for my part,
that they are of little assistance in the present situation in which we have to
consider whether there is property in the information which is capable of being
the subject of a charge of theft. In my judgment, it is clear that the answer
to that question must be no.

 

27.                     In
civil law, the characterization of something as property triggers a series of
legal consequences. That characterization has the same effect under the criminal
law, although the consequences are somewhat different. If confidential
information is considered as property for the purposes of the theft section,
other sections of the Criminal Code  relating to offences against
property may also apply: ss. 27  (use of force to prevent commission of
offence), 38 (defence of movable property), 39 (defence with claim of right),
302 (robbery), 312 (possession of property obtained by crime), 350 (disposal of
property to defraud creditors), 616 (restitution of property), 653
(compensation for loss of property) and 654 (compensation to bona fide
purchasers). For example, let us assume a person obtains confidential
information by the commission of a crime, such as theft if it were possible.
If, after having memorized the information, that person is incapable of erasing
it from his memory, he could, one might argue, be charged with an offence under
s. 312  of the Criminal Code  for each day that he is unable to forget the
information.

 

28.                     Furthermore,
the qualification of confidential information as property must be done in each
case by examining the purposes and context of the civil and criminal law. It is
understandable that one who possesses valuable information would want to
protect it from unauthorized use and reproduction. In civil litigation, this
protection can be afforded by the courts because they simply have to balance
the interests of the parties involved. However criminal law is designed to
prevent wrongs against society as a whole. From a social point of view, whether
confidential information should be protected requires a weighing of interests
much broader than those of the parties involved. As opposed to the alleged
owner of the information, society's best advantage may well be to favour the
free flow of information and greater accessibility by all. Would society be
willing to prosecute the person who discloses to the public a cure for cancer,
although its discoverer wanted to keep it confidential?

 

29.                     The
criminalization of certain types of conduct should not be done lightly. If the
unauthorized appropriation of confidential information becomes a criminal
offence, there would be far reaching consequences that the courts are not in a
position to contemplate. For instance, the existence of such an offence would
have serious implications with respect to the mobility of labour. In
""Theft of Information"" (1984), 100 L.Q.R. 252, Hammond points
out (at p. 260) the problem that would follow:

 

[W]hat is significant for present purposes about the traditional civil
law formulations with respect to such [employee] covenants is that,
notwithstanding their difficulties of application, they do allow a balance to
be struck in particular cases between the various interests at stake. The
criminal law on the other hand allocates responsibility in black and white
terms. There is either an offence or there is not. Every employee who leaves a
position in Canada now faces criminal sanctions if he misjudges a line which
judges have had enormous difficulty in drawing in civil law cases.

 

30.                     This
indirect restriction on the mobility of labour is only one of the many
undesirable consequences that could result from a hasty extension of criminal
provisions by qualifying confidential information as property.

 

31.                     Moreover,
because of the inherent nature of information, treating confidential
information as property simpliciter for the purposes of the law of theft
would create a host of practical problems. For instance, what is the precise
definition of ""confidential information""? Is confidentiality based on
the alleged owner's intent or on some objective criteria? At what point does
information cease to be confidential and would it therefore fall outside the
scope of the criminal law? Should only confidential information be protected
under the criminal law, or any type of information deemed to be of some
commercial value? I am of the view that, given recent technological
developments, confidential information, and in some instances, information of a
commercial value, is in need of some protection through our criminal law. Be
that as it may, in my opinion, the extent to which this should be done and the manner
in which it should be done are best left to be determined by Parliament rather
than by the courts.

 

32.                     Indeed,
the realm of information must be approached in a comprehensive way, taking into
account the competing interests in the free flow of information and in one's
right to confidentiality or again, one's economic interests in certain kinds of
information. The choices to be made rest upon political judgments that, in my
view, are matters of legislative action and not of judicial decision.
Illustrative of this is the complexity of the schemes suggested to legislatures
and Parliaments by the various reform agencies in this country, the United
Kingdom and the United States (v.g. Institute of Law Research and
Reform, Report No. 46, Trade Secrets, July 1986).

 

33.                     For
these reasons, I am of the opinion that, as a matter of policy, confidential
information should not be property for the purposes of s. 283 of the Code.
To the extent that protection is warranted for confidential information, it
should be granted through legislative enactment and not through judicial
extension of the concept of property or of the scope of the theft provision
under the Criminal Code .

 

34.                     Although
this conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the appeal on the charge of
counselling theft, I will also consider the second restriction to the scope of
the word ""anything"", that is, that property must be capable of being
taken or converted in a manner that results in the deprivation of the victim.
Tangible things present no difficulty in this regard, as it is easy to conceive
how they can be both taken and converted. On the other hand, pure intangibles,
as they have no physical existence, can obviously only be converted, not taken.
The ""taking"" of an intangible could only occur where such intangible
is embodied in a tangible object, for example a cheque, a share certificate or
a list containing information. However, that would not result in the taking of
the intangible per se, but rather of the physical object evidencing it.

 

35.                     The
question is thus whether confidential information is of a nature such that it
can be taken or converted. In my opinion, except in very rare and highly
unusual circumstances, it is not. As we have seen, information per se
cannot be the subject of a taking. As for conversion, it is defined as an act
of interference with a chattel inconsistent with the right of another, whereby
that other is deprived of the use and possession of it. Confidential
information is not of a nature such that it can be converted because if one
appropriates confidential information without taking a physical object, for
example by memorizing or copying the information or by intercepting a private
conversation, the alleged owner is not deprived of the use or possession
thereof. Since there is no deprivation, there can be no conversion. The only
thing that the victim would be deprived of is the confidentiality of the
information. In my opinion, confidentiality cannot be the subject of theft
because it does not fall within the meaning of ""anything"" as defined
above.

 

36.                     It
is no doubt possible to imagine far‑fetched situations where the victim
would actually be deprived of confidential information. For instance, to give
but one example, if an outsider elicits from an employee of the company, who is
the only employee to hold a secret formula, not only that confidential
information but also the undertaking to keep it secret from his employer. In
these circumstances, assuming that confidential information is property, the
element of deprivation would be met. However we must recognize that these
factual situations are somewhat fanciful and will seldom occur. It would be odd
indeed that these rare situations be covered by the law of theft, while the
vast majority of cases concerning the appropriation of confidential information
would remain beyond the reach of our theft section. I am thus of the view that
as a matter of policy, it is best to exclude altogether confidential
information from the realm of theft.

 

37.                     In
the case at bar, the majority of the Court of Appeal held that if Hart had
taken the information requested, the hotel would not have been deprived of the
information, but of its character of confidentiality. As a result, the Court
was of the opinion that Hart would have had the intent set out in s. 283(1) (d),
that is, dealing with the information in such a manner that it could not be
restored in its original confidential condition. With respect, the Court of
Appeal did not properly consider the actus reus required for committing
the offence, that is a taking or a conversion. As I said one cannot be deprived
of confidentiality, because one cannot own confidentiality. One enjoys it.
Therefore, appellant should not have been convicted on the sole basis that he
might have had the intent set out in s. 283(1) (d) since the commission
of the actus reus was not and could not be established.

 

38.                     Before
this Court, respondent also argued that appellant intended to deprive the hotel
of the special property or interest which it had in the list, contrary to s.
283(1) (a). Respondent contended that this special property or interest
is what gave the list its value, namely its confidentiality, and thus that the
absence of intent to deprive of the use of the information is irrelevant. I
cannot agree with this suggestion. The ""special property or interest""
in s. 283(1) (a) refers to a proprietary possessory right in the thing
stolen. This section contemplates for example the case of the owner of an
object who, having pawned it, steals it back from the pawnbroker. Theft would
then be committed because the pawnbroker has a special property or interest in
the object, even against the owner. Although confidentiality might give some
value to the information, it does not confer a special property or interest in
it to anyone. Since confidential information is not property, it follows that
one cannot have a proprietary possessory right in something that is not
property. Furthermore, as I have said above, establishing that an offender has
the intent required is not sufficient proof of guilt if the actus reus
has not been committed.

 

39.                     As
an additional ground for finding guilt, Cory J.A. held that even if information
per se is not property, there still remains a right of property in
confidential information which is now protected by the provisions of the Copyright
Act . As copyright is, in his view, property, it falls within the scope of
s. 283(1)  and can therefore be the object of theft. The employer's list in the
case at bar is indeed a ""literary work"" as defined in s. 2 of the
Act, and thus the subject of copyright under s. 3  thereof. Does that mean
however that the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted information amounts
to theft?

 

40.                     Copyright
is defined as the exclusive right to produce or reproduce a work in its material
form (s. 3). A mere copier of documents, be they confidential or not, does not
acquire the copyright nor deprive its owner of any part thereof. No matter how
many copies are made of a work, the copyright owner still possesses the sole
right to reproduce or authorize the reproduction of his work. Such copying
constitutes an infringement of the copyright under s. 17 of the Act, but it
cannot in any way be theft under the criminal law. While one can, in certain
circumstances, steal a chose in action, the rights provided in the Copyright
Act  cannot be taken or converted as their owner would never suffer
deprivation. Therefore, whether or not copyright is property, it cannot, in my
opinion, be the object of theft under s. 283(1) of the Code.

 

41.                     To
summarize in a schematic way: ""anything"" is not restricted to
tangibles, but includes intangibles. To be the subject of theft it must,
however:

 

1.                be
property of some sort;

 

2.                be
property capable of being

 

(a)               taken‑‑therefore intangibles are
excluded; or

 

(b)               converted‑‑and may be an intangible;

 

(c)               taken or converted in a way that deprives the
owner of his proprietary interest in some way.

 

Confidential
information should not be, for policy reasons, considered as property by the
courts for the purposes of the law of theft. In any event, were it considered
such, it is not capable of being taken as only tangibles can be taken. It
cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save very
exceptional far‑fetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived
of it.

 

42.                     For
all these reasons, I am of the opinion that confidential information does not
come within the meaning of the word ""anything"" of s. 283(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

                                                                    II

Fraud

 

43.                     Appellant
has also been charged with counselling the commission of fraud contrary to s.
338(1)  of the Criminal Code :

 

                   338. (1) Every
one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a
false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any
person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable
security,

 

(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years, where the subject‑matter of the fraud is a
testamentary instrument or where the value thereof exceeds two hundred dollars;

 

44.                     Very
little was argued in this Court in relation to the fraud charge. Be that as it
may, it must be addressed given my conclusion as regards the theft charge.

 

45.                     In
R. v. Olan, supra, this Court held that the element of
""defraud"" in s. 338(1)  is established by proving a dishonest
deprivation. The proof of a risk of prejudice to the economic interests of the
victim is sufficient evidence of the deprivation; actual economic loss is not
essential.

 

46.                     On
the basis of this decision, the majority of the Court of Appeal was of the
opinion that, since promotional groups had previously offered money to the
hotel to obtain the list of its employees, Hart's appropriation of that
information would have caused a risk of prejudice to the hotel's economic
interests. The Court therefore found appellant guilty of counselling the
commission of fraud.

 

47.                     In
his dissent Lacourcière J.A. was of the view that appellant was not guilty
under that count. He held that the hotel was not defrauded of confidential
information since he found that such information was neither ""property,
money [n]or valuable security"". The only question remaining was whether
the appropriation of the information would have resulted in a risk of economic
loss amounting to deprivation. In this regard, Lacourcière J.A. stated (at p.
236):

 

                   It is conceded that there was no intention on the
part of the hotel to deal in a commercial way with the confidential
information. The hotel would not have been defrauded of money or of any
economic advantage; all that the hotel stood to lose was the confidentiality of
the information. Although the respondent would have received some money for the
information I find it difficult to see how the hotel suffered the requisite
deprivation or detriment within the meaning of R. v. Olan, supra.
The deprivation would be clear if the confidential information had been in the
nature of a trade secret or copyrighted material having a commercial value
intended to be exploited by the victim.

 

48.                     In
this I agree with Lacourcière J.A. for the reasons quoted above.

 

49.                     I
would therefore allow the appeal and restore the acquittals entered by the
trial judge.

 

                          Appeal
allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Extradition — International
law — Rule of Specialty — Extradition arrangement with a foreign state —
Prosecution for crimes listed in extradition request — Immunity for crimes
committed before surrender — Reasonable opportunity to return to the requested
state — Whether immunity from prosecution perpetual — Extradition Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. E-21, s. 33.

Appellant, a Canadian citizen, was arrested in Brazil after a
warrant for arrest on a charge of fraud had been laid against him in Canada.
There was no extradition treaty between Canada and Brazil, but an arrangement
was entered into by the two countries which provided in particular that no
surrender should take place unless the requesting state agreed that the person
surrendered would not be imprisoned nor tried for other acts which occurred
before the extradition request.

Appellant was surrendered to Canada in respect of five counts
of fraud and was tried and sentenced. At the expiry of the sentence, Crown
counsel notified appellant that further charges for offences committed prior to
his extradition would be proceeded with. On appellant's return to Canada from a
visit to Portugal, a new information was sworn charging him with thirty-nine
offences.

At the preliminary hearing, the Provincial Court Judge
dismissed a motion for a stay of proceedings holding that the prosecution was
not contrary to Canada's undertaking to Brazil. An application for prohibition
and an order to quash the proceedings were dismissed by the Supreme Court of
Ontario. Appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed and leave to
appeal to this Court was granted.

[Page 951]

At issue is whether a clause in an extradition arrangement
with a foreign state, which prohibits Canada, without qualification, from
prosecuting a person surrendered to it pursuant to that arrangement for crimes,
other than the crimes for which he was surrendered, committed before such
surrender forever bars this country from initiating such a prosecution.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Canada's undertaking does not give appellant immunity after he
has had a reasonable opportunity to return to Brazil. The arrangement between Canada
and Brazil must be read in context and in light of its object and purpose and
in light of the general principles of international law. This undertaking was
related to the surrender. Brazil had an interest in protecting appellant
against the surrender being used for a purpose other than that for which it was
made. The undertaking was not breached in this case. Rather appellant chose to
remain in Canada following the initial prosecution. To accord him the perpetual
immunity he seeks would constitute a significant derogation from Canada's
freedom and independence in dealing with its own citizens within its territory,
a principle central to the international legal order. The undertaking made to Brazil
is related to prosecutions that take place by reason of the surrender of a
fugitive to the requesting state, not cases where prosecution becomes possible
because the accused decided to stay in the requesting state following such
prosecution. Once the accused is no longer here because of the surrender, but
rather because he seeks of his own accord to live in Canada and to enjoy the
protection of its laws, he owes a duty of allegiance to Canada and is subject
to these laws.

APPEAL from a judgment of the

dismissing appellant's application for a writ of prohibition and a certiorari
to quash proceedings. Appeal dismissed.

respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LA FOREST J.—At issue in this
case is the effect of a clause in an extradition arrangement with a foreign
state, which prohibits Canada, without qualification, from prosecuting a person
surrendered to it pursuant to that arrangement for crimes, other than those for
which he was surrendered, committed before such surrender. Specifically, does
such a clause forever bar this country from initiating such a prosecution?

Facts

The appellant, a Canadian
citizen, was arrested in Brazil on August 18, 1978
at the request of the Canadian government after a warrant for arrest on a
charge of fraud had been laid against him in Canada. This was only one of
many complaints about his alleged fraudulent activities. On August 29, 1978,
four other charges of fraud were laid.

[Page 953]

There was no extradition treaty
between Canada and Brazil but Brazilian law permits extradition in
the absence of treaty where the requesting state offers to reciprocate in
respect of fugitives from Brazil. Canada agreed to reciprocate and for that purpose
proclaimed Part II of the Canadian Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21,
to be in effect with respect to Brazil.

The Brazilian law also provides
that no surrender shall take place unless the requesting state agrees that the
person surrendered will not be imprisoned nor tried for other acts which occurred
before the extradition request. By diplomatic note dated January 15, 1980, Canada agreed
to this and a number of other conditions. As a result, the appellant was
surrendered to Canada on January 25 of that year pursuant to the
arrangement to face prosecution on the five counts of fraud. The conditions
agreed to, of which only the first and fourth are relevant, are as follows:

The extraditee shall not be
handed over unless the State undertakes the following:

I—that the extraditee
will not be arrested or tried for other offenses prior to the request for
extradition;

II—to calculate the time
spent in prison in Brazil as detention awaiting trial, when this time is
normally counted for purposes of sentencing;

III—to commute corporal
punishment or the death penalty to a penalty of imprisonment, barring, in the
case of the death penalty, those instances where Brazilian law permits its
application;

IV—that the extraditee
will not be handed over to any other State requesting him without the consent
of Brazil;

V—that political reasons or
motives will not be used to increase the sentence. [Emphasis added.]

Immediately upon the appellant's
return to Canada, he was charged with an additional forty-four
offences, based on acts committed prior to his extradition. At a preliminary
hearing in May, 1980, however, the Crown withdrew the additional charges. The
appellant then pleaded guilty to the original five counts and was sentenced to
eighteen 

[Page 954]

months imprisonment. He was
released on parole on January 26, 1981, and his sentence expired December 29, 1981.

At the preliminary hearing, Crown
counsel notified the appellant that with Brazil's consent before the expiration of his sentence, or
without Brazil's consent afterwards, the Crown would proceed with
the further charges. Canada negotiated with Brazil to obtain its consent,
but Brazil refused unless the appellant consented as well. As could be expected,
the appellant's consent was not forthcoming.

On April 14, 1982, the appellant
left Canada to visit Portugal and returned of his own free will within a month. On
May 26, 1982, a new information was sworn charging him with thirty-nine
offences, all of which were included in the forty-four charges laid upon the
appellant's return to Canada from Brazil. These thirty-nine charges are the basis of these
proceedings. On October 19, 1982, two other charges were laid which are not
part of these proceedings but will likely be affected by the outcome.

The Courts Below

On February 8, 1983, a
preliminary hearing into the thirty-nine charges commenced before Judge S.
Harris of the Provincial Court (Criminal Division) for the Judicial District of
Ottawa-Carleton, at which time counsel for the appellant moved for a stay of
proceedings upon all of the charges. Proceedings in violation of Canada's
undertaking would, it was argued, bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The motion was dismissed on May 5, 1983.
While Harris Prov. Ct. J. believed he had the power to order a stay and that a
stay should issue if the prosecution was contrary to Canada's undertaking to Brazil, he
concluded that the prosecution did not breach the undertaking. He examined the
Rule of Specialty, an alleged principle of international law relating to
extradition, under which a fugitive may only be prosecuted for the offences for
which extradition was 

[Page 955]

granted unless the states
concerned have a special agreement to the contrary or the fugitive consents to
prosecution. Harris Prov. Ct. J. was of the view that there was such a
principle but that it was qualified in that it only applied until the fugitive
had been given a reasonable opportunity to return to the country that
surrendered him. In his view, s. 33  of the Extradition Act  incorporated
both the principle and the qualification. He further held that the appellant
had been given a reasonable opportunity to return to Brazil. In
his view, s. 33  applies to any extradition. The qualification of a reasonable
time limit in that provision applies to all extraditions unless an agreement
specifically provides otherwise. Since the agreement with Brazil was
silent on the point, s. 33  permits the prosecution to take place. To hold
otherwise, he stated, would be to give the appellant a perpetual blanket
immunity from prosecution which would itself bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.

An application for prohibition
and an order to quash the proceedings was then made before Southey J. of the
Supreme Court of Ontario — Ottawa Motions Court. This application was dismissed: [1983] Ont. D.
Crim. Conv. 5475-09 Southey J. noted that the Crown did not dispute that the
prosecution should not be permitted if it constituted a breach of Canada's
undertaking. However, he did not think the prosecution constituted such a
breach. In his view, the undertaking did not provide the appellant with a
perpetual immunity. Since the appellant had been given a reasonable opportunity
to return to the country from which he was extradited, the undertaking was no
longer in effect and the immunity conferred by it had ceased to exist. The
undertaking was silent as to duration. It should be construed as an immunity
from prosecution that lasted only while the appellant was in Canada
pursuant to the extradition and that immunity expired once the appellant was
given an opportunity to leave. That interpretation, he added, was consistent
with the Rule of Specialty as adopted in s. 33  of the Extradition Act 
and the weight of the authorities on international law. Since the appellant had
had a 

[Page 956]

reasonable time and opportunity
to leave Canada, the undertaking with Brazil had expired and the
prosecution would not constitute a breach of the undertaking.

An appeal to the Court of Appeal
of Ontario was dismissed. The Court agreed with the reasons and conclusions of
Southey J.

Leave to appeal to this Court was
then sought and granted: [1985] 1 S.C.R. xi. The issue raised by the appellant
is whether the courts below erred in law ""in their appreciation of the
Rule of Specialty, its application in Canadian Law and in their interpretation
of section 33  of the Extradition Act  and in the effect to be given to
Canada's undertaking to Brazil in this matter"".

Analysis

There is no rule of international
law that requires states to surrender fugitives from justice within their
jurisdiction to countries where they have been accused or convicted of a crime.
But the reciprocal advantage of extradition in promoting law enforcement has
led states to create a global network of extradition treaties. A number of
states have also enacted provisions for the surrender of fugitives even in the
absence of a pre-existing treaty. Such, for example, is Part II of the Canadian
Extradition Act. It was by virtue of this type of legislation that the
appellant was surrendered to Canada.

Most treaties are limited to
crimes therein listed. This ensures that a state to which a request to
surrender a person is made is not obliged to surrender its citizens and other
persons within its allegiance and protection for prosecution in the requesting
state for behaviour not considered criminal in the requested state. As an
adjunct to the practice of restricting extradition to listed crimes, most
treaties also provide that the requesting state shall not try or punish the
fugitive for any crime committed before the extradition other than that for
which the surrender took place. This, I suggest, would be the result in any
event. When a 

[Page 957]

state surrenders a fugitive in
respect of a particular crime, that surrender must necessarily be subject to an
implied condition that the requesting state will not try the fugitive for any
other crime previously committed without the permission of the surrendering
state; see United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407 (1886), at pp. 418,
419-22; In re Dilasser (1952), 19 Int. Law Rep. 377 (Venezuela). This
is seen by some as a customary rule of international law, but it seems to me to
arise out of a proper construction of the treaty; see United States v.
Rauscher, supra; see also S. Z. Feller, ""Reflections on the Nature of
the Speciality Principle in Extradition Relations"" (1977), 12 Israel
Law Rev. 466, at p. 487.

Canada expressly provides that a fugitive shall not be
tried or punished for a crime committed before his surrender unless he has been
restored or given an opportunity to return to the state that surrendered him.
Section 33  of the Extradition Act  reads as follows:

33. Where any person accused
or convicted of an extradition crime is surrendered by a foreign state, in
pursuance of any extradition arrangement, he is not, until after he has been restored
or has had an opportunity of returning to the foreign state within the meaning
of the arrangement, subject, in contravention of any of the terms of the
arrangement, to a prosecution or punishment in Canada for any other offence
committed prior to his surrender, for which he should not, under the
arrangement, be prosecuted.

Section 33  applies not only to
surrenders made under formal general treaties, but to those made under informal
arrangements as well. Section 2  of the Extradition Act  broadly defines
an ""extradition arrangement"" as including any arrangement for the
surrender of fugitive criminals that applies between Canada and a foreign
state, including the kind of ad hoc arrangement involved in this case;
see R. v. Crux and Polvliet (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 427 (B.C.C.A.), leave
to appeal to this Court refused, [1971] S.C.R. viii.

[Page 958]

The appellant maintains, however,
that he is immune from prosecution for crimes committed before his extradition
even though he has had an opportunity to return to Brazil. Where
there is a conflict between the extradition arrangement and s. 33 of the Act,
he argues, the arrangement must prevail, and here he says the undertaking in
the arrangement not to try or prosecute the appellant says nothing about its
termination when the fugitive has had an opportunity to return to the requested
state. He draws support for the first part of this proposition from the
expression ""within the meaning of the arrangement"" in s. 33  and from
s. 3 of the Act. I am prepared to agree with him that if there is a difference
between s. 33  and the undertaking in the arrangement, the arrangement must
govern. Section 3 of the Act makes it clear that no provision of Part I of the
Act, where s. 33  is found, that is inconsistent with the arrangement has the
effect of contravening the arrangement, and that that Part is to be so read and
construed as to provide for the execution of the agreement.

Does Canada's
undertaking, then, give the appellant immunity even after he has had a
reasonable opportunity to return to Brazil? In interpreting this undertaking, it must, as in
the case of other terms in international agreements, be read in context and in
light of its object and purpose as well as in light of the general principles
of international law; see Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, U.N.
Doc. A/Conf. 39/27; (1969), 63 A.J.I.L. 875. When the arrangement was entered
into, the appellant was in Brazil to which he owed local allegiance, and Brazil in
turn owed him the correlative duty of protection. In surrendering a person
under its protection, Brazil would have an interest in seeing that the surrender
was not used for a purpose other than that for which it was made. In short, the
undertaking was related to the surrender. The appellant, however, remains in
this country no longer as a result of the surrender, but because he chooses to
live here. This is not surprising; he is a Canadian citizen. As such, he is
entitled to the protection of our laws, but both as a citizen and a resident,
he owes allegiance to Canada and is subject to its laws. Brazil
exercised its duty of protection by securing the appellant 

[Page 959]

against prosecutions for crimes
other than those for which he was surrendered. But once the appellant is no longer
here because of the surrender but rather because he seeks of his own accord to
live in Canada and to enjoy the protection of our laws, he owes a duty of
allegiance to Canada and is subject to those laws. There can be no doubt,
of course, that the appellant in this case chose to stay in Canada. He
was actually out of the country for a time and returned here despite the
earlier warning that he would be prosecuted for the offences for which he is
now charged.

To accord the appellant the
perpetual immunity he seeks would constitute a significant derogation from Canada's
freedom and independence in dealing with its own citizens within its territory.
The freedom and independence of states is central to the international legal
order and such restrictions are not to be presumed; see The case of the S.S.
""Lotus"" (1927), P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 10. In particular, absent
clear intentions, it is generally agreed that in construing treaties and
international agreements, ""that interpretation should be adopted which involves
the minimum obligation for the parties and which is most favourable to the
freedom and independence of States""; see Harvard Research, Draft
Convention on the Law of Treaties (1935, James W. Garner Reporter), p. 940;
see also Herbert W. Briggs, The Law of Nations (2nd ed.), p. 898.
Consistently with this, Judge Hodgins in Dunbar and Sullivan Dredging Co. v.
The Ship ""Milwaukee""
(1907), 11 Ex. C.R. 179 at p. 188, expressed the following proposition as a
long established rule of international law: ""That no independent
sovereignty is to be construed to contract itself, by implication, out of its
fundamental sovereign rights . … . ""

In the light of the foregoing, I
have no difficulty in concluding that the undertaking made to Brazil is
related to prosecutions which can take place by 

[Page 960]

reason of the surrender of a
fugitive to the requesting state, not to cases where prosecution becomes
possible because the accused decides to stay in the requesting state following
such prosecution. It would require clear terms to persuade me otherwise, for
the view proposed by the appellant would lead to absurd results. The approach I
am taking, I might add, is consistent with all the cases from different nations
that have been brought to our attention; see United States v. Rauscher,
supra, (United States); In re Dilasser, supra, (Venezuela); Novic
v. Public Prosecutor of the Canton of Basel-Stadt (1955), 22 Int. Law
Rep. 515 (Switzerland); Hungary and Austria (Extradition) Case
(1929), 5 Ann. Dig. Pub. Int. Law. 275 (Hungary); see also Hackworth Green H., Digest
of International Law, vol. IV, pp. 232 et seq., esp. at pp. 235-36
(Germany).

The position in the present case
is further strengthened by the fact that Canada also undertook not to surrender
the appellant to any other state without the consent of Brazil. This
condition is not limited to crimes committed before the extradition. Why would
one think Brazil would wish to impose such an obligation on Canada in
perpetuity? That condition bespeaks instead the idea that Canada's
undertakings are to be limited to the period attributable to the surrender.

I do not attach any importance to
the fact that many extradition treaties, including a majority of those
applicable to Canada, expressly add a limitation to the specialty clause
to the effect that the fugitive must be given an opportunity to return. In view
of the principles above enunciated, I look at these additional words as having
been added for clarification or out of an abundance of caution. Some of the
treaties, in fact, set forth specific periods for return. Apart from such
specificity, it should be remembered, a specialty clause would in strictness
seem unnecessary except to give directions to law enforcement and other
officials.

The appellant suggested that in some
countries an extraditee may appear to have been given an opportunity to leave
the country when in fact covert coercion may have been used to deny such 

[Page 961]

an opportunity, and that
specialty clauses containing no limitation may be aimed at preventing such
abuses. I doubt if this argument can be given any weight. Extradition treaties
are based on mutual trust between sovereign powers. What is more, it is
difficult to understand why states chose one form of specialty clause rather
than another. It may be owing to the vagaries of negotiation, and because a
particular type of clause is traditionally used by particular countries. Among
the countries with which Canada has treaties with specialty clauses containing
no reasonable or specific time limits are France and Switzerland. Why we should wish to have stricter safeguards in
our dealings with these friendly nations than with other countries is difficult
to imagine. In this context, it is interesting that in Novic, supra, the
Supreme Court of Switzerland ordered the extradition of a fugitive to France
despite the unqualified character of the specialty clause in question in that
case. The court there relied on the fact that the law in each country provided
a period of protection to a fugitive of only one month, but I would tend to
view this as a recognition by those states that immunity from prosecution
following extradition is related to the surrender and is not intended to last
forever.

The appellant also drew attention
to the fact that, whereas s. 33  of the Extradition Act  contemplates
return within a reasonable time, s. 40 , in Part II of the Act, makes no
reference to the fact that this assurance terminates when the accused has had a
reasonable opportunity to return. The latter section simply provides that no
surrender from Canada shall take place in the absence of a treaty unless
the foreign state gives an assurance that the person surrendered shall not be
tried for any offence other than the one for which he is surrendered. As I see
it, however, the reason for this distinction is as follows. Section 33  is
intended to instruct and direct prosecutors and courts in Canada to ensure that
Canada complies with its ordinary international obligations. Section 40 , on
the other hand, is there to ensure that a surrender 

[Page 962]

made by Canada in the
absence of a treaty is not used as a means to prosecute a person within its
protection for crimes other than those for which that person is surrendered.
But if a fugitive decides to stay in the foreign country of his own volition
following prosecution for the crime for which he was surrendered by Canada, then
he must take the law of the foreign country as he finds it. In the absence of
clear words, the assurance must be looked upon as being related to the
surrender.

Disposition

For these reasons, I would
dismiss the appeal.

          Appellant
was charged with unlawful possession of house‑breaking instruments
contrary to s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code . This section provides that
""Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him,
has in his possession any instrument suitable for house‑breaking . . .
under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument
has been used or is or was intended to be used for house‑breaking . . .
is guilty of an indictable offence . . . ."" Prior to entering a plea,
appellant moved to quash the indictment. The judge granted the motion on the
ground that s. 309(1)  was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence in s.
11 (d) of the Charter . On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside
the order quashing the indictment and directed that the indictment be
prosecuted in the ordinary way. The Court held that s. 309(1)  did not constitute
a ""reverse onus"" clause and thus was not inconsistent with s. 11 (d)
of the Charter . This appeal is to determine whether s. 309(1) of the Code
violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter  and, if so, whether such
violation is justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

 

          Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

          Per McIntyre and Le
Dain JJ.: Section 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  is not inconsistent with
s. 11 (d) of the Charter  which guarantees the right to be presumed
innocent unless proven guilty according to the law. The burden of proof under
s. 309(1)  must be discharged without the benefit of any presumption

against the
accused.

 

          The words
""reasonable inference"" (of guilt) in s. 309(1)  do not enable a
finding of guilt on something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. These
words employed in a criminal enactment can mean only an inference which on the
basis of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt would warrant
a conclusion of guilt in the absence of any answer or explanation. An inference
of guilt is not reasonable in the criminal context unless it overrides a
reasonable doubt.

 

          The
phrase ""without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him"" in
the context of s. 309(1)  does not amount to a reverse onus clause which imposed
a burden on the accused to prove his innocence. These words were included in
the section in order to make available the defence of innocent purpose, which
would not have been open to an accused without this phrase because, in the
words of the section prior to 1972, the offence was complete without
consideration of purpose. When the section was amended in 1972 to make the
intention to use the instrument for house‑breaking an essential element
of the offence, the phrase was rendered superfluous. The purpose for which the
accused intended to use the tools was effectively converted from a defence
which the accused had to prove to show his innocence, to an essential element
of the offence which the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to prove
his guilt. As a result, the phrase was denuded of its original content and was
probably retained in the section out of an abundance of caution.

 

          The
general common law excuses, such as duress or authorization by law, are not
encompassed within the phrase ""without lawful excuse"" and need not be
proved on a balance of probabilities. These words do not encompass excuses or
justifications that would exist if the words were omitted from the Code.
In any event, even if s. 309(1)  would require the accused to establish such
defences on a balance of probabilities, this requirement would not offend s.
11 (d) of the Charter . Defences or excuses of this nature can only
be raised where the offence has been proved. Where, as in this case, proof of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is required without the benefit of any
presumption before any need for defence arises, s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
is not offended.

 

          Per La Forest J.: I am
in agreement with the interpretation given s. 309(1) of the Code by
McIntyre J. So interpreted, the section does not conflict with s. 11 (d)
of the Charter .

 

          Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer J.: The intention to use the instruments for house‑breaking
purposes is an essential component of the offence under s. 309(1) of the Code.
The Crown must prove not only possession of the instruments specified in the
indictment and that they were suitable for house‑breaking purposes beyond
a reasonable doubt, but also ""circumstances that give rise to a reasonable
inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for
house‑breaking"". Such an inference, in the context of a criminal
charge, can only be reasonable where the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused actually intended to or did use the instruments for the
purpose of house‑breaking. The section therefore does not place a
persuasive burden on the accused to establish a lack of intention to use the
instruments for house‑breaking purposes. Any burden on the accused with
respect to such a defence is purely an evidential one. But the opening words of
s. 309(1)  ‑‑ namely, ""without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him"" ‑‑ place a persuasive burden on the
accused to establish on a balance of probabilities an excuse in circumstances
where he admits an intention to use the instruments for house‑breaking
purposes but claims a justification for his actions, such as duress or
authorization by law.

 

          Section
309(1) of the Code violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
Although, strictly speaking, s. 309(1)  is not a ""reverse onus""
provision, in that it does not presume an essential element of the offence, the
provision, by requiring proof by the accused of certain defences on a balance
of probabilities, makes it possible for a conviction to occur despite the
existence of a reasonable doubt. Any burden on an accused which has the effect
of dictating a conviction despite the presence of a reasonable doubt
contravenes s. 11 (d).

 

          Section
309(1) of the Code is not justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .
The section does not meet the proportionality test enunciated in Oakes.
First, section 309(1) does not impair ""as little as possible"" the
right or freedom guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . Given the
circumstances surrounding this kind of offence and the objective of curbing
property‑related crimes, Parliament could have imposed simply an
evidential burden on the accused to introduce some evidence raising a
reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Second, the effects which result from
imposing a persuasive burden on the accused in connection with a criminal offence
making unlawful the possession of even the most innocuous of tools are too
deleterious. Section 309(1)  leaves open the possibility that innocent persons
will be jailed.

 

          Finally,
the fact that s. 309(1) of the Code is not justifiable under s. 1  of the
Charter  does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the whole of s.
309(1)  is void. The excision of the words ""the proof of which lies upon
him"" from the provision would eliminate the possibility of the conviction
of an accused who had a lawful excuse for his actions but could not prove that
excuse on a balance of probabilities.

          The
reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. were delivered by

 

          The Chief Justice ‑‑ The appellant, Murray Ross Holmes, was charged
with unlawful possession of house‑breaking instruments. Section 309(1)  of
the Criminal Code  provides that a person who, without lawful excuse, is
found in possession of an instrument suitable for house‑breaking, in
circumstances which give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument has
been used or is or was intended to be used for house‑breaking, is guilty
of an indictable offence. This appeal concerns the constitutionality of s.
309(1) . The appellant Mr. Holmes argues that s. 309(1)  violates the presumption
of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms . The Crown submits that s. 309(1)  at no time requires an
accused to disprove guilt in a manner which violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

Statutory and
Constitutional Provisions

 

          Before
reviewing the factual and procedural history of this appeal, I will set out the
relevant statutory and constitutional provisions.

 

          Criminal
Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34 (as amended by S.C. 1972, c. 13, s. 25):

 

          309.(1) Every one who,
without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession
any instrument suitable for house‑breaking, vault‑breaking or safe‑breaking,
under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument
has been used or is or was intended to be used for house‑breaking, vault‑breaking
or safe‑breaking, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for fourteen years.

 

          Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms :

 

          1. The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out
in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

          11. Any person charged
with an offence has the right

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

          (d)
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and
public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

                                                                    II

 

Facts

 

          As
stated, Murray Ross Holmes was charged that he unlawfully had in his possession
instruments suitable for house‑breaking to wit: a pair of vice grips and
a pair of pliers under circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable inference
that the said instruments were intended to be used for house‑breaking,
contrary to s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code . Prior to entering a plea,
counsel for Holmes moved to quash the indictment. Clements Co. Ct. J. granted
the motion: (1982), 38 O.R. (2d) 290.

 

          On
appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal set aside the order of Clements Co. Ct. J.,
and directed that the indictment be prosecuted in the ordinary way: (1983), 41
O.R. (2d) 250.

 

                                                                   III

Judgments

 

          Clements
Co. Ct. J. quashed the indictment on the ground thats. 309(1) of the Code
was inconsistent with the presumption of innocence and s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
In his view, because it requires the Crown only to prove circumstances which
give rise to ""a"" reasonable inference of guilty intent, s. 309(1) of
the Code places an onus on the accused to adduce evidence of an
alternative, and equally compelling, reasonable inference of innocent intent;
that runs counter to the presumption of innocence entrenched in s. 11 (d)
of the Charter .

 

          In a
unanimous judgment, Lacourcière J.A. (Weatherston and Cory JJ.A. concurring),
of the Ontario Court of Appeal held that s. 309(1)  does not constitute a
""reverse onus"" clause and thus is not inconsistent with s. 11 (d)
of the Charter . In interpreting s. 309(1) , he relied on the following
statement by Martin J.A. in R. v. Kozak and Moore (1975), 20 C.C.C. (2d)
175 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 179‑80:

 

As will be gathered
from what I have already said, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove: (a)
possession by the accused of the instruments specified in the indictment; (b)
that they were suitable for the purpose of housebreaking, safe‑breaking
or vault‑breaking; (c) that such instruments were found under
circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instruments
were intended to be used for housebreaking, safe‑breaking or vault‑breaking.
It was only after those elements were proved that the accused were required to
discharge the burden of proving a lawful excuse for the possession of such
instruments on a balance of probabilities: see Tupper v. The Queen,
[1967] 1 C.C.C. 253, 63 D.L.R. (2d) 289, [1967] S.C.R. 589.

 

As for the
reference in s. 309(1)  to ""without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies
upon him"", Lacourcière J.A. stated the following (at p. 258):

 

The burden of
adducing evidence of lawful excuse is not meant to apply to any of the inside
requirements if I may extend the expression of Chief Justice Laskin [in Taraschuk
v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 385, at p. 388], i.e., the three
essential ingredients previously mentioned, but only to an extraneous excuse
such as ""I was insane"", ""I was under compulsion by threats"",
""I was drunk"", ""I was under automatism"", etc. These are
clearly extraneous excuses. On the other hand, if the explanation is ""I am
a plumber"" or a tradesman who uses tools suitable for house‑breaking,
the excuse may not have the same extraneous quality. It is nevertheless an
excuse within the meaning of the section which requires proof by a
preponderance of evidence. The reason for this is that it is based on the
admission that although circumstances existed that, even if objectively viewed,
gave rise to the requisite reasonable inference, such inference ought not in
fact to be drawn in the circumstances because of the explanation.

 

Lacourcière J.A.
concluded by stating (at p. 256):

 

Section 309(1)  does
not raise any presumption or create any reverse onus in the true sense. The
Crown must establish the three mentioned essential ingredients by proof beyond
a reasonable doubt. Only then can the evidentiary onus be shifted to the
accused to provide, on a balance of probabilities, a lawful excuse. The section
does not require that the Crown prove an intent to use the instruments for
house‑breaking. If, however, the third requirement of circumstances,
etc., is said to create a presumption of house‑breaking intent, I would
be prepared to say that such intent is rationally connected to the facts
required to be proved and meets the test enunciated in R. v. Oakes
[(1983), 145 D.L.R. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.)].

 

Seeing the quashing
of the indictment as tantamount to an acquittal based on an error of law,
Lacourcière J.A. allowed the appeal, set aside the order of Clements Co. Ct. J.
and directed that the prosecution of the indictment continue.

 

                                                                   IV

The Issues

 

          The
constitutional questions in this appeal were stated as follows:

 

1.Is section 309(1) of the Criminal Code  of
Canada inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

2.If so, is s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada justified on the basis of s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?

 

          The
Attorneys General of Canada, Quebec and Saskatchewan intervened in the appeal
in support of the Crown respondent.

 

          The above
questions call for three separate lines of inquiry. First, meaning must be
given to s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code . This Court must give precise
content to the provision in light of its legislative and jurisprudential
history. A host of conflicting interpretations has been offered by the parties
and interveners to this appeal. Secondly, the implications of s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  in relation to the provision on its true construction
must be addressed. Thirdly, assuming the answer to the first constitutional
question to be in the affirmative, the effect of s. 1  of the Charter 
must be analyzed.

 

                                                                    V

 

Section 309(1)  of
the Criminal Code 

 

          Counsel
for the appellant submits that s. 309(1)  is a ""reverse onus""
provision and contravenes s. 11 (d) of the Charter . She argues
that s. 309(1)  permits the Crown to rely on evidence equally consistent with a
reasonable and innocent explanation, because the section requires the Crown to
prove only that one inference is that the accused intended to use the
instruments for burglary purposes. This appears to follow Clements Co. Ct. J.'s
line of reasoning and arguably leads to the conclusion that the section has the
effect of lowering the standard of proof required of the Crown below that of a
reasonable doubt, since evidence consistent with both guilty intent and
innocent intent would not constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt. With
respect to the phrase ""without lawful excuse"", counsel for the
appellant submits that it reinforces the conclusion that the accused bears the
burden of proving innocent intent on a balance of probabilities.

 

          The
respondent Crown's primary submission is that s. 309(1)  does not create a
reverse onus at all. In its view, a reverse onus exists when an accused is
required to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of an
essential element of an offence. In its supplementary factum, it submits that
the purpose or intention of the accused in possessing the instruments in
question is not an essential element of the offence. Adopting the submissions
of the Attorney General of Quebec on this point, the Crown argues that s.
309(1)  does not require an accused to disprove any of the three essential
elements of the offence as outlined by Martin J.A. in R. v. Kozak and Moore,
supra, on a balance of probabilities. As such, s. 309(1)  does not
constitute a reverse onus clause. In the alternative, the Crown submits that if
the intention of an accused is an essential element of the offence, any burden
placed on the accused merely is an evidential one. That is, s. 309(1) 's
reference to ""a reasonable inference"" simply describes ""the
general process by which an inference of intent is to be drawn""; the
question is essentially the same as in all criminal offences: did the accused
actually have the intent to use the instruments for house‑breaking? The
burden of proving intent, in this alternative submission, remains on the Crown
throughout the trial. With respect to the phrase ""without lawful
excuse"", the Crown submits that it is an anachronism carried forward to
the present from early English legislation. It submits that the clause may be
superfluous as it creates no defence that is not already available. The
interveners, the Attorney General of Canada, the

Attorney General of
Quebec and the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, make similar submissions.

 

          After
careful consideration, I am of the view that intention is an essential element
of the offence and that the section does not require an accused to disprove
guilty intent on a balance of probabilities. The burden of proving intention to
use the instrument for house‑breaking rests on the Crown. The reference
to ""circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the
instrument . . . was intended to be used for house‑breaking""
permits, but does not require, the jury to draw an inference of guilty intent
from suspicious circumstances. If the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused actually intended to engage in an unlawful act, that
inference ought to be drawn. On the other hand, I am also of the view that the
opening words of s. 309(1) , namely, ""without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him"", place a persuasive burden on the accused to
establish on a balance of probabilities an excuse in circumstances where he or
she seeks to justify his or her actions despite an intention to use an
instrument for house‑breaking purposes. Such would be the case where an
accused seeks an acquittal due to duress or authorization by law. I reach this
conclusion in light of this Court's reasoning in Tupper v. The Queen,
[1967] S.C.R. 589, and s. 309(1) 's legislative history.

 

          In Tupper
v. The Queen, this Court had occasion to address s. 295(1) of the Code,
the predecessor of s. 309(1) . Section 295(1) provided the following:

 

          295.(1) Every one who
without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession
any instrument for house‑breaking, vault‑breaking or safe‑breaking
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen
years.

 

          The facts
in Tupper were that early one morning police stopped a car in which
Tupper was a passenger. Various screwdrivers, a flashlight, a crowbar, two
nylon stockings and numerous items of clothing were found in the vehicle. Upon
appeal to this Court, Tupper submitted that the Crown must prove some event,
overt action or declaration to identify the tools with a specific unlawful
purpose before the onus is cast on the accused to provide an explanation.
Tupper relied on the following line of jurisprudence: R. v. Smith
(1957), 27 C.R. 359 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Haire (1958), 29 C.R. 233 (Alta.
C.A.); and R. v. McRae (1967), 50 C.R. 325 (Sask. C.A.) A conflicting
line of authority was reflected in such cases as R. v. Gilson, [1965] 2
O.R. 505 (C.A.); R. v. Kernychne (Ont. C.A., March 17, 1965,
unreported); R. v. Singleton (1956), 115 C.C.C. 391 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Jones (1960), 128 C.C.C. 230 (B.C.C.A.)

 

          Judson
J., for the majority of the Court in Tupper, dismissed the appellant's
argument and, at p. 593, stated the following:

 

          Once
possession of an instrument capable of being used for housebreaking has been
shown, the burden shifts to the accused to show on a balance of probabilities
that there was lawful excuse for possession of the instrument at the time and
place in question.

 

          Hall J.
wrote a separate judgment concurring in the result, but expressed concern over
the breadth of the prohibition. At page 594, he stated:

 

          Whether
Parliament intended it or not, s. 295(1), as it reads, permits of no other
interpretation. It puts the possessor of many necessary tools of trade,
automobile accessories and tools and hundreds of similar instruments used and
carried daily for routine purposes which might be capable of being used for
house‑breaking in the position that merely from being in possession under
the most innocent circumstances, he can be brought into court and put to the
proof that he has a lawful excuse for having a screwdriver, a flashlight or
some other such household tool or instrument in his car, boat, tool kit or on
his person at any given time or place which includes his home. It can be argued
and readily accepted that this may not happen frequently, but it can and may
happen if Parliament really intended what the section says when, without any
qualification as to time or circumstance, it put the burden of proof on the
person in whose possession any such item may be found.

 

          The
interpretation which the wording of the section compels should, I think, be
drawn to Parliament's attention.

 

          Tupper,
then, stands for the proposition that the provision, as it was then worded, did
not require the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused
actually intended to use the instruments for house‑breaking purposes. All
it needed to show was possession of an instrument capable of being used for
house‑breaking; once that was shown, the onus fell upon the accused to
persuade the jury that he or she had a lawful excuse for possessing the
instrument in question. Tupper has since been affirmed by this Court in R.
v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303, and the same conclusion has been reached
with respect to similar legislation in England. See R. v. Patterson
(1961), 46 Cr. App. R. 106.

 

          It should
be noted that s. 295(1) did not relieve the Crown of its obligation to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the offence as it was then
worded: namely, possession by the accused of the instruments specified in the
indictment, and that those instruments were suitable for the purpose of house‑breaking.
Once these elements were established beyond a reasonable doubt, however, the
accused bore the burden of proving ""lawful excuse"" on a balance of
probabilities. A ""lawful excuse"" thus does not refer to, or tend to
disprove, an element of an offence; rather, it refers to ""matters which
stand outside the requirements which must be met"" (Taraschuk v. The
Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 385, at p. 388). Since an intention to use the
instruments for an unlawful purpose was not an element of the offence as it was
then worded, an accused was required to disprove such an intention on a balance
of probabilities. Section 295(1), however, placed a similar, persuasive burden
on an accused who admitted committing the offence and an intention to
use the instruments for house‑breaking purposes but who sought exculpation,
for example, on grounds of duress or authorization by law. Such defences
equally stood ""outside the requirements which [had to be] met"". As
such, they had to be established on a balance of probabilities.

 

          In 1972,
perhaps in response to Hall J.'s concurring judgment, Parliament amended s. 309
(S.C. 1972, c. 13), which, for ease of reference, I repeat:

 

          309.(1) Every one who,
without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession
any instrument suitable for house‑breaking, vault‑breaking or safe‑breaking,
under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the
instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for house‑breaking,
vault‑breaking or safe‑breaking, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. [Emphasis added.]

 

          The
effect of this amendment was to make an intention to use the instruments an
essential component of the offence. The Crown must prove not only possession of
the instruments specified in the indictment and that they were suitable for
house‑breaking purposes beyond a reasonable doubt, but also
""circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the
instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for house‑breaking"".
The jury must ask itself whether, given the circumstances, it is reasonable to
conclude that the accused intended to, or did, use the instruments for house‑breaking
purposes. Such an inference, in the context of a criminal charge, can only be
reasonable where the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused actually intended to, or did, use the instruments for the purpose of
house‑breaking: R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860.

 

          The 1972
amendment thus had the effect of displacing Tupper to the extent that Tupper
placed a persuasive burden on the accused to establish a lack of intention to
use the instruments for house‑breaking purposes. Any burden on the
accused with respect to such a defence is purely an evidential one: in the
absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Crown's case may be sufficiently
strong to support a finding that the accused possessed the requisite intent
beyond a reasonable doubt. Upon the presentation of such circumstantial
evidence by the Crown, the accused is placed in the position of being well‑advised
to adduce evidence which would have the effect of raising a reasonable doubt
that he or she intended to use the instruments for house‑breaking
purposes. No longer is he or she obliged to persuade the jury of a lack of such
an intention on a balance of probabilities, as was the case prior to 1972. If
the jury entertains a reasonable doubt as to the accused's intention, it should
not draw the inference of guilty intent from the circumstances and should enter
a verdict of not guilty.

 

          But,
while the effect of the amendment was to displace the rule in Tupper
with respect to defences or excuses which have the effect of negating the
inference that the accused intended to use the instruments for house‑breaking
purposes, s. 309(1)  continues to cast a persuasive burden on the accused in
circumstances where he or she admits that intention but claims a justification
for his or her actions, such as duress or authorization by law. In other words,
in circumstances where an accused seeks to raise a defence absolving him or her
of liability despite proof of actus reus and mens rea beyond a
reasonable doubt, s. 309(1) , like its predecessor, still requires the accused
to establish such a defence on a balance of probabilities. In such
circumstances, the persuasive burden on the accused remains.

 

          I have
had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague, McIntyre J. With the
greatest respect, I do not agree with his conclusion that the phrase
""without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him"" is limited
to the lawful excuse of innocent intention. Nor do I agree that the entire
phrase was rendered superfluous by the 1972 amendment to s. 309(1) .

 

          ""Lawful
excuse"" is a very general term. It normally includes all of the defences
which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from
criminal liability. It can also include excuses specific to particular
offences. The word ""excuse"" is used in this broad meaning in s. 7(3) 
of the Criminal Code , which provides that all common law justifications
and excuses continue to be available under the Code. This provision has
been interpreted to mean that the common law defences are not frozen in time.
They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences.

 

          There is
no doubt that Parliament can re‑define the meaning of ""excuse"",
for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a
particular offence, or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses. The
important point is that Parliament should give some indication, express or implied,
that it has changed the meaning of ""excuse"" when it uses it in a
statute. Otherwise, the word will be understood to have the meaning of
""excuse"" under the common law and as used by s. 7(3) , a broad term
that allows for the development of defences in relation to changes in the law
and in the context of particular offences. If Parliament does not give some
indication that it has assigned a particular meaning to ""excuse"", the
word will be taken to have the same meaning as ""excuse"" under the
common law and in s. 7(3) .

 

          With this
in mind, I am unable to agree that the words ""lawful excuse"", which
normally include a range of defences, have by their inclusion in

s. 309(1)  been
limited to one meaning and one meaning alone, namely, a defence of innocent
purpose. There is nothing in the wording of the section to suggest that
Parliament has narrowed the concept, qualified it, or given it a specific
meaning. I conclude that the phrase includes all defences which are commonly
considered to be lawful excuses. It may well be that the common law of excuses
is flexible enough to allow for the development of the specific defence of
innocent purpose in answer to a charge under s. 309(1) , but I do not agree that
the general term can be said to be limited to this defence alone.

 

          A similar
point arose in Brownridge v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 926, which
considered the meaning of a ""reasonable excuse"" for refusing to
supply a breath sample under the impaired driving provisions. Laskin J., as he
then was, writing for himself and Hall J., held that the phrase did not include
defences that would otherwise be available, and concluded that a denial of the
right to counsel under the Canadian Bill of Rights was not a reasonable
excuse for refusing a breath sample. With respect for Laskin J., I prefer the
opinion of Ritchie J., writing for himself, Fauteux C.J. and Martland and
Spence JJ., who held that ""reasonable excuse"" included a denial of
the right to counsel. Ritchie J. seems to have understood the phrase
""reasonable excuse"" to be a general term which could include a
variety of excuses, without distinctions based on whether an excuse had been
generally recognised by the law as an excuse or was specific to the offence in
question. (There was no majority on this point since Ritchie and Laskin JJ.
agreed in the result, while Abbott, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting, would
have held that the accused was not detained and thus had no right to counsel.)

 

          Because I
do not agree that the words ""lawful excuse"" are limited to the
defence of innocent purpose, I cannot agree with McIntyre J.'s conclusion that
the phrase was rendered superfluous by the 1972 amendment. Since the phrase
includes lawful excuses other than that of innocent purpose, it continues to
have a meaning. Nor is it simply surplusage. The phrase ""the proof of
which lies upon him"" means that an accused who wishes to raise a defence
of lawful excuse must prove it on a balance of probabilities, following the
principle set out in Tupper, supra, R. v. Appleby, supra,
and R. v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525.

 

          Section
309(1)  requires the accused to prove a lawful excuse on a balance of
probabilities. The question to be answered, therefore, is whether s. 309(1) 
runs counter to the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty enshrined
in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                                                                   VI

 

The Presumption of
Innocence and Section 11 (d) of the Charter 

 

          The
overarching principle of judicial review under the Charter  is that the
judiciary is entrusted with the duty of ensuring that legislatures do not
infringe unjustifiably upon certain fundamental individual and collective
interests

in the name of the
broader common good. Viewed from one perspective, this profound responsibility
potentially can be seen as challenging the nature of democratic institutions in
Canada, to the extent that those institutions represent the collective voice of
the communities and individuals which comprise Canadian society. Viewed from
another perspective, however, in interpreting and giving meaning to
constitutional guarantees and determining what constitute reasonable limits
under s. 1  of the Charter , the courts are guided by the same principle
under both lines of inquiry: namely, that Canadian society is to be free and
democratic. The infusion of the spirit of individual and collective democratic
aspirations into the process of defining the contours of constitutional
guarantees and determining the reasonableness of state‑imposed
limitations on those guarantees thus ensures that the courts are and will
remain allies of Canadian democracy, strengthening any weaknesses of democracy
by providing a voice and a remedy for those excluded from equal and effective
democratic participation in our society.

 

          The
purposes behind the presumption of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d) of
the Charter , and its relationship to a democratic and free society, have
been addressed in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 119‑20,
as follows:

 

          The
presumption of innocence is a hallowed principle lying at the very heart of
criminal law. Although protected expressly in s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
the presumption of innocence is referable and integral to the general
protection of life, liberty and security of the person contained in s. 7  of the
Charter  (see Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, per
Lamer J.) The presumption of innocence protects the fundamental liberty and
human dignity of any and every person accused by the State of criminal conduct.
An individual

charged with a
criminal offence faces grave social and personal consequences, including
potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to social stigma and ostracism
from the community, as well as other social, psychological and economic harms.
In light of the gravity of these consequences, the presumption of innocence is
crucial. It ensures that until the State proves an accused's guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent. This is essential in a society
committed to fairness and social justice. The presumption of innocence confirms
our faith in humankind; it reflects our belief that individuals are decent and
law‑abiding members of the community until proven otherwise.

 

Thus, the
presumption of innocence is a value deeply embedded in the fabric of Canadian
legal history and a manifestation of a social commitment to justice. The right
to be presumed innocent until proven guilty when charged with a criminal
offence accords the respect and concern due to individuals by virtue of their
fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of the person. As such, it is
simultaneously a legal articulation of the relationship between the individual
and the community and a recognition of the necessity of the rule of law.

 

          Canadian
and international authorities on both the presumption of innocence and its
relationship to a ""reverse onus"" clause were canvassed extensively in
Oakes and it is sufficient to reiterate that, with respect to the
former, the minimum content of the right to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty is threefold. First, an individual must be proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. Secondly, the state bears the burden of proof. Thirdly,
criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with lawful procedures
and fairness (R. v. Oakes, at p. 121). With respect to the relationship
between the presumption of innocence and a ""reverse onus"" clause, it
was stated at pp. 132‑33:

 

          In
general one must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused
to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact,
which is an important element of the offence in question, violates the
presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d). If an accused bears the burden of
disproving on a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it
would be possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a
reasonable doubt. This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence
to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the
jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue.

 

          At the
same time, it ought to be stressed that the presumption of innocence is
violated not only when an accused is required to disprove an essential element
of the offence. The fact that reverse onuses which accomplish this result run
counter to s. 11 (d) was made clear in Oakes. To limit s. 11 (d)
to determinations whether an element is integral or extraneous to an offence,
however, would lose sight of the fact that because of the grave social and
personal consequences engendered by a finding of criminal liability, the law
requires proof thereof beyond a reasonable doubt. Any burden on an accused
which has the effect of dictating a conviction despite the presence of
reasonable doubt, whether that burden relates to proof of an essential element
of the offence or some element extraneous to the offence but nonetheless
essential to verdict, contravenes s. 11 (d) of the Charter . An
accused must not be placed in the position of being required to do more than
raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt, regardless of whether that
doubt arises from uncertainty as to the sufficiency of Crown evidence
supporting the constituent elements of the offence or from uncertainty as to
criminal culpability in general.

 

          Again, I
must respectfully disagree with McIntyre J., who argues that there is no
violation of the presumption of innocence even if the accused is required to
prove a lawful excuse. It is not possible to say that the Crown has proved the
case beyond a reasonable doubt when it has led all its evidence, nor is it
possible to say that the presumption of innocence has been overcome when the
Crown finishes presenting its case. The presumption of innocence cannot be
rebutted part way through the trial. It continues to apply throughout, up to
the final judgment by the trier of fact. The trier of fact can never decide
that guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt until it has heard all the
evidence in the case. Only then, when all the evidence is in, is the trier of
fact permitted to decide whether the presumption of innocence has been overcome
and guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

          The
argument that the Crown can rebut the presumption of innocence simply by
presenting a case has a serious consequence, that the accused could be required
by law to present defence evidence or face conviction. The common law position
has been that the accused is never required to lead evidence. If the Crown
presents a case and the defence presents no evidence, the trier of fact may
convict but is never required to do so. The fact that a case goes to the trier
of fact for consideration does not mean that guilt has been proven; it means
only that the Crown has presented enough evidence to require consideration. An
acquittal is always possible. But that acquittal would not be available to the
accused because the jury would be compelled to convict even though that jury
entertained a reasonable doubt as to the use or intended use of those
instruments by the accused.

 

          The basic
principle of the common law has been that the accused need not prove a defence.
Once an accused raises the possibility that a defence exists, whether by
pointing to some fact in the Crown evidence or by leading defence evidence, the
Crown is required to disprove the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. The common
law has not distinguished in this area between defences that challenge the
existence of a necessary element of the offence and those defences that admit
the mens rea and actus reus but avoid criminal liability because
of circumstances that excuse or justify the conduct. With either type of
defence, all that the accused need do is point to some evidence which supports
the defence. The Crown is then required to disprove the defence beyond a
reasonable doubt. Examples of this principle can be found in Latour v. The
King, [1951] S.C.R. 19, which held that the Crown must disprove provocation
and self‑defence, once those defences are raised by the accused; Linney
v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 646, which repeated that the onus is on the
Crown to disprove provocation; and Perka v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
232, which held that the Crown must disprove the defence of necessity beyond a
reasonable doubt. In light of the common law's approach to the onus of proof in
these defences, I think that a requirement that the accused prove defences that
excuse his or her conduct would violate the presumption of innocence.

 

          Section
309(1) , in my view, runs counter to the presumption of innocence. If an accused
has a lawful excuse, the section, by its very terms, places the onus on the
accused to establish that excuse. Although, strictly speaking, s. 309(1)  is not
a ""reverse onus"" provision, in that it does not presume an essential
element of the offence, the provision, by requiring proof by the accused of
certain defences on a balance of probabilities, makes it ""possible for a
conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt"" (R. v.
Oakes, at p. 132). While s. 11(d) of the Charter  does not
dictate that the Crown prove at the outset the absence of every conceivable
defence, it does require that when the facts introduced by the Crown or the
accused fairly raise the possibility of a successful defence, all that is ever
required of an accused is to raise a reasonable doubt. Section 309(1)  requires
an accused to adduce evidence on a balance of probabilities. It follows that s.
309(1)  constitutes a violation of s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

                                                                  VII

Section 1  of the Charter 

 

          The
respondent Crown, in the alternative, adopts the submissions of the Attorney
General of Canada and the Attorney General of Quebec with respect to s. 1  of
the Charter . The Attorney General of Canada argues that s. 309(1) of the
Code, assuming it infringes s. 11 (d) of the Charter , is
justified under s. 1  as it is designed to meet a valid federal objective,
impairs the right only in so far as is deemed necessary for the protection of
society, and is not arbitrary or unfair in its application. In sum, it submits
that the provision, when viewed in the context of the need for the protection
of society, represents a proportionate response to the incidence of property‑related
offences involving break‑ins. The Attorney General of Quebec and the
Attorney General of Saskatchewan make similar submissions. The appellant takes
issue with these submissions and argues, first, that although the objective of
s. 309(1) , the suppression of house‑breaking and safe‑breaking, is
not a trivial objective, it is not of such grave significance as to justify the
violation of so central a right as the presumption of innocence. Thus, it is
submitted that the social purpose sought to be attained does not justify the
violation of s. 11 (d). Secondly, it is submitted by the appellant that
the imposition of an evidential burden would achieve the same societal goal,
and, concomitantly, avoid the conviction of an accused who raised a doubt as to
his or her guilt but was unable to satisfy a standard of proof on a balance of
probabilities.

 

          In Oakes,
this Court outlined the interpretive principles relevant to the inquiry into
when an infringement of a constitutional right or freedom is justified under s.
1  of the Charter  as a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society (at pp. 138‑39):

 

          To
establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society, two central criteria must be satisfied. First, the
objective, which the measures responsible for a limit on a Charter  right
or freedom are designed to serve, must be ""of sufficient importance to
warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom"": R.
v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352. The standard must be high
in order to ensure that objectives which are trivial or discordant with the
principles integral to a free and democratic society do not gain s. 1 
protection. It is necessary, at a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns
which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society before it
can be characterized as sufficiently important.

 

          Second,
once a sufficiently significant objective is recognized, then the party
invoking s. 1  must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably
justified. This involves ""a form of proportionality test"": R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352. Although the nature of the
proportionality test will vary depending on the circumstances, in each case
courts will be required to balance the interests of society with those of
individuals and groups. There are, in my view, three important components of a
proportionality test. First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to
achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based
on irrational considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected to
the objective. Second, the means, even if rationally connected to the objective
in this first sense, should impair ""as little as possible"" the right
or freedom in question: R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p.
352. Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the
measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter  right or
freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of ""sufficient
importance"".

 

          As noted,
the respondent and interveners all submit that the prevention of house‑breaking
is a sufficiently pressing and substantial objective to warrant the
infringement of the s. 11 (d) right to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty when charged with an offence. Specifically, the Attorney General of Canada
submits that the incidence of break‑ins remains at a very high level in
Canada, and that the interruption of the burglar in possession of the tools
associated with his or her unlawful trade represents an important and
significant social objective. Counsel for the Attorney General points to
statistics demonstrating that break and enter is the most common property
offence next to theft of property of a value under $200 (Statistics Canada,
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Canadian Crime Statistics 1985
(Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services Canada, 1986), table 2). Those
statistics also demonstrate a low clearance rate for property crimes in general
and break and enter offences in particular. In 1985, the break and enter
offence recorded one of the lowest clearance rates of all property crime
offences, with 78.2 per cent being unsolved in 1985 (Canadian Crime
Statistics 1985, at p. 46). It also relies on the Law Reform Commission's
Working Paper No. 48, Criminal Intrusion (1986), which, at p. 1, captures
succinctly society's interest in curbing property crimes:

 

          It is
with good reason that the paradigm of a criminal is the ""burglar.""
Break and enter is one of those offences which seem to touch each one of us. It
is rare today to find anyone who has not been a victim of a break and enter or
who does not know someone who has been. Indeed, break and enter continually
appears in police statistics as the most common property offence next to theft
of property of a value under $200. This is serious when you consider that two‑thirds
of all reported Criminal Code  offences relate to property.

 

          However,
perhaps the worst thing about break and enter is how worrying it is. This is
especially so when it happens to you in your home. An unwanted intrusion into
our homes, our private space, gives rise to feelings of fear, outrage, insult
and indignation. Somehow we feel violated. Studies confirm that ""the
victim seems threatened personally more by the disarrangement of his personal
territory than by the evident economic loss."" Insurance can compensate for
the economic loss; nothing can compensate for our feelings of fear, insult,
anger and loss of security resulting from an invasion of our privacy.

 

          While not
wishing to downplay the pressing and substantial interest in curbing this sort
of unlawful activity, and assuming that it is sufficiently weighty to justify
curbing fundamental freedoms constitutionally protected by the Charter ,
it is my view that s. 309(1)  cannot, in any event, be justified under s. 1 , by
virtue of the fact that the provision does not meet the proportionality test
enunciated in R. v. Oakes as it applies to infringements on the s. 11 (d)
right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 

          I say
this for two reasons. First, even assuming there to be a rational basis for
distinguishing between defences, s. 309(1)  does not impair ""as little as
possible"" the right or freedom in question (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 352). Parliament could have enacted a section which
does not have the effect of resulting in the possible conviction of a person
who raises a reasonable doubt at trial as to his or her guilt but is unable to
prove his or her innocence on a balance of probabilities. In other words, given
the circumstances surrounding this kind of offence and the objective of curbing
property‑related crimes, Parliament could have imposed simply an
evidential burden on the accused to introduce some evidence raising a
reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt, as it did in 1972 with respect to
defences which negate the inference that the accused intended to use the
instruments for house‑breaking purposes.

 

          Secondly,
I am of the opinion that s. 309(1)  does not meet the proportionality calculus
articulated in R. v. Oakes because of the deleterious effects which
result from imposing a persuasive burden on the accused in connection with a
criminal offence making unlawful the possession of even the most innocuous of
tools. The principle that innocent persons not be punished is the normative foundation
of the evidentiary requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. It is true
that the 1972 amendments reduced the possibility that innocent persons would be
convicted, but, in my opinion, Hall J.'s concerns in Tupper v. The Queen
remain valid. Section 309(1)  embraces and leaves open the possibility that
innocent persons will be jailed. This effect, given the range of alternative
legislative devices available to Parliament, is too deleterious to be justified
as a reasonable limit under s. 1  of the Charter .  Simply put, the
provision exacts too high a price to be justified in a free and democratic
society. As Lamer J. stated in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 486, at p. 513:

 

          It has
from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the innocent not be
punished. This principle has long been recognized as an essential element of a
system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the
dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law.

 

For the reasons
given earlier, I am of the view that s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code 
affords insufficient protection to an accused faced with the potential
segregation from society and deprivation of liberty which result from
conviction. It follows that s. 309(1) of the Code is not justified under
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

          This does
not, however, lead to the conclusion that the whole of s. 309(1)  is void.
Excising the words, ""the proof of which lies upon him"", from the
provision would eliminate the possibility of the conviction of an accused who
had a lawful excuse for his or her actions but could not prove that excuse on a
balance of probabilities. As I stated earlier, although s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
does not oblige the Crown to prove at the outset the absence of every conceivable
defence, it does require that when the facts fairly raise the possibility of a
successful defence, all that is required of an accused is to raise a reasonable
doubt as to his or her guilt. I would order that the offending words be severed
so that an accused bears only an evidential burden in this regard. As the
appellant has yet to be prosecuted under s. 309(1) , I would dismiss the appeal
and direct that the indictment continue in the ordinary way under s. 309(1) 
without the accused bearing a persuasive burden of establishing lawful excuse.

 

                                                                  VIII

 

Conclusion

 

          Clements
Co. Ct. J. was correct in holding that s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter . Moreover s. 309(1)
cannot be justified under s. 1 . Accordingly, the constitutional questions
should be answered as follows:

 

          1.Is section 309(1) of the Criminal Code 
of Canada inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: Yes, to the extent that the words, ""the
proof of which lies upon him,"" places a persuasive burden on an accused to
establish ""lawful excuse"" on a balance of probabilities.

 

          2.If so, is s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code 
of Canada justified on the basis of s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: No, to the extent that the words, ""the
proof of which lies upon him"", places a persuasive burden on the accused
to establish ""lawful excuse"" on a balance of probabilities.

 

I would dismiss the
appeal.

 

          The
reasons of McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

          McIntyre J. ‑‑ I have read the reasons for judgment of
my colleague, the Chief Justice. He has set out the facts and the issues which
arise in this case, as well as the positions taken by the parties before this
Court. I am unable, however, to agree fully with his reasons and the answers
that he has given to the constitutional questions posed. In general agreement
with the Court of Appeal, I am unable to find s. 309  of the Criminal Code 
inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
I would, therefore, answer Question l in the negative, have no occasion to
answer the second question, and I would dismiss the appeal.

 

          Section
309(1)  of the Criminal Code  is in these terms:

 

          309. (1) Every one who,
without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession
any instrument suitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor
vehicle, vault or safe under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable
inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used
for any such purpose, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.

 

The other relevant
provision, s. 11 (d) of the Charter , provides:

 

          11. Any person charged
with an offence has the right

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
tribunal;

 

The history of the
offence charged under s. 309  extends back to a mid‑nineteenth century
English statute, which was adopted in the Criminal Code  of Canada of
1892 and, after amendment, appeared in the 1953‑54 Code as s. 295 
in these terms:

 

          295. (1) Every one who
without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him, has in his possession
any instrument for house‑breaking, vault‑breaking or safe‑breaking
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen
years.

 

Amendments in 1972
and 1985 gave the section, now numbered 309, its present

form by the
addition of the words:

 

 . . . under
circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument has
been used or is or was intended to be used for any such purpose. . . .

 

The 1972 amendment
added a further element which the Crown must prove. In answer to the suggestion
made by the trial judge that these words were ambiguous and, consequently, in
contravention of the Charter , Lacourcière J.A., speaking for the
unanimous Court of Appeal (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 250 (Lacourcière, Weatherston
and Cory JJ.A.), said, at p. 255:

 

          By the
addition of the impugned wording, Parliament, in effect, was delineating the
legislative criteria for an indictable offence, where the circumstances of the
possession of the instruments suitable for house‑breaking, which can also
be used for innocent purposes, give rise to the incriminating inference. An
additional onus was placed on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the instruments were in the accused's possession under circumstances that give
rise to a reasonable inference that the instruments were intended to be used
for house‑breaking, etc. I am unable to agree with the trial judge that
the incriminating circumstances required to be proved by the Crown are couched
in ambiguity.

 

I am in full
agreement with these words.

 

          The 1972
and 1985 amendments to s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  are of fundamental
importance in this case and, in my view, render much of what

was said in earlier
judgments dealing with their predecessors of little significance. Section
309(1)  creates a complete offence; that of being in possession of any
instrument suitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor vehicle,
vault or safe under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that
the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for any such
purpose. For the Crown to procure a conviction under this section all elements
of the offence must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown's burden was
aptly stated by Martin J.A. in R. v. Kozak and Moore (1975), 20 C.C.C.
(2d) 175 (Ont. C.A.), speaking for the Court (Kelly, Martin and Lacourcière
JJ.A.), at pp. 179‑80:

 

As will be gathered
from what I have already said, it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove: (a)
possession by the accused of the instruments specified in the indictment; (b)
that they were suitable for the purpose of housebreaking, safe‑breaking
or vault‑breaking; (c) that such instruments were found under circumstances
that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instruments were intended to
be used for housebreaking, safe‑breaking or vault‑breaking.

 

In discharging this
burden of proof, the Crown must put before the court a prima facie case,
that is, evidence covering every element of the offence of such nature that, if
believed by the trier of fact and not answered, would warrant a conviction. It
was argued by the appellant that by providing that the possession must be in
circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable inference, the section was
enabling a finding of guilt on something less than proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. I would reject that argument. The words ""reasonable inference""
(of guilt) employed in a criminal enactment can mean only an inference which,
on the basis of the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would
warrant a conclusion of guilt in the absence of any answer or explanation. An
inference of guilt is not reasonable in the criminal context unless it
overrides a reasonable doubt. The burden of proof under this section must be
discharged without the benefit of any presumption against the accused. The
accused is required to prove nothing, though depending on the strength of the
Crown's evidence he might be in grave danger of conviction if he does not call
evidence in his defence or make answer to the Crown's case. In this regard the
accused, under s. 309  of the Criminal Code , is in no different position
than an accused in any other offence.

 

          It was
also argued that the inclusion of the words ""without lawful excuse, the
proof of which lies upon him"" in s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code ,
amounted to a reverse onus clause which imposed a burden on the accused to
prove his innocence, contrary to the provisions of s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
In other words, they denied him the benefit of a presumption of innocence. In
my view, these words create no such reverse onus. These words, while apt in
certain circumstances to do so, cannot be said to have any such effect in the
context of s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code , where before they can have
any effect the Crown must place before the Court a complete case for
conviction. They may be said to be little more than a recognition of the
accused's statutory right under s. 577(3)  of the Criminal Code  to make
full answer and defence. There is no provision here, similar to s. 241(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code , which deems that an accused found occupying the
seat ordinarily occupied by the driver had care and control of the vehicle.
This is not a case such as that of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1 (struck down by this Court in R. v. Oakes,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 103), which permitted upon a conviction for one offence
(possession of a narcotic) conviction for a completely different offence
(possession for the purpose of trafficking) unless the accused disproved the
intent to traffic. It may well be asked, then, why are the words included in
the statute, what purpose do they have?

 

          In my
view, before the 1972 Tupper amendment, this question would have been
answered by stating that the words ""without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him,"" were included in the section in order to make
available the defence of innocent purpose, which would not have been open to an
accused without this phrase because, in the words of the former section, the
offence was complete without consideration of purpose. On this point, I would
refer to the words of Laskin J. (as he then was) in Brownridge v. The Queen,
[1972] S.C.R. 926, at p. 950, in a concurring judgment on this point, where he
said on the subject of the construction of the words ""without reasonable
excuse"" in what is now s. 238(5)  of the Criminal Code :

 

. . . the trial
judge ruled as a matter of law that denial of an accused's request to consult a
lawyer before he would agree to give a breath sample did not provide a
reasonable excuse to an accused for refusing to give such a sample.

 

          I agree
with this ruling of the trial judge because I regard the phrase
""without reasonable excuse"" as adding a defence or a bar to
successful prosecution which would not be available without those words, but
not as encompassing defences or bars that would exist without them. For
example, a right of diplomatic immunity from the domestic criminal law would
exist regardless of the absence of the words ""without reasonable
excuse""; and similarly, in my view, if s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights sets up a bar, it is one which is independent of the
presence of the words in question. It would be strange, indeed, if the effect
of the immunity above‑mentioned or of the Canadian Bill of Rights
was vitiated by repeal of the words ""without reasonable excuse"".
[Emphasis added.]

 

The emphasized
words in the above passage were relied upon in the Ontario Court of Appeal in
construing the words ""without lawful justification or excuse"", in s.
408  of the Criminal Code , in R. v. Santeramo (1976), 32 C.C.C.
(2d) 35, at p. 44, per Brooke J.A. (leave to appeal to this Court was
granted but the appeal was discontinued before hearing). When, however, the
section was amended in 1972 to make the intention to use the instrument for
house‑breaking an essential element of the offence, the phrase
""without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies upon him"" was
rendered superfluous. The purpose for which the accused intended to use the
tools was effectively converted from a defence which the accused had to prove
to show his innocence, to an essential element of the offence which the Crown
had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to prove his guilt. As a result, then,
the phrase was denuded of its original content. It was probably retained in the
section out of an abundance of caution.

 

          The Chief
Justice has adopted the view that the phrase has not been so robbed of its
content but that it encompasses general common law excuses, such as duress and
authorization by law, which he considers must continue to be established by the
accused on a balance of probabilities. I cannot, with the utmost deference,
share that view. I would adopt the words of Laskin J. in Brownridge, supra.
The words ""without lawful excuse"" do not encompass excuses or
justifications that would exist if those words were omitted from the section,
and thus require proof by the accused. Manifestly, if the words were omitted
from the Code, general common law excuses, such as duress or
authorization by law, would continue to be available to the accused. The
conclusion that these general common law excuses are not encompassed within the
phrase ""without lawful excuse"", entails the further conclusion that
these excuses need not be proved on a balance of probabilities since they are
not affected by the words ""the proof of which lies upon him"".
Consequently, these excuses are, and have always been, with respect to this
offence, available to an accused on exactly the same basis as they are in any
other criminal offence: as long as the accused can raise a reasonable doubt, he
is entitled to an acquittal.

 

          In any
event, even accepting the proposition stated by the Chief Justice that
""where an accused seeks to raise a defence absolving him or her of
liability despite proof of actus reus and mens rea beyond a
reasonable doubt, [such as duress, or authorization by law], s. 309(1) , like
its predecessor, still requires the accused to establish such a defence on a
balance of probabilities"", this requirement would involve no infringement
of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  guaranteeing the right to be presumed
innocent unless proven guilty according to law. Defences or excuses of this
nature can only be raised where the offence has been proved: see Bergstrom
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 539, at p. 544, and see, as well, Mewett and
Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985), at p. 194. Indeed, as has been
observed above, the Chief Justice has limited his concerns specifically to such
cases.

 

          Where,
then, as in the case at bar, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is
required without the benefit of any presumption before any need for defence
arises, s. 11 (d) of the Charter  has not been offended. There has
been no denial of the presumption of innocence. It has been overcome by proof
according to law or by admissions of the accused, and the defence or excuse
which is sought to be raised depends upon that fact. If he is convicted in the
face of such a defence, it is not because he has been presumed guilty or
because the commission of the crime has not been shown, but because his excuse
was rejected after proof of the commission of the offence. An accused raising
such a defence or excuse is not seeking relief because of an absence of guilt.
He seeks relief despite his commission of the offence. It may be of interest to
note that s. 17  of the Criminal Code , in defining the defence of
compulsion, provides that the accused is ""excused for committing the
offence"" (emphasis added). Where the offence is proved beyond a
reasonable doubt, according to law, without the aid of any presumption, I
cannot conclude that the accused has been denied the benefit of the presumption
of innocence only because his excuse for his commission of the offence is not
accepted. I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal and I would answer the first
constitutional question in the negative and not answer the second.

 

          The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

          La Forest J. ‑‑ I have had the advantage of reading the
judgments of the Chief Justice and McIntyre J. I am in agreement with the
interpretation given s. 309(1)  of the Criminal Code  by McIntyre J. So
interpreted, the section does not conflict with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal,
answer the first constitutional question

in the negative and
not answer the second constitutional question.

on appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Abuse of process ‑‑ Two juries unable to reach
verdict ‑‑ Crown proceeding to third trial ‑‑ No
prosecutorial misconduct ‑‑ Whether or not third trial would
constitute abuse of process ‑‑ Whether or not prosecutorial
misconduct essential element of abuse of process.

 

                   Appellant's
first two trials on a charge of criminal negligence causing death ended with
the juries failing to agree on a verdict. A third trial was stayed by the trial
judge on the grounds that it would constitute both an abuse of process and a
violation of s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The
Crown's appeal was allowed by a majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
and a new trial ordered. At issue here is whether a series of trials could per
se constitute an abuse of process or whether it is necessary for the
accused to show prosecutorial misconduct.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   A
stay of proceedings to remedy an abuse of process is available where the
proceedings are ""oppressive or vexatious"", but such power can be
exercised only in the ""clearest of cases"". To define
""oppressive"" as requiring misconduct or an improper motive would
unduly restrict the operation of the doctrine of abuse of process.
Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation, if present, are but two of
many factors to be taken into account when a court is called upon to consider
whether or not in a particular case the Crown's exercise of its discretion to
re‑lay the indictment amounts to an abuse of process.

 

                   The
administration of justice would be best served in this case by allowing the
Crown to proceed with the new trial. The appellant had not demonstrated this to
be one of those ""clearest of cases"" which would justify a stay.

Freedoms . The Crown's appeal was allowed by a majority of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal ((1986), 49 Sask. R. 64 ) and a new trial ordered. Bayda C.J.S.
dissented. This is an appeal as of right.

 

2.                       The
availability of a stay of proceedings to remedy an abuse of process was
confirmed by this Court in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128. On that
occasion the Court stated that the test for abuse of process was that initially
formulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Young (1984), 40 C.R.
(3d) 289. A stay should be granted where ""compelling an accused to stand
trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the
community's sense of fair play and decency"", or where the proceedings are
""oppressive or vexatious"" ([1985] 2 S.C.R. at pp. 136‑37). The
Court in Jewitt also adopted ""the caveat added by the Court in Young
that this is a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of
cases'"" (p. 137).

 

3.                       The
legal issue on the appeal is a very narrow one, namely whether a series of
trials could per se constitute an abuse of process or whether it is
necessary for the accused to show prosecutorial misconduct. The majority of the
Court of Appeal expressed the view that the accused had to establish
prosecutorial misconduct. Vancise J.A., writing for the majority, stated at p.
68:

 

                   In the absence of evidence that the
legal officers of the Crown were guilty of prosecutorial misconduct or
proceeded for [sic] some ulterior motive, in short that the proceedings
were oppressive, the continuation of the trial on the indictment is not an
abuse of process.

 

To define
""oppressive"" as requiring misconduct or an improper motive would, in
my view, unduly restrict the operation of the doctrine. In this case, for
example, where there is no suggestion of misconduct, such a definition would
prevent any limit being placed on the number of trials that could take place.
Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation are but two of many factors to
be taken into account when a court is called upon to consider whether or not in
a particular case the Crown's exercise of its discretion to re‑lay the
indictment amounts to an abuse of process.

 

4.                       While
I disagree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that prosecutorial
misconduct must be demonstrated in order to give rise to an abuse of process, I
nevertheless agree with their conclusion that a new trial was properly ordered
in this case. The appellant has, in my view, failed to demonstrate that this is
one of those ""clearest of cases"" which would justify a stay. The
charge is a serious one. The proceedings have not occupied an undue amount of
time. The accused has not been held in custody, and, while he has undoubtedly
suffered substantial trauma and stigma from the proceedings and the attendant
publicity, he is probably not distinguishable in this respect from the vast
majority of accused. A third trial may, indeed, stretch the limits of the
community's sense of fair play but does not of itself exceed them. In these
circumstances, and having regard to the seriousness of the charge, I think that
the administration of justice is best served by allowing the Crown to proceed
with the new trial.

 

5.                       A
brief comment on s. 7  of the Charter . The parties to this appeal were
agreed that the common law doctrine of abuse of process was now subsumed in s.
7 . The trial judge accepted this proposition as did all the members of the
Court of Appeal although in neither of the courts below was there much analysis
of the relationship between the two. Bayda C.J.S., however, noted, at pp. 74‑75,
what he saw as a potential difference in onus:

 

Counsel for the Attorney General conceded‑‑and
rightly so‑‑that if the circumstances of the present case justly
give rise to a finding of an abuse of process, they would automatically give
rise to a finding of violation of s. 7 . The converse should also be true but
for the matter of onus. Had this case been decided on the basis of s. 7 , it
would have been sufficient for the accused to prove on the balance of
probabilities a violation of ""the principles of fundamental
justice"" as that phrase is used in s.
7  . . . . By deciding the case on the basis of
""abuse of process"", it would appear necessary to apply the
""clearest of cases"" onus (the Young‑Jewitt test) in
determining whether that same violation of ""the principles of fundamental
justice"" occurred. I am unable to give a valid explanation for the
distinction in onus. [Emphasis in original.]

 

6.                       Despite
the references to s. 7  in the judgments below, counsel before this Court did
not address the s. 7  issue in either written or oral argument. For that reason
I would prefer to leave the issue of the relationship between s. 7  and the
common law doctrine of abuse of process to another day.

 

7.                       I
would dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellant
was stopped at random in a spot check by police; there had been nothing unusual
about his driving. The spot check was for the purposes of checking licences,
insurance, mechanical fitness of cars and sobriety of the drivers with the only
guideline being that at least one marked police vehicle be engaged in spot
check duty. There were no criteria, standards, guidelines or procedures to
determine which vehicles should be stopped. It was in the discretion of the police
officer.

 

                   The
officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance
and verified their validity. When the officer detected the odour of alcohol on
the appellant's breath and noticed that his speech was slightly slurred, the
officer requested appellant to accompany him to his vehicle where he made a
formal demand for a breath sample for a roadside breathalyzer test. When
appellant refused, the officer informed him that he would be charged with
refusing to provide a breath sample and informed him of his right to retain and
instruct counsel without delay. Section 234.1  of the Criminal Code  was
in force in Ontario at the time but it had not been proclaimed in British
Columbia or Quebec.

 

                   Appellant
was found guilty in provincial court of refusing to comply with the officer's
demand, contrary to s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code . Both the County
Court and the Court of Appeal upheld this verdict. The issues addressed in the
constitutional questions stated by this Court were: (1) whether the non‑universal
proclamation of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  infringed the right to
equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights; (2) whether the random stopping of motor vehicles by police
officers pursuant to federal and/or provincial statute infringed the right to
not be arbitrarily detained guaranteed by s. 9  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ; (3) if so, whether such statutorily permitted conduct
was justified by s. 1  of the Charter ; (4) whether the right to be secure
against unreasonable search as guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter  was
infringed by the ""spot check"" procedure; (5) if so, whether such
statutorily permitted conduct was justified by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed. The first constitutional question should be answered in the
negative, the second and third in the affirmative, and the fourth in the
negative. It was not necessary to answer the fifth constitutional question.

 

                   The
non‑universal proclamation of the former s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code 
was determined in R. v. Cornell not to infringe the right to equality
before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

                   The
random stopping of the appellant for the purposes of the spot check procedure,
although of relatively brief duration, resulted in appellant's being detained
within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter . The police officer, by the
random stop, assumed control over the movement of the appellant by a demand or
direction that might have significant legal consequence, and there was penal
liability for refusal to comply with the demand or direction.

 

                   Appellant
was arbitrarily detained, within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter , as
a result of the random stop for the purposes of the spot check procedure.
Although the stop had statutory authority and lawful purposes, there were no
criteria for the selection of the drivers to be stopped and subjected to the
spot check procedure. The selection was in the absolute discretion of the
police officer. A discretion is arbitrary if there are no criteria, express or
implied, which govern its exercise.

 

                   A
limit prescribed by law on the right not to be arbitrarily detained arose by
implication from the terms of s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.
In view of the importance of highway safety and the role to be played in
relation to it by a random stop authority for the purpose of increasing both
the detection and the perceived risk of detection of motor vehicle offences,
many of which cannot be detected by the mere observation of driving, the limit
imposed by s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act on the right not
to be arbitrarily detained is a reasonable one that is demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society, within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter .
The nature and degree of the intrusion of a random stop for the purposes of the
spot check procedure, remembering that the driving of a motor vehicle is a
licensed activity subject to regulation and control in the interests of safety,
is proportionate to the purpose to be served. If the stopping of motor vehicles
for such purposes is not to be seriously inhibited, it should not be subjected
to the kinds of conditions or restrictions reflected in the American
jurisprudence, which would appear seriously to undermine its effectiveness
while not significantly reducing its intrusiveness. As for publicity, it may be
taken now that the public is well aware of random stop authority both because
of its frequent and widespread exercise and its recognition by legislatures.
The random stop of the appellant for the purposes of the spot check procedure
was therefore a justified interference with the right not to be arbitrarily
detained.

 

                   The
demand by the police officer, made pursuant to legislative provisions, that the
appellant surrender his driver's licence and insurance card for inspection did
not constitute a search within the meaning of s. 8  of the Charter 
because it did not constitute an intrusion on a reasonable expectation of
privacy. There is no such intrusion where a person is required to produce a
licence or permit or other documentary evidence of a status or compliance with
some legal requirement that is a lawful condition of the exercise of a right or
privilege.

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                       Le Dain J.‑‑This
appeal raises the following questions:

 

1.                Whether
the non‑universal proclamation of the former s. 234.1  of the Criminal
Code , respecting mandatory roadside breath testing, as a result of which s.
234.1  was not in force in the provinces of British Columbia and Quebec,
infringed the right to equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of
the Canadian Bill of Rights;

 

2.                Whether
the random stop of a motor vehicle by a police officer in the course of
""spot check duty"" for the purposes of checking driver's licences and
proof of insurance, the mechanical fitness of vehicles and the condition or
""sobriety"" of drivers infringed the right not to be arbitrarily
detained guaranteed by s. 9  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ;
and

 

3.                Whether
the spot check procedure, whereby the police officer required the surrender for
inspection of the driver's licence and insurance card, infringed the right to
be secure against unreasonable search guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter .

 

2.                       The
appeal is by leave of this Court from the judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal on September 18, 1984, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Kane
Co. Ct. J. on November 2, 1983, which dismissed an appeal from the conviction
of the appellant by Camblin Prov. Ct. J. on May 2, 1983 of failing or refusing,
without reasonable excuse, to comply with a demand by a police officer to
provide a sample of breath into a roadside screening device contrary to s.
234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                                                                     I

 

3.                       On
January 14, 1983, at approximately 12:30 a.m., the appellant was stopped by a
police officer while driving north on Midland Avenue in the municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto. The officer testified that when he stopped the appellant
he did not notice anything unusual about the appellant's driving and that the
appellant was driving in a normal manner. The officer asked to see the
appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance and verified their
validity. During the course of his conversation with the appellant the officer
detected the odour of alcohol on the appellant's breath and noticed that his
speech was slightly slurred. The officer requested the appellant to accompany
him to his vehicle for the purpose of a roadside breath test, and at
approximately 12:36 a.m. the officer made a formal demand upon the appellant to
provide a sample of breath into the approved roadside screening device known as
A.L.E.R.T. (Alcohol Level Evaluation Roadside Tester) Model J3A. The appellant
refused to do so. Upon his refusal the officer informed the appellant that he
would be charged with the offence of refusing to provide a sample of breath and
informed him of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The
appellant was released upon an appearance notice at approximately 1:05 a.m.

 

4.                       When
he stopped the appellant the officer was engaged, beginning about 11:30 p.m. on
January 13, 1983, in a police spot check of motor vehicles and drivers on
Midland Avenue, north of Lawrence Avenue. He described the ""spot check
duty"" as follows: ""That is what they call it when we have certain
vehicles, officers included, for the purposes of stopping vehicles, checking
the mechanical fitness of the vehicle and the conditions of the drivers at the
time."" He agreed with counsel that the purpose of spot check duty was to
""check licences, insurance, mechanical fitness of cars and sobriety of the
owners."" The officer also agreed that it was common to check the ownership
of the vehicle to make sure that it had not been stolen but he could not recall
whether he had done so in this case. The officer testified that the only
guideline for spot check duty was that there must be at least one marked police
vehicle. Other vehicles engaged in spot check duty could be marked or unmarked.
There were no criteria, standards, guidelines or procedures to determine which
vehicles should be stopped. It was in the discretion of the police officer. The
officer who stopped the appellant was in uniform at the time but in an unmarked
car. He testified that he was stopping vehicles ""at random"". He said
that during the previous eight months, during which he had been assigned spot
check duties, he had pulled over approximately five hundred vehicles and had
administered roadside breath tests in approximately twenty cases. He said that
the appellant's vehicle was one of several he had pulled over during the course
of his shift.

 

5.                       On
the charge of failing or refusing, without reasonable excuse, to comply with
the demand by the police officer to provide a sample of breath into the
roadside screening device, contrary to s. 234.1(2)  of the Criminal Code ,
the appellant contended before Camblin Prov. Ct. J. that the charge should be
dismissed on the grounds, among others, that the non‑universal
proclamation of s. 234.1  infringed the right to equality before the law recognized
by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights and that the random
stop and spot check procedure infringed the rights to be secure against
unreasonable search and not to be arbitrarily detained guaranteed by ss. 8  and
9  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The provincial court
judge rejected these contentions, convicted the appellant and fined him $100.
The appeal from this judgment was dismissed by Kane Co. Ct. J. without reasons.

 

6.                       The
appeal from the judgment of Kane Co. Ct. J. was dismissed by the Ontario Court
of Appeal (Howland C.J.O., Martin and Blair JJ.A.) (1984), 14 O.A.C. 1, for the
following reasons in the endorsement of Howland C.J.O.:

 

Counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of
appeal:

 

                   1. His first contention was that
s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  ... was inoperative because it had not
been proclaimed in British Columbia or Quebec and so infringed the right of the
appellant to equality before the law in s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights . . . .

 

                   We are unable to accept this
submission. We consider that the reasoning of this court in R. v. Negridge
(1980), 6 M.V.R. 255, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304 (Ont. C.A.), is
conclusive on this point.

 

                   2. The second contention was
that the appellant was arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . We consider that this contention has been
disposed of by the decisions of this court in R. v. Simmons (1984), 3
O.A.C. 1; 45 O.R. (2d) 609; 26 M.V.R. 168; 39 C.R. (3d) 223; 11 C.C.C. (3d)
193; 7 D.L.R. (4th) 719 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Dedman (1981), 32 O.R.
(2d) 641; 10 M.V.R. 59; 23 C.R. (3d) 228; 59 C.C.C. (2d) 97; 122 D.L.R. (3d)
655 (Ont. C.A.).

 

                   3. The third contention was that
asking the appellant to produce his driver's licence and proof of insurance was
an unreasonable search contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

 

                   We are all of the view that there was
no unreasonable search in light of the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 198 requiring such production, which provisions we consider to
be reasonable.

 

7.                       On
the appeal to this Court the following constitutional questions were stated by
Estey J. in his order of January 8, 1987:

 

1.                Does the non‑universal
proclamation of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  of Canada abrogate,
abridge or infringe the appellant's right to equality before the law as
provided by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

2.                Does the random stopping of motor
vehicles by police officers pursuant to federal and/or provincial statute
infringe the right to not be arbitrarily detained as guaranteed by s. 9  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

3.                If the answer to question 2 above
is in the affirmative, is such statutorily permitted conduct justified by s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

4.                Was the appellant's right to be
secure against unreasonable search as guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  infringed by the ""spot check""
procedure employed by the investigating officer herein?

 

5.                If the answer to question 4 above
is in the affirmative, is such statutorily permitted conduct justified by s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

                                                                    II

 

8.                       The
first issue in the appeal is whether the non‑universal proclamation of
the former s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code , pursuant to s. 102(3) of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1975, S.C. 1974‑75‑76, c. 93, as a result of
which s. 234.1  was in force in Ontario at the time the appellant was charged
but was not in force in British Columbia and Quebec, infringed the right to
equality before the law recognized by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights. That question was considered and determined by the Court in R.
v. Cornell, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 461, which was heard at the same time as this
appeal. For the reasons given in Cornell, the non‑universal
proclamation of s. 234.1  was justified by a valid federal objective and
therefore did not infringe s. 1 (b). The first constitutional question
should accordingly be answered in the negative.

 

                                                                   III

 

9.                       The
second issue in the appeal is whether the random stop of the appellant's motor
vehicle resulted in the appellant's being arbitrarily detained within the
meaning of s. 9  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which
provides:

 

                   9. Everyone has the right not to be
arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.

 

10.                     The
second constitutional question refers to ""the random stopping of motor
vehicles by police officers pursuant to federal and/or provincial
statute."" The statutory provision relied on by the respondent as authority
for the random stop of the appellant for the purposes contemplated by the spot
check procedure is s. 189a of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 198, as amended by s. 2 of the Highway Traffic Amendment
Act, 1981 (No. 3), S.O. 1981, c. 72. Sections 189a(1) and (2) are as
follows:

 

                   189a.‑‑(1) A
police officer, in the lawful execution of his duties and responsibilities, may
require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop and the driver of a motor
vehicle, when signalled or requested to stop by a police officer who is readily
identifiable as such, shall immediately come to a safe stop.

 

                   (2) Every person who contravenes
subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to a fine of
not less than $100 and not more than $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term of
not more than six months, or to both.

 

In the course of
oral argument reference was also made to s. 30a of the Highway
Traffic Act, as amended by s. 1 of the Highway Traffic Amendment Act,
1981 (No. 3), which provides for the surrender and suspension of a driver's
licence in certain cases following a demand for a sample of breath under s.
234.1(1)  or s. 235(1)  of the Criminal Code . Section 30a(1)  reads
as follows:

 

                   30a.‑‑(1) A
police officer, readily identifiable as such, may require the driver of a motor
vehicle to stop for the purpose of determining whether or not there is evidence
to justify making a demand under section 234.1  of the Criminal Code 
(Canada).

 

It was not
contended that there was federal statutory authority for the random stop, as
distinct from the s. 234.1(1)  demand, nor was reliance placed on the common law
authority for a random stop affirmed in Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 2, although the reasoning in Dedman was referred to by the
respondent in support of the constitutionality of the random stop authority
conferred by the Highway Traffic Act.

 

11.                     Reference
may also be made at this point to the provincial legislative provisions
requiring the surrender for inspection of a driver's licence and insurance card
upon the demand of a police officer. They are s. 19(1) of the Highway
Traffic Act and s. 3(1) of the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 83, which, at the time the appellant was stopped, read as
follows:

 

                   19.‑‑(1) Every driver of
a motor vehicle shall carry his licence with him at all times while he is in
charge of a motor vehicle and shall surrender the licence for reasonable
inspection upon the demand of a constable or officer appointed for carrying out
the provisions of this Act.

 

                   3.‑‑(1) An operator of
a motor vehicle on a highway shall have in the motor vehicle at all times,

 

(a)               an insurance card for the
motor vehicle; or

 

(b)               an insurance card
evidencing that the operator is insured under a contract of automobile
insurance,

 

and the operator shall surrender the insurance card for
reasonable inspection upon the demand of a police officer.

 

12.                     The
first issue with respect to the appellant's contention based on s. 9  of the Charter 
is whether the random stop of the appellant for the purposes of the spot check
procedure‑‑in this case, to check the driver's licence and proof of
insurance and to observe his condition or ""sobriety""‑‑resulted
in a detention of the appellant within the meaning of s. 9 . I refer to the
period during which the appellant was stopped for the purposes of the spot
check procedure, as distinct from the period following the s. 234.1(1)  demand.
In my opinion the random stop of the appellant for the purposes of the spot
check procedure, although of relatively brief duration, resulted in a detention
of the appellant within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter . It fell
within the general concept of detention that was applied in  R. v. Therens,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, and reaffirmed by the Court in R. v. Thomsen,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, which was heard at the same time as this appeal and in
which judgment has been rendered today. By the random stop for the purposes of
the spot check procedure the police officer assumed control over the movement
of the appellant by a demand or direction that might have significant legal
consequence, and there was penal liability for refusal to comply with the
demand or direction. Although Therens and Thomsen were concerned
with the meaning of ""detention"" in s. 10  of the Charter , there
is, in my opinion, no reason in principle why the general approach to the
meaning of detention reflected in those cases should not be applied to the
meaning of ""detained"" in s. 9 . The further restraint of liberty as a
result of the s. 234.1(1)  demand was also a detention, as was held in Thomsen,
but that demand was not based directly on random choice, as was the stop for
purposes of the spot check procedure, but on a reasonable suspicion, formed as
a result of the observation of the appellant in the course of the spot check
procedure, that the appellant had alcohol in his blood.

 

13.                     The
next issue with respect to the appellant's contention based on s. 9  of the Charter 
is whether the detention resulting from the random stop for the purposes of the
spot check procedure was arbitrary within the meaning of s. 9 . Section 189a(1)
of the Highway Traffic Act empowers a police officer who is in the
lawful execution of his duties and responsibilities to require the driver of a
motor vehicle to stop. It does not specify that there must be some grounds or
cause for stopping a particular driver but on its face leaves the choice of the
drivers to be stopped to the discretion of the officer. In carrying out the
purposes of the spot check procedure, including the observation of the
condition or ""sobriety"" of the driver, the officer was clearly in the
lawful execution of his duties and responsibilities. Although authorized by
statute and carried out for lawful purposes, the random stop for the purposes
of the spot check procedure nevertheless resulted, in my opinion, in an
arbitrary detention because there were no criteria for the selection of the
drivers to be stopped and subjected to the spot check procedure. The selection
was in the absolute discretion of the police officer. A discretion is arbitrary
if there are no criteria, express or implied, which govern its exercise. The
appellant was therefore arbitrarily detained, within the meaning of s. 9  of the
Charter , as a result of the random stop for the purposes of the spot
check procedure, and the second constitutional question should accordingly be
answered in the affirmative.

 

                                                                   IV

 

14.                     It
is necessary then to consider whether the right not to be arbitrarily detained,
guaranteed by s. 9  of the Charter , is subject, in the case of the
authority to stop motor vehicles conferred by s. 189a(1) of the Highway
Traffic Act, to a reasonable limit prescribed by law that is demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter ,
which provides:

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it
subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society.

 

15.                     As
indicated in Therens and Thomsen, a limit prescribed by law,
within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter , may arise by implication from
the terms of a legislative provision or its operating requirements. There is,
in my opinion, the implication of a limit on the right not to be arbitrarily
detained arising from the terms of s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic
Act, which confers an authority on a police officer to choose, in his
absolute discretion, the drivers of motor vehicles whom he will require to
stop. In other words, it authorizes the random stop of motor vehicles.

 

16.                     The
question then is whether the limit imposed by s. 189a(1) of the Highway
Traffic Act on the right not to be arbitrarily detained is a reasonable one
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, within the meaning of
s. 1  of the Charter . The test for determining that question was
formulated in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, and restated by Dickson
C.J. in R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, as
follows at pp. 768‑69:

 

                   Two requirements must be satisfied to
establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society. First, the legislative objective which the limitation is
designed to promote must be of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutional right. It must bear on a ""pressing and substantial
concern"". Second, the means chosen to attain those objectives must be
proportional or appropriate to the ends. The proportionality requirement, in
turn, normally has three aspects: the limiting measures must be carefully
designed, or rationally connected, to the objective; they must impair the right
as little as possible; and their effects must not so severely trench on
individual or group rights that the legislative objective, albeit important, is
nevertheless outweighed by the abridgement of rights. The Court stated that the
nature of the proportionality test would vary depending on the circumstances.
Both in articulating the standard of proof and in describing the criteria
comprising the proportionality requirement the Court has been careful to avoid
rigid and inflexible standards.

 

17.                     The
section 1  material that was placed before the Court by the respondent on the
issue of arbitrary detention falls into two parts. The first consists of the
material in volumes I to VII inclusive on the problem of impaired driving which
was considered and applied by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Seo
(1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 385, and by this Court in Thomsen, in concluding
that the limit imposed by s. 234.1(1)  of the Criminal Code  on the right
to counsel was justified under s. 1  of the Charter . That material would
appear to have been introduced by the respondent in this appeal primarily in
justification of the detention resulting from the s. 234.1(1)  demand. The
conclusions that were drawn from that material by Finlayson J.A. in Seo
were adopted by this Court in Thomsen, and they need not be restated
here. It is sufficient to note what would appear to be of particular relevance
in the material to the justification of a random stop authority. What the
material emphasizes is not only the seriousness of impaired driving, but the
difficulty of detecting it by observation of the driving and the importance, in
order to increase the effective deterrence of it, of increasing the perceived
risk of its detection. The material refers at several places to the random stop
or spot check of drivers as calculated to increase the perceived risk of the
detection of impairment because it affords a police officer a closer
opportunity for observation of a driver's condition. It is seen as a means of
making mandatory roadside breath testing more effective.

 

18.                     What
may be regarded as the second part of the s. 1  material is contained in volumes
VIII to X inclusive and in appendices to the respondent's factum. It consists
of the following material: legislation in other provinces and democratic
jurisdictions conferring authority to require the driver of a motor vehicle to
stop; other legislation in Ontario conferring authority to stop motor vehicles
""without articulable cause""; provisions of the Highway Traffic Act
and Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act the violation of which occur
""without any necessary external or visible manifestations"";
provincial government reports for several years containing statistical analysis
of motor vehicle accidents, motor vehicle offences, suspension of driver's
licences, and claims on the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund; and charts or
tables collating the statistical data with reference to what the respondent
submitted were the indications of particular relevance to the justification of
a random stop authority.

 

19.                     The
above material reinforces the impression of the gravity of the problem of motor
vehicle accidents in terms of the resulting deaths, personal injury and
property damage, and the overriding importance of the effective enforcement of
the motor vehicle laws and regulations in the interests of highway safety. The
charts or tables prepared by the respondent from the statistical data in the
government reports stress the following points: the relative importance of
licence suspension and the effective enforcement of it; the relatively higher
proportion of unlicensed and uninsured drivers, by comparison with the
proportion of licensed and insured drivers, involved in motor vehicle accidents
resulting in death or personal injury; and the relative importance of the motor
vehicle offences, including driving without a licence or while under licence
suspension or without insurance, which cannot be detected by observation of the
driving. Again, a random stop authority is said to be justified by increasing
the perceived risk of the detection of such offences.

 

20.                     In
view of the importance of highway safety and the role to be played in relation
to it by a random stop authority for the purpose of increasing both the
detection and the perceived risk of detection of motor vehicle offences, many
of which cannot be detected by mere observation of driving, I am of the opinion
that the limit imposed by s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act
on the right not to be arbitrarily detained guaranteed by s. 9  of the Charter 
is a reasonable one that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. The nature and degree of the intrusion of a random stop for the
purposes of the spot check procedure in the present case, remembering that the
driving of a motor vehicle is a licensed activity subject to regulation and
control in the interests of safety, is proportionate to the purpose to be
served. If the stopping of motor vehicles for such purposes is not to be
seriously inhibited, it should not, in my respectful opinion, be subjected to
the kinds of conditions or restrictions reflected in the American jurisprudence
(cf. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), and Little v. State,
479 A.2d 903 (Md. 1984)), which would appear seriously to undermine its
effectiveness while not significantly reducing its intrusiveness. As for
publicity, which was referred to in Dedman in connection with common law
authority for a random stop for the purposes contemplated by the R.I.D.E.
program, I think it may be taken now that the public is well aware of random
stop authority both because of its frequent and widespread exercise and its
recognition by legislatures.

 

21.                     For
the above reasons I am of the opinion that the random stop of the appellant for
the purposes of the spot check procedure was a justified interference with the
right not to be arbitrarily detained guaranteed by s. 9  of the Charter ,
and I would accordingly answer the third constitutional question in the
affirmative.

 

                                                                    V

 

22.                     The
final issue in the appeal is whether, as contended by the appellant, the demand
by the police officer that the appellant surrender his driver's licence and
insurance card for inspection, as required by s. 19(1) of the Highway
Traffic Act and s. 3(1) of the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act,
infringed the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure
guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter , which is as follows:

 

                   8. Everyone has the right to be
secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

 

23.                     The
appellant contended that the compelled production of his driver's licence and
insurance card constituted a search within the meaning of s. 8  and that it was
an unreasonable search because there were no criteria or guidelines for
determining when a driver should be required to surrender these documents for
inspection. In my opinion the demand by the police officer, pursuant to the
above legislative provisions, that the appellant surrender his driver's licence
and insurance card for inspection did not constitute a search within the
meaning of s. 8  because it did not constitute an intrusion on a reasonable
expectation of privacy. Cf. Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145.
There is no such intrusion where a person is required to produce a licence or
permit or other documentary evidence of a status or compliance with some legal
requirement that is a lawful condition of the exercise of a right or privilege.
There was therefore no infringement of the right to be secure against unreasonable
search or seizure, and I would accordingly answer the fourth constitutional
question in the negative.

 

24.                     For
the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal and answer the constitutional
questions as follows:

 

1.                Does the non‑universal
proclamation of s. 234.1  of the Criminal Code  of Canada abrogate,
abridge or infringe the appellant's right to equality before the law as
provided by s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights?

 

Answer: No.

 

2.                Does the random stopping of motor
vehicles by police officers pursuant to federal and/or provincial statute
infringe the right to not be arbitrarily detained as guaranteed by s. 9  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

3.                If the answer to question 2 above
is in the affirmative, is such statutorily permitted conduct justified by s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

4.                Was the appellant's right to be
secure against unreasonable search as guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  infringed by the ""spot check""
procedure employed by the investigating officer herein?

 

Answer: No.

 

5.                If the answer to question 4 above
is in the affirmative, is such statutorily permitted conduct justified by s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Answer: It is not
necessary to answer this question.

 

                   Appeal
dismissed. The first constitutional question should be answered in the
negative, the second and third in the affirmative, and the fourth in the
negative. It was not necessary to answer the fifth constitutional question.

1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑We
are all of the view that a proper construction of the law relating to the
description of the manner of interception, in an authorization under the Criminal
Code , is to be found in the words of Estey J. in the Wiretap Reference,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, at p. 728, where he stated:

 

The manner of interception may be expressed in very
specific terms in one order, whereas the court in another order may authorize
the use of several or all of the devices enumerated in Part IV.1, leaving open
to the investigative agency the choice between these devices, and the choice
between wiretapping with or without interference with equipment inside the
premises, or radio surveillance by electromagnetic devices, or a combination of
these and other devices.

 

and in Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633,
at p. 671, where he said:

 

The judge may in response to such application issue an
order in broad terms, as was done here, or may particularize a type of device
or devices and their mode of employment. Either type of order is foreseen by
the wording of ss. 178.12(1)(e) and 178.13(2)(c); that is,
""generally describe the manner of interception that may be used"".

 

This is
determinative of the issue in this case. The question as to limitation of place
of interception was not properly before us and is not dealt with.

invite our brother, Justice Lamer, to deliver the judgment of the Court.

 

2.                       Lamer J.‑‑There
are, in the case at bar, grave allegations and evidence to support them which,
although not conclusive, nonetheless cast serious doubt on the integrity of the
conduct of the Crown and the police in this matter. The allegations include an
allegation that one or more police officers and/or the Crown did not reveal to
the court the fact that a Crown witness had perjured himself and misled the
court by denying the existence of promises of a pardon which they had indeed
made to him; and an allegation that, notwithstanding an order excluding the
witnesses, a police officer recorded the testimony and gave the cassettes to
this witness‑accomplice from day to day. The Court of Appeal should not,
with respect, in view of these special circumstances, have refused to allow
appellant to complete his evidence in support thereof. The Court of Appeal also
erred afterward in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

 

3.                       For
these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is
set aside and a new trial is ordered. With respect to the application for a
stay of proceedings and exemplary damages, it would be preferable for it to be
made to the trial judge or a judge of the same court, where the necessary
evidence in support of these applications can be adduced.

under s. 1 of Charter.

 

                   The
accused had consensual sexual intercourse five times with a thirteen‑year‑old
girl between December 31, 1981 and February 24, 1982 and had himself turned
sixteen years of age on January 14, 1982. He was convicted of having sexual
intercourse with a female person who was at the time under the age of fourteen
years and who was not his wife contrary to s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code .
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , although not in force when
the alleged criminal conduct took place, was in force at the time of the
accused's trial. At trial, the judge dismissed a motion to quash the
information based on the statutory denial of a defence based on mistake of fact
concerning the girl's age and the accused pleaded guilty. The Court of Appeal
upheld the conviction. At issue here is whether (a) the accused can invoke the Charter 
when his conduct took place before the Charter  came into force; (b) s.
146(1)  infringes s. 7  of the Charter ; and (c) to the extent that s.
146(1)  infringes s. 7 , whether it is saved by s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Held
(Lamer,
Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: Section 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  is not applicable to s. 146(1)  of the Criminal
Code  because its application in this case would be a retrospective one. The
words ""whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or
more"" in s. 146(1)  define, at the time the offence is committed, one of
the constituent elements of the offence, the requisite mens rea, rather
than deny to the accused, at the time of trial, a defence which he might
otherwise have had. The so‑called ""defence"" of mistake of fact,
which is removed by the above words, serves to raise a reasonable doubt as to
the existence of the requisite mens rea. Thus the removal of the
""defence"" of mistake of fact by the words ""whether or not he
believes that she is fourteen years of age or more"" in s. 146(1)  merely
indicates that the offence, as defined, does not include that particular mental
state in its mens rea.

 

                   The
criminal liability to imprisonment for the offence created by s. 146(1)  is
imposed at the time the offence is committed. The liability imposed by law
would ordinarily be established at trial in a particular case in accordance
with the relevant substantive law, including any applicable constitutional
provisions, as it existed at the time the offence was committed. It would give
a retrospective application to s. 7  of the Charter  to apply it to s.
146(1) of the Code merely because the liability imposed by s. 146(1) 
continued after the Charter  came into force. It would be to change the
applicable substantive law with retrospective effect.

 

                   Per Lamer, Wilson and
L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. (dissenting): The structure of s. 7  of the Charter 
militates against having the protection of that right hinge upon whether the Charter 
was in force at the time of the accused's conduct. Rather, the section is
directed to the point of time at which someone is about to be deprived of his
or her life, liberty or security of the person. It is the projected deprivation,
and not the conduct giving rise to the charge, which triggers the application
of s. 7 .

 

                   A
distinction is made at common law between matters of substance and matters of
procedure for the purpose of determining whether retrospective effect should be
given to new or amending legislation. Section 7  presents difficulty in
characterization for this purpose because it enshrines both procedural and
substantive rights. The appellant, however, in this case is not seeking a
retrospective application of the Charter  but rather a prospective one to
determine his rights at trial.

 

                   The
decision as to whether Charter  provisions operate retrospectively should
mirror the common law. Just as at common law procedural Acts apply to pre‑enactment
conduct, procedural rights guaranteed by the Charter  should apply to any
post‑Charter  proceeding regardless of when the underlying conduct
took place. The rights in issue here are proceeding‑oriented and direct
an application to post‑Charter  proceedings. Whether this is true
of substantive rights guaranteed by the Charter  will depend on whether
these rights expressly direct or necessarily imply that they apply to pre‑Charter 
conduct. A blanket rule cannot be adopted for all the provisions of the Charter .
They must be considered individually.

 

                   Section
146(1)  violates s. 7  of the Charter  in that it attaches criminal
liability on pain of imprisonment to conduct that is not only lacking in mens
rea but is also non‑negligent. An accused can be convicted under the
section even though he can show that he made an honest and reasonable mistake
about the victim's age. This is not in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice.

 

                   The
removal of a mens rea requirement from the offence described in s.
146(1) of the Code cannot be viewed under s. 1  of the Charter  as
a reasonable limit on the accused's s. 7  rights. Any rational connection
between absolute liability and the objective of deterrence is tenuous. An
absolute liability offence may serve as a deterrent to some but this effect, if
it exists, is greatly overstated. The impairment inherent in s. 146(1) , on the
other hand, is very substantial. The impugned offence allows for the conviction
of an individual who is not only morally innocent but who has taken all
reasonable steps to determine the age of his sexual partner. This is deeply
discordant with the principles of fundamental justice and may have a
deleterious impact on the justice system as a whole. A less offensive mechanism
was subsequently enacted by Parliament to serve the government's legitimate
objective. Finally, the potential benefits flowing from the retention of
absolute liability in s. 146(1)  are not in any way proportional to the degree
of impairment of the s. 7  right.

 

                   The
words ""whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or
more"" in s. 146(1)  are of no force and effect. Since the trial judge did
not allow the accused to make a defence based on the lack of mens rea,
the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was
delivered by

 

1.                       Le Dain J.‑‑I
would dismiss the appeal on the ground that s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  is not applicable to s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code 
because its application in this case would be a retrospective one. This Court
has recently affirmed, in dismissing the appeal from the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. James, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 669, that the Charter 
cannot be given retrospective application. In James, the Court of Appeal
held that s. 8  of the Charter  could not be applied to seizures carried
out before the Charter  came into force and that in consequence, s. 24  of
the Charter  could not, at the trial which took place after the Charter 
came into force, be applied to exclude evidence obtained from such seizures.
Tarnopolsky J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that
""one applies the law in force at the time when the act that is alleged to
be in contravention of a Charter  right or freedom occurs"" and that
""it is important that actions be determined by the law, including the
Constitution, in effect at the time of the action"": (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d)
1, at pp. 21 and 25.

 

2.                       The
""act"" or ""action"" that is alleged to infringe s. 7  of the Charter 
in this case is s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code , and in particular the
words ""whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or
more"" in that section. Because of those words s. 146(1) , which provides
for imprisonment, is said to constitute a deprivation of liberty not in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice, contrary to s. 7 . The issue of
retrospectivity in this appeal, as I perceive it, is how one characterizes the
effect of those words and when they must be deemed to have had their effect, in
so far as the application of s. 7  is concerned.

 

3.                       In
my respectful opinion the effect of the words ""whether or not he believes
that she is fourteen years of age or more"" in s. 146(1)  is to define, at
the time the offence is committed, one of the constituent elements of the
offence, the requisite mens rea, rather than to deny to the accused, at
the time of trial, a defence which he might otherwise have had. The so‑called
""defence"" of mistake of fact, which is removed by the above words,
serves to raise a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the requisite mens
rea. See Mahoney, ""The Presumption of Innocence: A New Era""
(1988), 67 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 5. Thus the removal of the
""defence"" of mistake of fact by the words ""whether or not he believes
that she is fourteen years of age or more"" in s. 146(1)  merely serves to
indicate that the offence, as defined, does not include that particular mental
state in its mens rea. The case of Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 350, is quite different. The ""act"" or ""action"" which
was alleged to have infringed the Charter  in that case was clearly one
that took place at the trial and after the Charter  had come into force:
the introduction at a new trial, contrary to s. 13  of the Charter , of
self‑incriminating evidence adduced at a previous trial.

 

4.                       The
criminal liability to imprisonment for the offence created by s. 146(1)  was
imposed by s. 146(1) , in respect of the offence committed by the appellant, at
the time the offence was committed. The liability imposed by law would
ordinarily be established at trial in a particular case in accordance with the
relevant substantive law, including any applicable constitutional provisions,
as it existed at the time the offence was committed. It would give a
retrospective application to s. 7  of the Charter  to apply it to s.
146(1) of the Code merely because the liability imposed by s. 146(1) 
continued after the Charter  came into force. It would be to change the
applicable substantive law with retrospective effect.

 

                   The
reasons of Lamer, Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. were delivered by

 

5.                       Wilson J.
(dissenting)‑‑The issue in this appeal is whether the statutory
denial of a defence of honest belief as to age in s. 146(1)  of the Criminal
Code  renders the section constitutionally invalid as an infringement of s.
7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  which is not saved by
s. 1 .

 

I The Facts

 

6.                       Between
December 31, 1981 and February 24, 1982 the accused had sexual intercourse five
times with a thirteen‑year‑old girl. The accused turned sixteen
years of age on January 14, 1982. All the acts of intercourse were consensual.

 

7.                       The
accused was charged with having sexual intercourse with a female person who was
at the time under the age of fourteen years and who was not his wife contrary
to s. 146(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. The
section at the time of the acts of sexual intercourse read as follows:

 

                   146.  (1) Every male person who
has sexual intercourse with a female person who

 

(a) is not his wife, and

 

(b) is under the age of fourteen years,

 

whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more,
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

II The Courts
Below

 

The Provincial Court

 

8.                       At
trial the accused moved to quash the information. He submitted that the
statutory denial of a defence based on mistake of fact concerning the girl's
age violated s. 7  of the Charter . In a brief oral judgment Davidson
Prov. Ct. J. dismissed the motion stating:

 

                   I'm reading this Section [s. 146(1)] which,
obviously, is directed at the protection of social interest, namely, the
protection of young children. Counsel argues that the maximum sentence here is
life imprisonment, but, of course, that is not a minimum penalty. It's
obviously a maximum penalty, and the judge, of course, in sentencing has the
ability to tailor his sentence in accordance with the facts of the case.

 

                   As I've indicated, I find that this Section is
directed at the protection of social interests and, under these circumstances,
I'm ruling that it doesn't offend Section 7  of the Charter of
Rights  . . . .

 

The accused then
entered a guilty plea. The trial judge convicted the accused and sentenced him
to a suspended sentence with two years probation.

 

The Court of Appeal

 

9.                       The
Court of Appeal (Martin, Houlden and Robins JJ.A.) dismissed the appeal in a
brief oral judgment: see (1983), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 198. The Court noted that the Criminal
Code  has contained a similar provision since it was first enacted in 1892.
The Court stated that similar legislation exists in the United States, England
and Australia, sometimes with a higher age limit than fourteen. Further, the
judges noted, the United States Supreme Court has ""never held that an
honest mistake as to the age of the prosecutrix is a constitutional defence to
statutory rape"". The Court of Appeal concluded as follows, at p. 200:

 

                   Assuming, without in any way deciding the question
that s. 7  of the Charter  permits judicial review of the substantive
content of legislation, we are all of the view that, in so far as this case is
concerned, s. 7  does not have the effect of invalidating s. 146(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and preventing Parliament from creating the crime of having sexual
intercourse with a girl under 14 years of age excluding mistake as to the age
of the girl as a defence therefrom.

 

It is to be noted that
the Court of Appeal's judgment pre‑dated the decision of this Court in Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.

 

III The Issue

 

10.                     The
appellant alleges that s. 146(1)  of the Criminal Code , by denying him a
defence based on mistake of fact as to the age of the female, violates his
rights under s. 7  of the Charter  and is accordingly unconstitutional.
This allegation requires us to answer the following questions:

 

(a) can the accused invoke the Charter  when his conduct
took place before the Charter  came into force?

 

(b) does s. 146(1)  infringe s. 7  of the Charter ? and

 

(c) to the extent that s. 146(1)  infringes s. 7 , is it saved by s.
1  of the Charter ?

 

(a) Retrospectivity

 

11.                     The
alleged criminal conduct by the accused took place shortly before the Charter 
came into force. The Charter  was in force, however, at the time of
the accused's trial. The respondent argues that the accused cannot rely on s. 7 
of the Charter  since this would involve giving s. 7  retrospective
effect. The accused responds by saying that since the issue is whether s. 7  of
the Charter  requires the accused to be afforded a mistake of fact
defence at his trial, the proper question to ask is whether the Charter  was
in force at the time of his trial. Since it was, the accused submits that this
case does not raise an issue of retrospectivity. This Court must decide which
of these two views is correct.

 

12.                     The
issue of the retrospective application of the Charter  has not yet been
examined in depth by this Court. A number of appellate courts have, however,
addressed the issue. In R. v. Thorburn (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 154
(B.C.C.A.), the British Columbia Court of Appeal was asked to rule on the
constitutional validity of this same section of the Criminal Code .
Unlike the present case Thorburn involved a challenge to the legislation
based on s. 15  of the Charter . The acts of intercourse took place before
s. 15  came into force. The trial, however, commenced two weeks after s. 15  came
into force. The sequence of events is therefore identical to that in the
present case‑‑the conduct with which the accused was charged pre‑dated
the coming into force of the section but his trial post‑dated it.

 

13.                     The
Crown in Thorburn argued that the accused in these circumstances could
not rely on the Charter . The Court of Appeal agreed. The Court relied
heavily on the decision of Borins J. in R. v. Dickson and Corman (1982),
3 C.C.C. (3d) 23, 145 D.L.R. (3d) 164, in which the learned judge stated, at
pp. 28‑32:

 

                   In my view, the proper question to ask relative to
the present application is whether it was the intention of Parliament in
enacting the Constitution Act, 1982 , that it apply to criminal conduct
engaged in and completed before the Constitution was proclaimed in force on
April 17, 1982. In this regard it is important to emphasize that I am concerned
only with criminal conduct and with criminal conduct engaged in and completed
before the Constitution became the law of Canada. It may well be that criminal
conduct engaged in prior to April 17, 1982, but continuing after that date will
bring about different considerations. The same may be said about other conduct
entered into before April 17, 1982, and continuing thereafter such as, for
example, discriminatory practices pursuant to legislation in place on the date
of proclamation of the Constitution and now alleged to be repugnant to it.

 

                   In approaching the question I find it rather
difficult to determine whether an affirmative answer would result in
characterizing the Constitution as retroactive or retrospective legislation, as
these words are defined by Driedger, ""Statutes: Retroactive Retrospective
Reflections"", 56 Can. Bar Rev. 264 (1978), and adopted by Doherty,
""`What's Done is Done': An Argument in Support of a Purely Prospective
Application of the Charter of Rights "", 26 C.R. (3d) 121 (1982). Indeed, it
may be that the Constitution defies strict doctrinal characterization as either
exclusively retroactive, retrospective or prospective legislation for, as I
suggested in the preceding paragraph, different facts may produce different
interpretations. The operation of the Constitution in different cases will no
doubt involve quite different considerations.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   With respect to the defendant's motion to quash
their indictment, it is my opinion that it must fail on the ground that the
Constitution has no application to criminal conduct engaged in and completed
before the Constitution was proclaimed in force. The Constitution cannot be
applied to support a declaration that the law pursuant to which an offence is
alleged to have been committed was inconsistent with the provisions of the
Constitution when the offence was completed before the Constitution was in
force.

 

14.                     A
similar conclusion was reached by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Lucas
(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 229 (Ont. C.A.) The material facts in Lucas
were identical to those in Thorburn. The Ontario Court of Appeal held
that the accused could not invoke the Charter . The following excerpts
from the decision, at pp. 236‑38, explain the Court's position:

 

                   As far as the cases before us are concerned I do not
think that it would be justifiable, in principle or policy, to hold that s. 15 
should be applicable to them. The basic argument in support of its
applicability is the simple one that if s. 15  is in force before the conclusion
of the proceedings and if its effect is that the provision under which the
respondents are being prosecuted is unconstitutional, then the respondents
should have the benefit of it even if this is, in effect, the application of
new substantive law to past events. While I appreciate that the consideration
of the superior nature of the Charter  could be called in aid of this approach,
it is an approach that could be applied, quite simply, in many cases involving
pre‑Charter  facts and it is reasonably clear that it has not been so
applied. I think that the decisions in applying, in the main, the traditional
principles relating to the possible retrospective application of statutes have
fairly resolved the issues in a manner that is probably consonant with the
intention of the framers of the Charter  and with considerations of even‑handed
justice.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   I think that to go this far would be an unwarranted
application of the Charter  to past events. There are often potential examples
of injustice on either side of the line when a new law comes into effect. It is
no more easy to do perfect justice in this area of the law than many others
but, by and large, the traditional rules relating to the prospective and
retrospective application of new law have arrived at a reasonable compromise of
the interests of justice ‑‑ including the important factor of
predictability.

 

                   In McDonald it was observed that it is
logical and fair that people should be dealt with in accordance with the law in
effect at the time of their acts (see pp. 340 and 349 C.C.C., pp. 755‑6
and 764‑5 O.R.). In this respect I have in mind those persons who committed
the same offence that the respondents are alleged to have committed at about
the same time but whose proceedings, for one reason or another, were completed
before s. 15  came into force. To give effect to the respondents' contentions on
this point would indicate that these people would be better off if, somehow or
other, the completion of their cases could have been delayed until April 17,
1985. In this respect the following passage in McDonald (at pp. 352‑3
C.C.C., p. 768 O.R.), albeit in that case it was concerned with whether the
phase‑in provision in the Young Offenders Act contravened s. 15 ,
is relevant:

 

                   Not only would this (the contention
of the respondent that unfinished adult court proceedings against 16 and 17‑year‑olds
should be transferred to a youth court on and after April 17, 1985) result in a
substantial and unplanned‑for increase in the youth court case‑load
and, in many cases, in legal confusion and substantially increased expenses (I
do not suggest that the latter in itself is a valid Charter  consideration), it
would also impinge upon the principle that we are concerned with in this
appeal, that of equality. Persons of the same age who committed offences during
the same period when a particular law was in force describing the consequences
relating to a conviction, would not be treated equally. The distinction,
depending on whether the proceedings were finally terminated before or after
April 17, 1985, would be an arbitrary and capricious one. It would turn the
administration of justice into a game and would ignore the important principle
of justice that equals should receive equal treatment. Also, if such were the
rule it would provide a strong incentive to indulge in improper tactics to
delay proceedings that would not be countenanced by a responsible legislator.

 

                   The respondent asks us to ignore
those persons in the same position as he is, except for the fact that their
cases were concluded before April 17, 1985, on the short ground that they are
not before the Court. Quite simply, a fair and sensible approach to the problem
before us, one that pays due regard to the integrity of the law, requires their
position to be taken into account.

 

I think that this consideration bears squarely on the fairness of the
application of the traditional rules to the retrospectivity issue in these
cases.

 

15.                     A
number of decisions of this Court have addressed the retrospective application
of the Charter  but none seem to me to be determinative of the issue in
the present appeal. In Irvine v. Canada (Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 181, this Court expressed the view in obiter
that the procedures to be followed at a hearing are to be determined by the law
as it existed at the time of the hearing. The issue arose because the rulings
of the Hearing Officer which were being challenged under the Charter  in
that case were all made before the Charter  came into force. Irvine,
however, did not settle the issue of whether an accused can invoke the Charter 
when the Charter  was not in force at the time of the accused's
conduct but was in force at the time of the accused's trial.

 

16.                     The
retrospective application of s. 15  was discussed by this Court in R. v.
Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713. Dickson C.J., writing for
the majority, stated, at p. 786:

 

                   No cogent argument was advanced in support of the
availability of s. 15  to challenge the conviction of the retailers in the
present case. Section 32(2) is clear:

 

                   32. ...

 

                   (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), section 15 
shall not have effect until three years after this section comes into force.

 

The retailers in the present appeals opened their stores, were charged
and were convicted at a time when the Charter  did not confer a right to equality
before and under the law. Even if it could be said that the Retail Business
Holidays Act has abridged the retailers' s. 15  rights since April 17, 1985,
I cannot see how this might have any bearing on the legality of their
convictions or of the Act prior to that time. The proceedings began and
continued through the courts as quasi‑criminal proceedings. This is not a
reference nor even a series of applications for declaratory relief.
Accordingly, no answer ought to be given to the second constitutional question
in respect of s. 15 .

 

It is apparent that Edwards
Books does not answer the question raised by the present appeal. It stands
for the proposition that one cannot rely on a right guaranteed by the Charter 
if the Charter  was not in force when one was tried and convicted. In
this appeal the Charter  was in force at the time of Stevens' trial.

 

17.                     In
R. v. James, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 669, the central issue was whether s. 8  of
the Charter  applied to conduct that took place prior to the coming into
force of the Charter . The Ontario Court of Appeal held that it did not:
see R. v. James (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 1. This Court, in a short oral
judgment, affirmed the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal.

 

18.                     Is
the James case determinative of the issue in the present appeal? It
seems to me that it is not. While this Court has affirmed in James that
conduct taking place prior to the coming into force of the Charter 
cannot constitute a violation of the Charter  so as to give rise to a
remedy under s. 24  of the Charter , the question whether s. 7  may be
invoked at a trial post‑Charter  in relation to pre‑Charter 
events is still an open question in this Court.

 

19.                     The
same may be said of the decision of this Court in Jack and Charlie v. The
Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 332. The accused in that case were Coast Salish
Indians charged with hunting deer out of season contrary to the Wildlife Act,
S.B.C. 1966, c. 55. They argued that the burning of raw deer meat was required
by their religion as part of a religious ceremony. They asserted their freedom
of religion under s. 2 (a) of the Charter . The Court held that the
accused could not invoke the Charter  because as Beetz J. writing for the
Court explained, at p. 338:

 

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had not been enacted
at the time the offence was committed.

 

It should be noted
that the trial also pre‑dated the coming into force of the Charter .
It was not open, therefore, to the accused in this case to allege a violation
of any trial‑related Charter  right.

 

20.                     In
Jack and Charlie the alleged infringement of the Charter 
consisted in the prohibition of conduct that the accused argued was protected
by freedom of religion in s. 2 (a) of the Charter . It made good
sense, therefore, to ask whether the conduct was constitutionally protected at
the time it took place. It clearly was not. In the present case, however, the
appellants allege a violation of s. 7 . Section 7  states:

 

                   7. Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

The structure of the
section, it seems to me, militates against having the protection of the right
hinge upon whether the Charter  was in force at the time of the accused's
conduct. Rather, the section seems to direct one to the point of time at which
someone is about to be deprived of his or her life, liberty or security of the
person. It is the projected deprivation which triggers the application of s. 7 .
We must ask therefore whether, at the time of the projected deprivation of the
accused's right to liberty, that deprivation would be in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice or not.

 

21.                     What
is it, we must ask, that makes the accused vulnerable to the loss of his
liberty in a way which does not accord with fundamental justice? Is it the
conduct which gave rise to the charge? Clearly not. There is nothing
fundamentally unjust in imprisoning a person convicted of having intercourse
with a female person who is under the age of fourteen and who is not his wife.
What is fundamentally unjust, the accused alleges, is to deny him the defence
of mistake of fact at his trial, to prevent him from adducing evidence to show
that he had no mens rea, no guilty mind, but bona fide believed
that the girl was over fourteen. It is the trial, he alleges, which does not
comport with the principles of fundamental justice by exposing him to
conviction and imprisonment on the basis of proof of the actus reus alone.
The Charter  was in full force and effect at the time of the trial. No
issue of retrospectivity is therefore raised.

 

22.                     The
accused finds some support for his position in this Court's judgment in Dubois
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350. The issue in Dubois was whether
evidence given by the accused in his previous trial could be used against him
in a new trial ordered by the court. The accused successfully argued that
allowing such evidence to be admitted would violate his right under s. 13  of
the Charter . The Crown, noting that the original trial had taken place
pre‑Charter , argued that the accused was attempting to have the Charter 
applied retrospectively. The Court unanimously rejected this argument,
concluding that an application of s. 13  of the Charter  may take pre‑Charter 
events into account without constituting a retrospective application of the Charter .
As Lamer J. stated for the majority, at p. 359:

 

                   In my view, s. 13  is not being given in this case a
retrospective effect. As I have indicated earlier, s. 13  guarantees the right
not to have a person's previous testimony used to incriminate him or her in
other proceedings. That right came into force on April 17, 1982, the date of
the coming into force of the Charter . However, given the nature and
purpose of the right, it inures to an individual at the moment an attempt is
made to utilize previous testimony to incriminate him or her. The time at which
the previous testimony was given is irrelevant for the purpose of determining
who may or may not claim the benefit of s. 13 . As of April 17, 1982, all
persons acquired the right not to have evidence previously given used to
incriminate them. The protection accorded by the right is related not to the
moment the testimony is given, but to the moment at which an attempt is made to
use that evidence in an incriminating fashion. [Emphasis added.]

 

23.                     Likewise,
in the present appeal, the protection accorded by s. 7  is not related to the
time of the accused's conduct, but to the time when he is denied the
opportunity to put forward his defence of honest mistake of fact. This is when
he becomes vulnerable to the loss of his liberty in a way which offends the principles
of fundamental justice. And this takes place at his trial post‑Charter .

 

24.                     It
does unquestionably follow from this conclusion, as the respondent points out,
that two people who engaged in the same conduct on the same day will have
different protection at their trials depending upon whether their trials occur
before or after the coming into force of s. 7 . One will be permitted to advance
the defence of honest mistake of fact and the other will not. It seems to me,
however, that this is mandated by the fact that the real impact of the impugned
words in s. 146(1)  is experienced for the first time at trial. It is at his
trial that an accused is confronted with the potential loss of his liberty in a
way which offends the principles of fundamental justice, i.e., by being
convicted of a criminal offence on the basis of proof of the actus reus
alone. In the pre‑Charter  era there was no constitutional
impediment to denying the accused a mistake of fact defence. But with the
advent of s. 7  of the Charter  such a denial became unconstitutional as a
violation of the principles of fundamental justice. An accused could not
thereafter be convicted and imprisoned under an unconstitutional provision. It
follows from this that there will inevitably be a disparity of treatment
between the two accused depending on their dates of trial. It does not,
however, seem to me to be an acceptable solution to such disparity to deprive
the accused whose trial post‑dates the Charter of his Charter  protection
in order to achieve the same result in each case.

 

25.                     In
determining whether retrospective effect should be given to new or amending
legislation a distinction is made at common law between matters of substance
and matters of procedure. It is necessary to review the common law in this
respect and decide whether or not it has any application to rights under the Charter .


 

26.                     The
general rule is stated in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes,
12th ed., at p. 215, as follows:

 

It is a fundamental rule of English law that no statute shall be
construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears
very clearly in the terms of the Act, or arises by necessary and distinct
implication.

 

However, it is not
always easy to determine whether the statute discloses an intent that it
operate retrospectively or gives rise to a necessary implication to that
effect. Craies on Statute Law, 7th ed., at p. 387, says that a statute
is retrospective if it:

 

...takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under existing law,
or creates a new obligation, or imposes a new duty, or attaches a new
disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past.

 

Other statutes,
although they may relate to acts or events which are past, are not
retrospective in the sense in which the word is used for purposes of the common
law rule. These statutes may be prospective in the sense that they operate
forwards although they look backwards. They attach new consequences for
the future to events that took place in the past before the statute
was enacted.

 

27.                     At
common law procedural statutes were traditionally treated as an exception to
the presumption against retrospective operation. Such statutes applied
retrospectively unless there was some special reason why they should not. In Maxwell,
supra, the rule is stated as follows, at p. 222:

 

                   The presumption against retrospective construction
has no application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice
of the courts. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure, but
only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time
being, by or for the court in which he sues, and if an Act of Parliament alters
that mode of procedure, he can only proceed according to the altered mode.
""Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless
there is some good reason or other why they should not be."" (Gardner v.
Lucas (1878) 3 App. Cas. 582, per Lord Blackburn at p. 603.)

 

28.                     Commenting
on the common law presumption against retrospective operation and its exception
in the case of procedural statutes, Professor William Black in ""Charter of
Rights ‑‑Application to Pre‑Enactment Events,"" [1982] U.B.C.
L.R. 59 (Charter Edition), states, at p. 65:

 

                   It is usually said that the presumption against
retrospective operation does not apply to procedural statutes and that such
statutes operate retrospectively unless there is some special reason why they
should not. On this basis, courts apply procedural rules after they are enacted
even though the proceedings concern an event that occurred before enactment. This
rule usually leads to a sound result, but it seems more sensible to base the
conclusion on the ground that the law is being applied prospectively and that
no special presumption is required. If a statute governs the way a hearing is
conducted or a decision is made, it seems best to classify it as retrospective
only if the hearing or decision occurs before the statute comes into effect.
It is hard to see why the date of the event giving rise to the litigation
should govern. For example, a statute that changes the onus of proof would be
classified as prospective if applied to a trial taking place after the statute
is enacted even though the trial is about a prior event. [Emphasis added.]

 

29.                     Professor
Côté agrees that the immediate application of procedural enactments is
improperly characterized as retrospective just because the enactments are being
applied to events that have already taken place. The application is immediate
or prospective: see Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada,
at p. 135 et seq. This would appear to be the more modern approach.

 

30.                     This
approach was followed by this Court in Regional Assessment Commissioner,
Region No. 13 v. Downtown Oshawa Property Owners' Association, [1978] 2
S.C.R. 1030. In that case a law was passed that altered the basis upon which
property values were to be assessed. The Supreme Court had to decide whether
the new law applied to proceedings that had already commenced before the new
law was passed. The Court concluded that it did, stating, at p. 1034:

 

The plain meaning of the words of s. 90 is that the criteria so set out
should apply to a series of bodies including the Ontario Municipal Board at the
time when each tribunal decides an assessment appeal. It is simply not a
question of retroactivity at all.

 

However, in other
comparable cases this Court has not viewed the operation of the provision as
prospective but has relied on the exception permitting retrospective operation
of procedural statutes in order to apply the provision: see especially Howard
Smith Paper Mills Ltd. v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 403.

 

31.                     Professor
Black concludes, at p. 66, of his article:

 

                   Whether a statute is treated as prospective or as an
exception to the presumption against retrospectivity, there is general
agreement as to the result; procedural statutes apply whether or not the events
at issue in the proceeding (the crime or tort, for example) occurred before the
statute was enacted.

 

32.                     Should
the interpretation of the Charter  be guided by these rules of statutory
construction? Or are there material differences between the Charter  and
ordinary legislation which makes them inappropriate? The most fundamental
difference is that while many statutes impose penalties, duties or disabilities
on citizens, the Charter  guarantees rights. Maxwell, supra,
points out, at p. 218, that the presumption against retrospective operation has
traditionally been applied in cases where retrospective operation ""would
prejudicially affect vested rights or the legality of past transactions, or
would impair contracts, or would impose new duties or attach new disabilities
in respect of past transactions"". These considerations do not apply where
a citizen is asserting a Charter  right.

 

33.                     Mr.
Elmer Driedger in his article ""The Meaning and Effect of the Canadian Bill
of Rights: A Draftsman's Viewpoint"" (1977), 9 Ottawa L.R. 303,
opined that the presumption against retrospective operation ought not to apply
to the Canadian Bill of Rights. He said, at p. 307:

 

There is a presumption against the retrospective operation of statutes;
but the prospective application of the Bill of Rights to a statute in existence
when the Bill became law is not a retrospective operation. There is also a
presumption against interference with vested rights; but the Bill of Rights
gives rights, rather than interferes with them.

 

The same is, of
course, true of the Charter .

 

34.                     However,
it seems to me that the decision as to whether Charter  provisions
operate retrospectively will no doubt mirror the common law. Just as at common
law procedural Acts are seen to apply to pre‑enactment conduct, the
procedural rights guaranteed by the Charter  would seem to apply to any
post‑Charter  proceeding regardless of when the underlying conduct
took place. These rights are proceeding‑oriented. They direct an
application to post‑Charter  proceedings: see Dubois v. The
Queen, supra. As Professor Black points out, it makes little
difference in the case of procedural provisions whether they are characterized
as prospective or as an exception to the presumption against retrospectivity.
The result is the same. Whether this is true of substantive rights guaranteed
by the Charter  will depend on whether these rights expressly direct or
necessarily imply that they apply to pre‑Charter  conduct. I do not
believe that a blanket rule can be adopted for all the provisions of the Charter .
Each section must be considered individually.

 

35.                     Section
7  admittedly presents difficulty in characterization for this purpose because
it enshrines both procedural and substantive rights. Can the same section
enshrine rights that apply to pre‑Charter  conduct and rights that
do not? I do not think it can. As discussed earlier, s. 7  rights crystallize at
the point at which the individual is about to be deprived of his or her life,
liberty or security of the person in a manner not consonant with fundamental
justice. This is true whether the rights are procedural or substantive. In the
present case, this deprivation occurred at the trial of the accused. Section 7 
was in force at that time. The accused was therefore entitled to rely on the
rights enshrined in the section.

 

36.                     In
any event, it would appear to me that the appellant is not really seeking a
retrospective application of the Charter . While the conduct giving rise
to the charge took place prior to the Charter 's coming into force, the
appellant is, in my view, asking that it be applied prospectively to determine
his rights at trial: see Professor Côté, supra. I find the following
quotation from the judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Antoine (1983), 5
C.C.C. (3d) 97, at pp. 102‑3, apposite in this case:

 

An enactment does not, however, operate retrospectively because a part
of the requisites for its operation is drawn from a time antecedent to its
coming into force, nor because it takes into account past events: see R. v.
Johnston (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 325, [1977] 2 W.W.R. 613, 37 C.R.N.S. 234;
affirmed [1978] 2 S.C.R. 391, 39 C.C.C. (2d) 479n, [1978] 2 W.W.R. 478
(S.C.C.); R. v. Negridge (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 6
M.V.R. 255 (Ont. C.A.).

 

I turn, therefore, to
the question whether s. 146(1) of the Code violates s. 7  of the Charter .

 

(b) Section 7 

 

37.                     Section
146(1) of the Code makes it an indictable offence punishable by a
maximum of life imprisonment for a male person to have sexual intercourse with
a female person who is under the age of fourteen and who is not his wife. It is
not a defence that the accused bona fide believed that the female person
was fourteen years of age or older. This defence is expressly removed by s.
146(1) . But for its statutory removal the defence would have been read in by
the courts: see R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, and Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120. However, since the statute expressly
removes it, the issue is whether the criminal offence can withstand substantive
judicial review under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

38.                     The
appellant's Charter  argument is simple and, in my view, convincing.
Section 146(1)  creates a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment. Such an offence, he submits, in order to survive a constitutional
challenge under s. 7 , must have a mens rea component. It cannot be an
absolute liability offence. It cannot permit the conviction and imprisonment of
a morally innocent person. He submits that this is exactly what it does. It
permits the conviction of an accused who honestly (but mistakenly) believed
that the complainant was fourteen years of age or older. This is so even if the
mistake was both honest and reasonable in the circumstances.

 

39.                     The
respondent, on the other hand, submits that s. 146(1)  does not create an
absolute liability offence. It contains a mens rea requirement. The
accused cannot be convicted of the offence unless he (a) intends to have sexual
intercourse, (b) intends to do so with a female, and (c) intends to do so with
someone who is not his wife. This position is somewhat disingenuous. It is
difficult to imagine how an accused could credibly plead that he was mistaken
as to the gender of his sexual partner or that he had mistakenly believed that
he was not having sexual intercourse when in fact he was. It is only slightly
more plausible that an accused could mistakenly believe that he was married to
the complainant when in fact he was not. On the whole it is difficult to
disagree with Professor Boyle's conclusion that "". . . in
practical terms, this is an offence of absolute liability"": see Boyle, Sexual
Assault, at p. 105.

 

40.                     Section
146(1) , accordingly, combines absolute liability with the possibility of
imprisonment. Earlier decisions of this Court make it clear that such an
arrangement violates s. 7  of the Charter . In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act, supra, Lamer J., writing for the majority, stated, at p. 513:

 

                   It has from time immemorial been part of our system
of laws that the innocent not be punished. This principle has long been
recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration of
justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human
person and on the rule of law. It is so old that its first enunciation was in
Latin actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.

 

Lamer J. went on to
quote from the judgment of Dickson J. (as he then was) writing for the Court in
R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, supra, where he stated that ""there
is a generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally innocent""
(p. 1310) and that absolute liability ""violates fundamental principles of
penal liability"" (p. 1311). Lamer J. further stated, at p. 515:

 

                   In my view it is because absolute liability offends
the principles of fundamental justice that this Court created presumptions
against legislatures having intended to enact offences of a regulatory nature
falling within that category. This is not to say, however, and to that extent I
am in agreement with the Court of Appeal, that, as a result, absolute liability
per se offends s. 7  of the Charter .

 

                   A law enacting an absolute liability offence will
violate s. 7  of the Charter  only if and to the extent that it has the
potential of depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person.

 

41.                     In
the recent decision of this Court in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
636, Lamer J., writing for the majority, found that s. 7  of the Charter 
had elevated the requirement of mens rea from a presumption of statutory
interpretation to a constitutionally mandated element of a criminal offence. He
expressed it this way, at p. 652:

 

In effect, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act acknowledges that, whenever
the state resorts to the restriction of liberty, such as imprisonment, to
assist in the enforcement of a law, even, as in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act,
a mere provincial regulatory offence, there is, as a principle of fundamental
justice, a minimum mental state which is an essential element of the offence.
It thus elevated mens rea from a presumed element in Sault Ste. Marie,
supra, to a constitutionally required element. Re B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act did not decide what level of mens rea was constitutionally
required for each type of offence, but inferentially decided that even for a
mere provincial regulatory offence at least negligence was required, in
that at least a defence of due diligence must always be open to
an accused who risks imprisonment upon conviction. [Emphasis in original.]

 

Section 7 , therefore,
prohibits the existence of offences that are punishable by imprisonment and
that do not allow the accused as a minimum a due diligence defence.

 

42.                     It
would appear then on the basis of these authorities that s. 146(1)  is
vulnerable to attack under s. 7  of the Charter  in that it attaches
criminal liability on pain of imprisonment to conduct that is not only lacking
in mens rea but is also non‑negligent. An accused can be convicted
under the section even although he can show that he made an honest and
reasonable mistake about the victim's age. This is not in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice. The section is, therefore, in violation of
s. 7 . Can it be saved as a reasonable limit under s. 1 ?

 

(c) Section 1 

 

43.                     The
judgment of this Court in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act was applied by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Ferguson, [1987] 6 W.W.R. 481.
That case raised the same issue as the present appeal, namely the constitutional
validity of s. 146(1) of the Code under s. 7  of the Charter . Both
the majority (McLachlin J.A. with Taggart J.A. concurring) and the minority (An‑
derson J.A.) held, on the authority of Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, that
the section infringed s. 7  of the Charter . The majority, however, found
that it was saved by s. 1 . Anderson J.A. found that it was not. The decision is
accordingly highly instructive on the s. 1  analysis.

 

44.                     McLachlin
J.A., after adverting to the principles enunciated by Dickson C.J. in R. v.
Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, addressed the government objectives intended to
be achieved by s. 146(1) . She said, at p. 517:

 

                   The offence of sexual intercourse with a female
child has been justified by different values at different times. The modern
view is that the offence must be retained in the interests primarily of
protecting children and secondarily of protecting society from the impact of
the social problems which sexual intercourse with children may produce.

 

                   The protection of children is multi‑faceted
and so obvious that evidence is not required to demonstrate it. First, there is
an interest in protecting young girls from the consequences of pregnancies
which they may be ill‑equipped to deal with from a physical, emotional or
economic point of view. Second, there is an interest in protecting such
children from the grave physical and emotional harm which may result from
sexual intercourse at such an early age. Finally, there is an interest in
protecting them from exploitation by those who might seek to use them for
prostitution and related nefarious purposes.

 

She was persuaded that
these objectives were of sufficient importance to warrant overriding the s. 7 
right provided the means chosen to do so were appropriate.

 

45.                     McLachlin
J.A. had no difficulty in finding a rational connection between the impugned
limit and the government objectives although this was hotly debated in the case
and formed the basis on which Anderson J.A. dissented. She stated, at
p. 520:

 

                   The appellant submits that the elimination from s.
146(1) of the defence of mistaken belief as to the age of the complainant is
not rationally connected to the section's objectives. He argues that a man who
believes that a girl is above the limited age will not be deterred by the
absolute character of the offence. It follows, he submits, that there is no
rational justification for refusing to permit the accused to raise his innocent
belief in his defence.

 

                   In my opinion, this argument rests on a fallacy. The
fallacy lies in the proposition that a man who believes that a girl is above
the limited age will not be deterred by knowledge that his belief as to her age
affords no defence. This, in my opinion, is not necessarily the case. A person
who believes a certain thing must also accept that he may be mistaken in that
belief. Belief and recognition that the belief may be in error are not mutually
incompatible. Thus a man might conclude that a girl is over 14 because she
looks older than 14. At the same time he might be aware that some girls who
clearly appear to be over 14 are in fact younger than 14. This man would not be
deterred from having sexual relations with the girl if he knew that his belief
as to her age was a defence. However, he might well be deterred if he knew that
regardless of his belief, he would be convicted if the girl turned out to be
under 14. This truth is recognized by Glanville Williams, in Criminal Law, 2nd
ed. (1961), p. 241:

 

If in the future some person who is inclined to such conduct knows the
law as it is now held to be, he may say to himself: ""I believe the girl to
be over sixteen; but nothing in life is certain, and if she is in fact, under
sixteen I may be punished: it is not worth the risk."" To this extent
absolute prohibition may deter.

 

It is worth noting
that immediately after this passage Professor Glanville Williams continues:
""But...to maintain the prohibition involves punishing the unlucky ones who
turn out to be wrong, while letting free those who happen to be right, and this
offends the sense of justice"". McLachlin J.A. concluded that ""logic
and common sense dictate that elimination of mens rea as to the complainant's
age provides an additional deterrent to those contemplating intercourse with
young females"" (p. 521).

 

46.                     McLachlin
J.A. also found that the impugned limit impaired the s. 7  right no more than
was required to achieve the government objective. She stated, at pp. 523‑24:

 

                   The only serious alternative to the elimination from
s. 146(1) of the defence of the accused's belief as to the complainant's age is
the proposal put forward by the Law Reform Commission of a reverse onus coupled
with a due diligence test. This alternative has been embodied in s. 139(4) of Bill
C‑15, which was adopted by Parliament (after the hearing of this appeal),
received Royal Assent on 30th June 1987, but has not been proclaimed. That
provision states that it is not a defence to the charge ""that the accused
believed that the complainant was fourteen years of age or more at the time the
offence is alleged to have been committed unless the accused took all
reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the complainant"".

 

                   This provision is not without its problems. What
constitutes ""all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the
complainant""? If the child has no proof of identification, would a simple
inquiry suffice? If not, would requesting and obtaining proof of age in the
form of a birth certificate or driver's licence suffice? Street children and
those exploiting them may be expected to forge, borrow or steal appropriate
documentation. Where then is found the protection of children and the
deterrence of those who exploit them?

 

                   When s. 146(1) is compared with the alternative of
the defence of having taken ""all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of
the complainant"", it is far from clear that it is an unreasonable approach
to attaining the desired objective of the protection of children and society.
Section 146(1) provides a considerably stronger deterrent than the alternative
embodied in Bill C‑15. Given the importance of the goal of protecting
children against the evils of immature intercourse, it can be argued that that
[sic] the need for the additional deterrent effect of s. 146(1)
outweighs the need to permit accused persons to raise the defence of innocent
belief. In short, the proposed alternative to s. 146(1) is problematic and
calculated to reduce the protection which the law affords to children. On the
test proposed by the majority of the Supreme Court in R. v. Edwards Books,
the limited infringement of the rights of some accused persons entailed by s.
146(1) infringes on the accused's rights as little as ""reasonably possible"".

 

47.                     In
addressing the issue of the proportionality of the means used to the objective
sought to be achieved McLachlin J.A. acknowledged that the infringement of s. 7 
by s. 146(1) was a serious one. That being so, it could only be saved under s.
1  if the objective to which it was directed was ""of considerable
importance"". She found that it was. I quote from pp. 525‑26:

 

                   I have earlier in these reasons discussed the
magnitude of the personal and social problems which result from men having
intercourse with girls who, while physically mature, remain children. The evils
of premature pregnancy, lasting physical and psychological harm to children,
and the exploitation of children through prostitution and wantonness are serious
and widely accepted. The question is whether they are serious enough to justify
the significant infringement of the accused's constitutional right not to be
imprisoned without proof that he intended to commit the prohibited act. In
short, is the necessary proportionality or balance established?

 

                   In my view, it is. Elimination from s. 146(1) of the
defence of the accused's belief that the complainant is over the statutory age
provides additional protection to a class of children who would otherwise have
little protection‑‑girls under the age of 14 who appear to be older‑‑the
very class of children at greatest risk from the evils of pregnancy and
prostitution. It means that men cannot engage in sexual intercourse with girls
who appear to have attained the statutory age or who otherwise convince them
they have attained that age, secure that their belief will afford them a
defence should they be charged. They will know that regardless of what the girl
may say or how she may appear, there is a possibility that conviction may
ensue. In the absence of any alternative providing equivalent protection, it
cannot be said that elimination of the accused's belief that the child was over
14 as a defence under s. 146(1) is a disproportionate or unreasonable response
to the problem.

 

She concluded that not
only was the limit reasonable, it was also justified in a free and democratic
society. She stated, at p. 527:

 

For over a century these statutes have been an integral feature of the
legal system in these countries. This state of affairs is a convincing
indication that the limitation on the rights of the accused entailed in
eliminating mens rea as to the age of the victim in the offence of intercourse
with a female child is justifiable in a free and democratic society.

 

48.                     Is
McLachlin J.A. correct in suggesting that absolute liability is rationally
connected to the objective of deterrence? In my view, if there is a connection,
it is a somewhat tenuous one. The learned Justice's thesis seems to be based on
the assumption that an individual contemplating sexual intercourse with a
female who appears to him to be over 14 first addresses his mind to the mens
rea requirement of a fairly obscure section of the Code. In my view,
this ascribes an unrealistically high degree of legal sophistication to the
average accused.

 

49.                     Moreover,
it seems to me that any general deterrence that could conceivably flow from the
statutory negation of the mens rea requirement would only afford protection
to a narrow subset of the protected group. As Professor Boyle points out, the
lack of a mistake of fact defence ""is irrelevant with respect to the most
serious form of the offence, intercourse with very young children, where one
can suppose that a mistake of fact argument would not work anyway"" (pp.
107‑8). Any hypothetical deterrence, therefore, will be limited to
borderline cases. As McLachlin J.A. points out, the deterrent effect of the
rule cannot be documented. It is, however, necessary to attempt to quantify
this effect in order to assess whether the respondent has discharged its s. 1 
onus. While the fact that s. 146(1) is an absolute liability offence may serve
as a deterrent to some who would not otherwise be deterred, I cannot think that
the deterrent effect is as great as McLachlin J.A. perceives it to be.

 

50.                     Assuming
that a rational connection can be established, can s. 146(1) be said to impair
the s. 7  right as little as possible? The impairment inherent in s. 146(1) is
very substantial. The impugned offence allows for the conviction of an
individual who is not only morally innocent but who has taken all reasonable
steps to determine the age of his sexual partner. This is deeply discordant
with the principles of fundamental justice. Furthermore, it may have a
deleterious impact on the justice system as a whole. As Dickson J. stated in R.
v. Sault Ste. Marie, at p. 1311:

 

                   Arguments of greater force are advanced against
absolute liability. The most telling is that it violates fundamental principles
of penal liability. It also rests upon assumptions which have not been, and
cannot be, empirically established. There is no evidence that a higher standard
of care results from absolute liability. If a person is already taking every
reasonable precautionary measure, is he likely to take additional measures,
knowing that however much care he takes, it will not serve as a defence in the
event of breach? If he has exercised care and skill, will conviction have a
deterrent effect upon him or others? Will the injustice of conviction lead to
cynicism and disrespect for the law, on his part and on the part of others?
These are among the questions asked.

 

51.                     Is
a less offensive mechanism not available to serve the government's legitimate
objective? Parliament seems to have concluded that the answer to this question
is yes. The provisions recently enacted [S.C. 1987, c. 24] to replace s. 146(1)
allow the accused to raise a defence of due diligence. Sections 140 and 141 of
the Code replace the old s. 146(1) by creating the new substantive
offences of sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching. Both of
these provisions apply to sexual conduct with a person under the age of
fourteen.  under these new sections stating:

 

                   139. ...

 

                   (4) It is not a defence to a charge under
section 140 or 141, subsection 155(3) or 169(2), or section 246.1, 246.2 or
246.3 that the accused believed that the complainant was fourteen years of age
or more at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed unless the
accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the complainant.

 

There can be no doubt
that this provision infringes the accused's s. 7  rights less than the section
challenged in the present appeal. Parliament has therefore concluded that
society's needs can be served by a less stringent provision. Given that the
respondent has changed its legislation in this way, I do not think it is open
to the respondent to argue that the impugned version of s. 146(1) impaired the
accused's rights as little as possible. This is not a case where the court is
forced to speculate about the possibility of less offensive legislative
schemes. Parliament has already enacted one.

 

52.                     Finally,
it cannot, in my opinion, be said that the potential benefits flowing from the
retention of absolute liability in s. 146(1) are in any way proportional to the
degree of impairment of the s. 7  right. I agree with Anderson J.A. who made the
following observation in his dissenting reasons, at p. 509:

 

Even if one assumes that the retention of strict liability in s. 146(1)
would have some limited deterrent effect and some rational connection to the
objective of protecting young girls, which is highly doubtful, I am of the
opinion that the removal of the defence of honest mistake of age does not
satisfy the other two components of the proportionality test. The denial of the
defence of honest belief as to age in s. 146(1) dramatically impairs the right
of the accused not to be convicted of crime if he honestly, although
mistakenly, believes in circumstances which would render his conduct innocent.

 

                   Furthermore, in my opinion, the deterrent effect of
the denial of the defence of mistake of fact in s. 146(1) would be so marginal
as not to justify the punishment of innocent persons or the placing of
restraints on proper and legal activities. While theoretically one may
speculate that the strict liability offence in s. 146(1) may have some
deterrent effect, there is little to suggest that the effect is significant.

 

53.                     I
would, accordingly, conclude that the removal of a mens rea component
from the offence described in s. 146(1) of the Code cannot be viewed
under s. 1  of the Charter  as a reasonable limit on the accused's s. 7 
rights.

 

IV The Remedy

 

54.                     Section
52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982  provides as follows:

 

                   52. (1) The Constitution of Canada
is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the
provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no
force or effect.

 

55.                     Counsel
for the appellant seeks a declaration that s. 146(1) of the Code is
constitutionally invalid and that his client should therefore be acquitted.
With respect, it seems to me that s. 52(1)  is very specific that a law found to
be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is only without force
and effect to the extent of the inconsistency. I believe therefore that
the appropriate declaration under s. 52(1)  is to the effect that the words in
s. 146(1) ""whether or not he believes that she is fourteen years of age or
more"" are of no force and effect. This means that the section shorn of the
offensive words will read:

 

                   146. (1) Every
male person who has sexual intercourse with a female person who

 

(a) is not his wife, and

 

(b) is under the age of fourteen years,

 

is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
life.

 

56.                     At
trial the appellant attempted to enter a defence based on lack of mens rea.
The trial judge did not allow him to make this defence, holding that the
express denial of this defence in s. 146(1) of the Code was
constitutionally valid. The trial judge was wrong. The appellant should have
been allowed to make his defence.

 

57.                     This
being so, the appellant's conviction must be quashed and a new trial ordered.
The new trial would take place under the section as amended above. Given,
however, the circumstances of this case, the length of time which has elapsed
since the conduct giving rise to the charge, and the fact that the appellant
has already served his two years of probation, this might well be an
appropriate case for the Attorney General to direct a stay of proceedings under
s. 508 of the Code.

 

58.                     I
would allow the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Procedure ‑‑ Autrefois acquit ‑‑
Information failing to allege material averment ‑‑ Defective counts
quashed ‑‑ New information sworn containing necessary words ‑‑
Whether or not plea of autrefois acquit available ‑‑ Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 529(1), (3), (4), 535(1), (3), (4), (5),
537(1).

 

                   Respondent
was charged with eight counts of theft and possession of stolen property. The
possession charges were laid under s. 312(1)  of the Criminal Code . The
information on two counts lacked the averment of an essential element of the
offence. Respondent entered pleas of not guilty to the charges against him and
elected to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury. The trial judge
and counsel agreed that it was not possible to strike the pleas and that, since
two of the counts simply failed to allege an offence rather than alleging an
offence improperly, it was not possible to amend them at all.

 

                   A
new information containing the necessary words omitted from the earlier
information was subsequently sworn. Respondent's pleas of autrefois acquit
were refused by the second trial judge who convicted on one of the counts. The
Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal from conviction.

 

                   The
issue here is whether quashing an information, after plea, for failure to
allege a material averment constitutes a verdict of acquittal for the purpose
of pleading autrefois acquit to a new information.

 

 

                   Held (Dickson C.J. and
Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

                   Per McIntyre, Lamer,
Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: Section 529 grants very wide powers to the trial
judge, subject to certain limits, to cure any defect in a charge by amending
it. The judge can only quash if the required amendment cannot be made without
injustice being done and it is a reversible error of law if a judge does so
without coming to that conclusion. If an amendment, as a matter of law, cannot
be made without causing irreparable prejudice, the quashing of the charge at
the trial is tantamount to an acquittal. Relaying an amended charge before
another judge would be no less prejudicial to the accused than the previous
judge's amending the first one. Sections 529(4) and (5) would then be a useless
exercise of judgment.

 

                   The
judge should not have quashed here for an amendment would not have prejudiced
the accused. The Crown, however, cannot lay an amended charge once the accused
has been acquitted, albeit by error. The trial judge's decision is open to
appeal. The Court of Appeal, assuming error is found, will direct the trial
judge to amend and hear the case, or will amend the charge itself and return
the matter for trial on the amended charge. The fact that the accused will be
tried on the amended charge is no reason for downgrading the
""quashing"" so as to permit the Crown to relay an amended charge
without facing a special plea. When a judge quashes under s. 529, that decision
is deemed without error until reversed by a Court of Appeal.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Wilson and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ. (dissenting): A defective information is
not automatically a nullity disclosing no offence known to law. If the document
gives fair notice of the offence to the accused, it can be amended under the
broad powers of amendment s. 529 gives to the courts. Only if a charge is so
badly drawn up as to fail even to give the accused notice of the charge will it
fail the minimum test required by s. 510(2)(c). A charge that is this
defective would have to be quashed. A conviction is possible, however, on a
defective information: defects in form do not defeat what is valid in
substance.

 

                   The
first information was clearly not a nullity. The accused knew the charges he
faced and was not prejudiced by the missing averment. Further, all the elements
of the offence would have been proven by the Crown. Respondent, therefore, was
in jeopardy which is the first requirement for a successful plea of autrefois
acquit.

 

                   A
disposition in the nature of a final determination is an essential element of a
plea of autrefois acquit. Section 537 should not be read as an exception
to this requirement when the possibility of an amendment is raised. Section 537
is a guide to the relationship between the amending powers and the requirement
of identity and is to be used to decide whether or not charges are identical.

 

                   Whether
or not a judicial determination that ends proceedings will support a plea of autrefois
acquit depends on the nature of the legal basis for the decision. Decisions
based on substantive legal principles will generally support a plea of autrefois
acquit. Decisions based on procedure are more complex. Some decisions may
end defective proceedings without barring the Crown from starting anew; other
decisions may amount to a final determination that can be appealed but cannot
be replaced by new proceedings. A formula precisely covering all possible situations
is virtually impossible. Three of those factors important to the decision,
however, are the nature of the defect involved, the stage in the proceedings at
which it is raised, and the degree of prejudice to the accused.

 

                   The
availability of autrefois acquit depends on the nature of the legal
decision made at the earlier trial. The common law rule has always been that
subsequent proceedings are not precluded by the quashing of a defective charge.
While the analysis leading to that same result must now take into account the
more flexible modern policy regarding technical defects, amendments, and
appeals, the justice of the result reached has not changed.

 

                   The
defect in the information in this case was of a technical nature. Although it
related to the elements of the offence charged, the reason for the quashing in
no way was an adjudication on the legal or factual issues raised by the
information. The technical error was caught at a very early stage in the trial,
before the Crown had even led evidence. While it may be the case that technical
errors in an information can sometimes prejudice the accused so that a quashing
amounts to an acquittal, it is not the case here. The decision, while on a
point of law, was not a final decision. As a result, autrefois acquit
was not available to the accused.

Facts

 

2.                       The
appellant, Barry Graham Moore, and two other people, not parties to this
appeal, were charged in an eight‑count information with various counts of
theft and possession of stolen property. The possession charges were laid under
s. 312(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, which reads:

 

                   312. (1) Every one commits
an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of
any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or of
the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from

 

(a) the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by
indictment; . . .

 

3.                       Count
6 of the information, the count with which we are in this appeal particularly
concerned, reads:

 

count  6 The
informant also says that he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and
does believe that Barry Graham MOORE, on or about the 27th day of February
A.D., 1981, at or near the Town of Williams Lake, County of Cariboo and
Province of British Columbia, did UNLAWFULLY have in his possession, automobile
parts, the property of Zora Enterprises Ltd. of a value exceeding two hundred
dollars,

 

CONTRARY TO THE FORM OF STATUTE IN SUCH CASE MADE AND PROVIDED

 

4.                       It
will be noted that the information lacks the averment of an essential element
of the offence, namely that Moore knew that the property had been obtained from
the commission in Canada of an indictable offence. Moore entered a plea of not
guilty to the charges against him and elected to be tried by a magistrate
without a jury.

 

5.                       When
the matter came on for trial, the trial judge, Smith Prov. Ct. J., asked
defence counsel if he had any submission to make. The judge also asked Crown
counsel if he had any comments on the information. Counsel made no comment. The
judge then pointed out the defect and asked defence counsel if he had a motion
to quash under s. 529  of the Criminal Code . Defence counsel promptly
argued that the counts disclosed no offence known to law. The trial judge and
Crown counsel agreed with that submission. Defence counsel moved that the
defective counts be quashed. Crown counsel moved that the pleas be struck to
permit the Crown to amend the information pursuant to s. 529 . The trial judge
asked if it was possible to strike the pleas, and Crown counsel agreed that the
court could not. Defence counsel then argued that since the counts simply
failed to allege an offence, rather than alleging one improperly, it was not
possible to amend them at all. Again the judge and Crown counsel agreed with
this statement and the judge quashed the defective counts.

 

6.                       A
new information containing the necessary words omitted from the earlier
information was subsequently sworn. When trial on that information began, Moore
entered pleas of autrefois acquit on the possession counts. The second
trial judge, Barnett Prov. Ct. J., refused the special pleas because he
accepted the Crown's submission that the counts in the first information had
been ""hopelessly bad"". He ruled that since there had never been any allegation
of criminal misconduct, the appellant had never been in peril of conviction.
The first essential for a special plea of autrefois acquit was not
present and the plea was not available. Moore then entered pleas of not guilty
to the two charges. He was convicted on count  6. An appeal was taken to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

                                                                    II

 

The British Columbia
Court of Appeal

 

7.                       Anderson
J.A. held that the trial judge erred in law in quashing the defective counts,
since he could have amended them. The unamended counts were not nullities. He
held that the accused had been in jeopardy and the major question on the appeal
was whether there was a final disposition of the charges. Anderson J.A. was of
the view that the quashing of the charges was a dismissal of the charges from
which the Crown had a right of appeal. Even if that decision was erroneous, it
disposed of the charges before the court unless corrected on appeal. Anderson
J.A. held that the case could not be distinguished from R. v. Riddle,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 380, and Petersen v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 493, and
that it would not be proper to try to draw any distinction based on technical
or procedural classifications. Anderson J.A. therefore allowed the appeal,
Lambert J.A. concurring.

 

8.                       Craig
J.A. in dissent agreed with Anderson J.A. that the trial judge erred by not
amending the information, since there was no prejudice to the accused. He also
agreed that the accused was in jeopardy and that the plea of autrefois
acquit would be available if there had been a final disposition of the
charges. He held that s. 537(1)(b) has not altered the requirement of a
final disposition in cases where an amendment was available. Craig J.A.
disagreed with Anderson J.A. on the effects of quashing the information.
Relying on R. v. Sheets, [1971] S.C.R. 614, and R. v. Beason
(1983), 36 C.R. (3d) 73 (Ont. C.A.), he held that quashing an information for
procedural or technical defects did not amount to a disposition equivalent to
an acquittal. Since the sole reason for quashing in this case was the technical
failure to allege an essential element of the offence, Craig J.A. would have
held that autrefois acquit was not available and would have dismissed
the appeal.

Legislation

 

9.                       For
a greater understanding of the issue in this appeal, it may be helpful to set
out the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code :

 

                   535. (1) An accused
may plead the special pleas of

 

(a) autrefois acquit,

 

(b) autrefois convict, and

 

(c) pardon.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (3) The pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois
convict and pardon shall be disposed of by the judge without a jury before
the accused is called upon to plead further.

 

                   (4) When the pleas referred to in subsection (3) are
disposed of against the accused, he may plead guilty or not guilty.

 

                   (5) Where an accused pleads autrefois acquit
or autrefois convict it is sufficient if he

 

(a) states that he has been lawfully acquitted or convicted, as
the case may be, of the offence charged in the count to which the plea relates,
and

 

(b) indicates the time and place of the acquittal or conviction.

 

                   537. (1) Where an issue on
a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict to a count is
tried and it appears

 

(a) that the matter on which the accused was given in charge on
the former trial is the same in whole or in part as that on which it is
proposed to give him in charge, and

 

(b) that on the former trial, if all proper amendments had been
made that might then have been made, he might have been convicted of all the
offences of which he may be convicted on the count to which the plea of
autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is pleaded,

 

the judge shall give judgment discharging the accused in respect of
that count.

 

                   529. (1) An objection
to an indictment or to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent on the
face thereof shall be taken by motion to quash the indictment or count before
the accused has pleaded, and thereafter only by leave of the court or judge
before whom the trial takes place, and a court or judge before whom an
objection is taken under this section may, if it is considered necessary, order
the indictment or count to be amended to cure the defect.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (3) A court shall, upon the arraignment of an
accused, or at any stage of the trial, amend the indictment or a count thereof
as may be necessary where it appears

 

(a) that the indictment has been preferred

 

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of Canada instead of this Act,
or

 

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act of the Parliament of Canada;

 

(b) that the indictment or a count thereof

 

(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to
constitute the offence,

 

(ii) does not negative an exception that should be negatived,

 

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

 

and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed
by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or

 

(c) that the indictment or a count thereof is in any way
defective in form.

 

                   (4) The court shall, in considering whether or not
an amendment should be made, consider

 

(a) the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry,

 

(b) the evidence taken on the trial, if any,

 

(c) the circumstances of the case,

 

(d) whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his
defence by a variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3),
and

 

(e) whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the
proposed amendment can be made without injustice being done.

 

                                                                   IV

Jeopardy

 

10.                     The
first question in this appeal is whether Moore was in jeopardy at the first
hearing. If not, autrefois acquit was not available at the second
hearing and he would have been properly convicted. This was the position of the
second trial judge. The judge stated that the first information was a nullity
disclosing no charge known to law; since Moore could not have been convicted on
that information, he was never in jeopardy and could not plead autrefois
acquit. This decision is consistent with the traditional common law
approach to defective indictments. At common law, a trial judge had no power to
amend even a trifling error in the indictment without the agreement of the
grand jury that presented it. This inability coupled with extremely technical
pleadings meant that a defective indictment was a nullity that did not bar
subsequent proceedings; otherwise, criminal charges would sometimes be
determined solely by procedural questions. (Friedland, Double Jeopardy,
at p. 65.)

 

11.                     There
is a great deal to be said for the common law rule that a disposition on a
technical defect in the charge will not bar subsequent proceedings. However,
that result can no longer be justified on the basis that the accused was never
in jeopardy. Two relatively recent judgments of this Court, R. v. Major,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 826, and R. v. Côté, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, demonstrate that
the modern approach to technical defects is more flexible. At issue in both
cases was the validity of a conviction based on a defective information. The
Court upheld both convictions.

 

12.                     In
R. v. Major, the accused was involved in a traffic accident and was
charged with failure to report his licence number and vehicle registration to
someone at the scene, as required by the Nova Scotia Motor Vehicle Act.
The charge stated only that the accused had not informed the other driver. The
Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, held that a proper statement of the
offence required an allegation of a failure to report to the other driver, to a
passenger in the other car, or to a witness (R. v. Major (1975), 10
N.S.R. (2d) 348). Since the information failed to mention the last two
elements, it was seriously defective and did not disclose an offence known to
law. The Appeal Division then went on to consider whether a conviction on a
defective information could be upheld and concluded that it could, based on s.
510  of the Criminal Code . That provision provides that so long as a
charge contains in substance an allegation that an offence has been committed,
it is not a nullity. Provided that the accused has not been misled by the
error, even the omission of an essential averment can be cured. The defective
charge is voidable but amendable under ss. 529  or 732 . There is one other
factor: the omission of an essential averment does not free the Crown of its
obligation to prove all the elements of an offence. For an appeal court to
uphold a conviction, the Crown must have led some evidence at trial to prove
all the elements of the offence. In other words, if the Crown proves the
substance of the offence it does not matter that the process was defective,
provided the accused was not misled or prejudiced by the defect.

 

13.                     On
the facts in Major, however, the majority of the Appeal Division held
that the Crown had not led evidence to prove all the elements of the offence.
Cooper J.A. dissented on that point and would have held that there was evidence
to show the accused had not reported the accident to anyone. On appeal, this
Court, in a short oral judgment, adopted the reasons of Cooper J.A. and affirmed
the conviction.

 

14.                     This
Court examined the same issue in greater depth in Côté. In that case,
the accused was charged with refusal to give a breath sample, but the
information did not allege ""without reasonable excuse"". Nevertheless,
the accused advanced a defence of reasonable excuse at trial, at trial de
novo, and on appeal, without any challenge to the information. The
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal raised the issue of the defective information ex
proprio motu and quashed the information. This Court allowed the appeal and
restored the conviction.

 

15.                     Justice
de Grandpré for the majority held there was no defect, since the information
referred to the correct section number. That, together with the facts set out
in the information, gave the accused full notice of the offence charged. de
Grandpré J. went on to consider Major and decided that it applied. He
interpreted Major to say that if the defect caused no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice, and if the Crown had actually proved all the
elements of the offence, then the conviction should be affirmed. Although s.
732 could have been used to amend the information, the conviction could be
upheld on appeal without an amendment. Justice Spence for the minority,
concurring in the result, held that the information was not defective because
it referred to the Code section.

 

16.                     The
result of these two cases is that it is no longer possible to say that a
defective information is automatically a nullity disclosing no offence known to
law. If the document gives fair notice of the offence to the accused, it is not
a nullity and can be amended under the broad powers of amendment s. 529  gives
to the courts. Only if a charge is so badly drawn up as to fail even to give
the accused notice of the charge will it fail the minimum test required by s.
510(2)(c). A charge that is this defective would have to be quashed. R.
v. Hunt, Nadeau, and Paquette (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 382 (B.C.C.A.)
provides an example of a defective charge of this sort. The accused was
apparently charged with intimidation by blocking a highway, but it was not
clear from the information who was alleged to have blocked the highway nor did
the charge refer to a Code section. The Court of Appeal held that the
charge was so defective it could not be amended.

 

17.                     Major
and Côté also establish that a conviction is possible on a defective
information and that the conviction will be upheld on appeal. Both sides can
point out defects in process to the trial judge. If there is no motion to quash
or to amend and a defence is tendered, there is no need to amend the
information (Côté, at p. 15). So long as the defect does not prejudice
the accused and the Crown actually proves all the elements of the offence, a
conviction will be valid. Defects in form do not defeat what is valid in
substance.

 

18.                     The
Court took a similar approach to amendments for variance under s. 529(2) in Morozuk
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 31. The accused was charged with unlawful
possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, particularized as cannabis
marihuana. The evidence showed that the accused possessed cannabis resin.
Justice Lamer for the Court held that the Crown had proved the possession of a
narcotic and that the accused was properly convicted. The Court amended the
indictment under s. 613(1)(b)(i) and (3) to read cannabis resin and
dismissed the appeal.

 

19.                     The
British Columbia Court of Appeal applied Major and Côté in two
cases, R. v. Stewart (1979), 7 C.R. (3d) 165 and Re Regina and Henyu
(1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 471. Henyu held that defective informations are
not nullities and can be amended at trial (at pp. 474‑75). Stewart
held that if the defect is not noticed at trial, the conviction will be upheld
if there is no prejudice, injustice, or substantial wrong to the accused (at
p. 174).

 

20.                     In
the case at bar, the first information was clearly not a nullity. The accused
knew that he faced a charge of possession of stolen goods. Neither Crown nor
defence counsel even noticed the missing averment until the judge pointed it
out. It is difficult to argue the accused was prejudiced by the missing
averment. It is also fairly clear that the Crown would have led evidence to
show that the accused had stolen the property in question, as the accused was
also charged with theft. This evidence, if believed, would have supported the
conclusion that the accused knew the property was obtained from the commission
of an indictable offence in Canada, the missing averment from the possession
charge. The Crown would therefore have led evidence to prove all the elements
of the offence.

 

21.                     In
these circumstances, it is very difficult as a practical matter to argue that
the appellant was not in peril of conviction. Defence counsel, Crown counsel,
and the judge all knew that Moore was charged with possession of stolen
property, whatever the precise defect in the information. If the first trial
judge had not noticed the defect and the accused had been convicted, the
conviction would have been upheld on appeal under the principles set out in Major
and Côté. From this it follows that the accused was truly in jeopardy at
the first hearing, and the first requirement for a successful plea of autrefois
acquit has been met.

 

                                                                    V

 

Section 537

 

22.                     One
of the points raised by the appeal is the relationship between s. 537 and s.
535. In cases where an amendment was possible, does s. 537 allow an accused to
plead autrefois acquit simply from the fact that he was earlier in
jeopardy on the same charge, even if there was no final determination? If so,
the exact classification of quashing the information would not be important;
the fact of jeopardy would be decisive.

 

23.                     There
are two possible interpretations to s. 537. The first, based on the word
""might"" in para. (b), suggests that if the accused could
have been convicted on the previous count, if it had been properly amended,
then that is sufficient to allow a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois
convict. Peril of conviction would determine if the special pleas were
available. The final disposition at the former trial would be of less
importance. The second interpretation suggests that s. 537 is limited to
defining identity of charges for the purposes of the special pleas made
available by s. 535. By this view, s. 535 is the primary section and s. 537
plays an ancillary role, defining one of the elements of the special pleas.
Peril of conviction would be necessary but not determinative.

 

24.                     How
is the choice to be made between these interpretations? One consequence of the
first interpretation is that it involves a major change in the analysis of the
special pleas. The literal meanings of the names of the pleas identifies their
nature: they are concerned with previous convictions and acquittals. Anglo‑Canadian
common law has always required a disposition of the charges to allow an accused
to use the special pleas (Friedland, Double Jeopardy, at pp. 21‑26;
R. v. Charlesworth (1861), 1 B. & S. 460, 121 E.R. 786). To accept
that s. 537 focusses the inquiry almost entirely on the danger of conviction is
to accept a major change in the concept of the special pleas.

 

25.                     The
second interpretation, that s. 537 is ancillary to s. 535, suggests that s. 535
has continued the special pleas from the common law and made them available
under the Code without making a fundamental alteration in their common
law content. This interpretation is supported by the complete absence of definition
of the special pleas in s. 535, which suggests that that section simply
incorporates the common law. The reason for s. 537 is that the common law did
not allow amendments to the indictment. That absence of an amending power was
reflected in the rule that autrefois acquit was not available when an
information was quashed for technical defects (Friedland, p. 65). Section 537
changes a part of the common law principles of autrefois acquit to take
account of the new amending powers. It does not make a major change in other
parts of the requirements for autrefois acquit, which follow the common
law. In particular, s. 537 does not eliminate the need for a final disposition
of the charge, which has always been a requirement for autrefois acquit
or convict at common law. The marginal notes for s. 537, ""What
determines identity"" and ""Allowance of special plea in part"" are
consistent with this interpretation of s. 537 and are another small indication
that s. 537 defines ""identity"" for the purposes of the special pleas
without defining the special pleas in their entirety.

 

26.                     This
interpretation of the role of s. 537 is also consistent with this Court's
recent cases on autrefois acquit. In both Riddle and Petersen,
supra, the Court indicated that a disposition in the nature of a final
determination is an essential element of a plea of autrefois acquit.
Since a final disposition is required generally for autrefois acquit, s.
537 should not be read as an exception to that requirement when the possibility
of an amendment is raised. The section should be read as a guide to the
relationship between the amending powers and the requirement of identity.

 

27.                     I
have not been able to find any case that gives a detailed examination of s. 537
and the role that it plays in relation to s. 535, but there are several cases
that make some mention of the section. The lower courts have used the section
to guide their decision whether or not charges at one trial are identical to
those at an earlier trial. For example, in R. v. Rinnie, [1970] 3 C.C.C.
218 (Alta. C.A.), the accused was acquitted of a charge of attempted murder.
The Crown then charged him with causing bodily harm with intent to wound and he
was convicted, notwithstanding a plea of autrefois acquit. The Appeal
Division upheld the conviction. The second charge was not an included offence
of the first, nor was the first charge defective. No amendment could have been
made to the first charge under s. 510  (the predecessor to s. 529 ) so the
charges were not identical under s. 518 (the predecessor to s. 537). The
section's role was limited to determining identity in the case of amendments
but had no application to the question of included offences. While the result
in this case may not now be consistent with the principle of Kienapple v.
The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, and s. 11 (h) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , its interpretation of s. 537  is consistent
with the idea that the section relates only to questions of identity when there
was a possibility of an amendment to the first information.

 

28.                     R.
v. Ko and Yip, [1977] 3 W.W.R. 447 (B.C.C.A.) involved two trials for
trafficking in heroin, both arising out of the same transaction. The accused
were charged and convicted at a first trial for delivering a small sample from
a pound of heroin, and then charged and convicted at a second trial for
delivery of the rest of the pound. McIntyre J.A., as he then was, analyzed the
two charges in terms of s. 537. Although there were two separate deliveries,
both counts were very generally worded and the evidence at the first trial
included some mention of the delivery of the pound. McIntyre J.A. held that
without any amendments at all the accused could have been convicted at the
first trial for delivery of the pound. The charges were therefore identical and
autrefois acquit was available at the second trial. Section 537 was used
as a guide to questions of identity when the issue was not clear‑cut.

 

29.                     R.
v. Tateham (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 25 (B.C. Co. Ct.), involved the
interpretation to be given to a stay of proceedings. The Crown wished to
introduce transcript evidence at trial but the trial judge refused to admit it.
The Crown then entered a stay and re‑laid the charges. The matter came on
before a second judge who refused a plea of autrefois acquit, admitted
the transcript evidence and convicted the accused. He held that s. 535 requires
that an acquittal be entered before autrefois acquit is available.
Section 537 does not mean that autrefois acquit is available whenever an
accused has pleaded to a charge and the trial has begun. The conviction was
upheld by the Court of Appeal ((1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 565), which emphasized
this Court's position in Riddle that a final judgment on the charge is
essential for a successful plea of autrefois acquit.

 

30.                     Finally,
the Ontario Court of Appeal held in R. v. Plank (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d)
386, that when a person is acquitted on an information that could have been
amended to provide for an included offence, acquittal is a bar to a trial on
the included offence. The accused was charged with impaired driving, but the
evidence showed only care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired. The
Crown moved to amend but the court refused the amendment and acquitted. The
Crown then laid an information charging care and control and the accused pleaded
autrefois acquit. This plea was upheld by Brooke J.A. for the Court of
Appeal, even though he thought the trial judge should have considered whether
care and control was an included offence. Section 537 was interpreted only to
relate to specific issues of identity of charges, not to the requirement of a
final disposition.

 

31.                     This
review of the use made of s. 537 by the lower courts suggests that it has not
changed the requirements for a final conviction or acquittal, recognised by the
common law and repeated in Riddle and Petersen. The section is to
be used to decide whether or not charges are identical, but identity of charges
alone does not make the special pleas available. A final determination
equivalent to an acquittal is still necessary.

 

                                                                   VI

 

Final Disposition

 

32.                     The
next question is thus to ask whether the action of the first trial judge in
this case was a final disposition equivalent to an acquittal, such that the
plea of autrefois acquit is available.

 

33.                     In
Riddle, the Crown asked for an adjournment on the day of trial because
the complainant was not present. The court refused the adjournment and called
on the Crown to present its case. When the Crown led no evidence, the trial
judge dismissed the charges against the accused. A week later, the information
was re‑sworn and a second trial held, at which the accused pleaded autrefois
acquit.

 

34.                     This
Court held that the plea was good. The Crown should not be able to decline to
lead evidence to support its case and then assert that the decision of the
trial court is irrelevant to a later information. Nor should it be able to
avoid the effects of a refusal to adjourn by simply laying a new information.
The Court in Riddle rejected the argument that a trial ""on the
merits"" was necessary for a successful plea of autrefois acquit,
partly because that phrase has no statutory basis and partly because it was
used in an inaccurate way, not truly capturing the principle underlying the
plea of autrefois acquit. A case can be finally adjudicated in law
without ever reaching the factual allegations which form the basis for the
charge. Whenever there is a final adjudication, the matter is res judicata
and the accused can use the special pleas if charged again.

 

35.                     Many
cases raise more than one legal issue, any one of which can be determinative if
decided in favour of the accused. The trial court is required to dispose of
each question raised at various stages in the proceedings. It is only where no
issue is decided against the Crown along the way that the court reaches the
central issue of whether the conduct of the accused amounted to a criminal
offence. A decision at an earlier stage on a decisive point of law can be a
determination equivalent to an acquittal or dismissal, sufficient for autrefois
acquit. On the other hand, there are legal issues, as this case
exemplifies, that are not directly connected to the substantive issues raised
by a case, but which must be considered and decided by the court. Some errors
by the Crown in the process of bringing an accused to trial, at least in the
early stages of criminal proceedings, will not automatically give an accused
immunity from any further proceedings.

 

36.                     Whether
or not a judicial determination that ends proceedings will support a plea of autrefois
acquit will depend on the nature of the legal basis for the decision.
Decisions based on substantive legal principles will generally support a plea
of autrefois acquit. Riddle is an example of this sort of
decision. The Crown was called upon to prove its case against the accused and
could not do so. The courts should not try to distinguish cases where the Crown
fails to lead evidence or leads insufficient evidence. Either way, the Crown
has failed to prove its case and the accused is entitled not to be subjected to
another trial. Decisions based on procedure are more complex. Some decisions
may end defective proceedings without barring the Crown from starting anew;
other decisions may amount to a final determination that can be appealed but
cannot be replaced by new proceedings. It would be difficult, if not impossible,
to devise a formula which would precisely cover all possible situations.
Without attempting to identify all the factors involved, three that are
important to the decision are the nature of the defect involved, the stage in
the proceedings at which it is raised, and the degree of prejudice to the
accused.

 

37.                     A
review of the cases decided under the old Crown appeal provisions helps to
demonstrate this principle. In one line of cases, decisions that ended the
proceedings were held to be equivalent to acquittals; in the other, the
decisions were not final for appeal purposes. In the first group of cases,
there was an adjudication of legal issues raised by the case, even though the
court never reached the particular factual allegations that were at the heart
of the offence. The decisions were considered final because those legal issues
were determinative in those cases. See Lattoni and Corbo v. The Queen,
[1958] S.C.R. 603; R. v. Sheets, supra; Cheyenne Realty Ltd.
v. Thompson, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 87, and R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128.

 

38.                     The
common thread to all these cases is that a question of law was raised which, if
decided in favour of the accused, meant that no prosecution of the charge could
ever continue to a formal acquittal or conviction. In Lattoni and Corbo,
the accused argued that the charge was prescribed. In Sheets, it was
held that the accused did not come within the definition of
""official"", a necessary first step for a conviction under the offence
charged. In Cheyenne Realty Ltd., the accused challenged the validity of
the by‑law under which it was charged. The Crown led no evidence in Riddle.
In Jewitt, a judicial stay of proceedings was entered because of police
entrapment. In each of these cases, a judicial determination had been made
which, if correct, was sufficient to dispose of the charges permanently in the
accused's favour. The trial judge had considered the charges and made a final
decision. If the Crown disagreed with the decision, its remedy was to appeal.

 

39.                     By
way of contrast, there is another series of cases where a disposition was held
not to be equivalent to an acquittal or dismissal: Kipp v. Attorney‑General
for Ontario, [1965] S.C.R. 57; R. v. Tonner (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d)
132 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and Judd
(1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 169 (B.C.C.A.) In Kipp, erroneously quashing an
indictment for duplicity was held not to be tantamount to a dismissal. The
indictment was there quashed on a pre‑trial motion, before plea. This
Court upheld an order for mandamus, saying that the issue had to be tried and
was not affected by an erroneous preliminary decision on the form of the
indictment. Kipp was applied in Tonner, where the Ontario Court
of Appeal held that there was no Crown appeal from the quashing of an
indictment for duplicity, since the disposition in that case did not amount to
an acquittal on the charges. In G. & P. International News Ltd., the
British Columbia Court of Appeal held that an erroneous quashing of an
indictment for formal defects did not amount to a verdict of acquittal, since
the decision was merely procedural or technical in nature.

 

40.                     The
guiding principle in these cases is just the opposite of the other line of
cases. Here, the basis of the judgment under consideration, whether or not
correctly decided, was of a formal, technical nature. The decisions turned on
points of law, but were not directly connected to the substantive issues raised
by the offence charged. The questions raised in these cases all related to the
process by which the case was brought before the courts, rather than to the
adjudication of the legal and factual issues of the offence charged.

 

41.                     In
R. v. Jewitt this Court stated, at p. 147‑48:

 

                   On a true reading of s. 605(1)(a) of the Code,
to determine whether a stay of proceedings is a judgment or verdict of
acquittal, we must look to the substance of the action of the trial judge and
not the label he used in disposing of the case. Substance and not form should
govern. Whatever the words used, the judge intended to make a final order
disposing of the charge against the respondent. If the order of the Court
effectively brings the proceedings to a final conclusion in favour of an
accused then I am of opinion that, irrespective of the terminology used, it is
tantamount to a judgment or verdict of acquittal and therefore appealable by
the Crown.

 

The exact form of a
decision does not decide the availability of autrefois acquit: it is the
reason for the decision and its substantive effect that govern. Whether or not
a particular decision supports a plea of autrefois acquit will depend in
part on the facts of each case. In Jewitt, the stay for abuse of process
was held to be a final determination that could be appealed under the then s.
605. The stay in that case would also have supported a plea of autrefois
acquit.

 

42.                     The
Court in Jewitt also addressed the question of a quashing of an
indictment, at p. 141:

 

                   From this review, it can be concluded that quashing
an indictment is tantamount to an acquittal where (a) the decision to quash is
not based on defects in the indictment or technical procedural irregularities,
and (b) the decision is a final decision resting on a question of law alone,
such that if the accused were charged subsequently with the same offence he or
she could plead autrefois acquit.

 

43.                     I
have left to the last a discussion of Petersen v. The Queen, supra.
In that case, the trial judge, after a series of adjournments, held that there
was nothing in the record to show that the accused had consented to
adjournments of greater than eight days, as required by s. 738. He held that he
had lost jurisdiction and dismissed the charges. A new information was sworn
and the Crown began a new trial by indictment. This Court applied Riddle
and upheld a plea of autrefois acquit, saying that the Crown had no
right to lay new charges and could only appeal the decision of the trial judge
concerning jurisdiction.

 

44.                     The
Court in that case does not appear to have considered an earlier decision of
this Court, the case of Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, which
examined the effects of an adjournment of more than eight days without the
accused's consent, under s. 465(1)(b) of the Code. Justice
Ritchie for the Court held that a breach of that section meant a loss of
jurisdiction over both the accused and the ""offence"", but he also
held that ""offence"" in this context referred to the information and
that further proceedings based upon a new information would be possible (at p.
610):

 

                   Much of the difficulty in this area has, I think,
been occasioned by the use of the phrase ""jurisdiction over the offence"".
In my opinion the word ""offence"" as used in this phrase must be
construed as meaning the ""information"" charging the accused with the
offence and the result of an error such as occurred in the present case is, in
my view, that that information is to be treated as if it had never been laid. This
in no way affects the jurisdiction of the court in relation to the
""offence"" itself so as to preclude the laying of another information
in the same jurisdiction charging the same offence. This result, I think, follows
from the case of Trenholm v. Attorney General of Ontario, [[1940] S.C.R.
303]. [Emphasis added.]

 

45.                     The
closing passage in Petersen is as follows (at pp. 502‑3):

 

                   In the facts of this case I am of the view that the
appellant was put in jeopardy, and the summary conviction court dismissed the
informations thus giving the appellant such a determination of the issue that
it could be raised in bar of any later proceedings on the same charge. The fact
that the provincial court judge may have made an error in law in dismissing the
informations does not alter the situation. He made an order. Assuming, as I do,
that his order was wrong, it nonetheless disposed of the informations. Such an
order, though voidable, must stand, however, until it is rescinded, quashed, or
reversed on appeal. It was therefore in force and effect when the plea of autrefois
acquit was raised and it should have received effect. This is not to say
the Crown was left without remedy in the face of judicial error. The Crown
could have appealed; it might have had the right to relief by prerogative
proceedings, but it could not simply conclude that the summary conviction
court's order was ex facie a nullity and ignore it by commencing new
proceedings. By this approach, the Crown has foregone its remedy and a plea
of autrefois acquit should have succeeded. I would allow the appeal.
[Emphasis added.]

 

It is very difficult
to reconcile the holdings in Doyle and Petersen on this point.

 

46.                     Whether
or not autrefois acquit is available will depend on the nature of the
legal decision made at the earlier trial. Doyle established that the
failure to respect the adjournment provisions is a serious procedural error, one
that ends the proceedings before the court, but it does not preclude subsequent
proceedings on a new information, subject of course to any applicable
limitation period or possible abuse of process. This approach to the problem of
loss of jurisdiction caused by procedural defects is consistent with the
principles of autrefois acquit outlined earlier. It follows that the
holding in Petersen, which did not consider Doyle, went too far
in its application of autrefois acquit. In any event, Petersen
certainly should not be extended and applied here. We must not lose sight of
the fact that the common law rule has always been that subsequent proceedings
are not precluded by the quashing of a defective charge. While the analysis
leading to that same result must now take into account the more flexible modern
policy regarding technical defects, amendments, and appeals, the justice of the
result reached has not changed.

 

47.                     Much
of the debate in the cases on the Crown's right of appeal, cited earlier, and
in older decisions under the common law, centred on the absence of any remedy
for technical defects in an information, other than to quash the defective
information and begin again with a new information. In these circumstances, the
Crown's power to re‑lay charges was necessary to ensure that a well‑founded
charge could be heard and adjudicated. The law in this area has now been
altered, with extensive powers to amend and to appeal. The most recent change
was in 1985, when the Attorney General was given the power to appeal stays,
quashes, and refusals to exercise jurisdiction, in addition to the previous
right to appeal ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal."" (See the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1985, S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 137, which added new
paras. (b) and (c) to s. 605(1).) Do these changes mean that the
rationale for the common law rule no longer exists and that an appeal is the
only available recourse?

 

48.                     I
have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague, Lamer J. With the
greatest respect, I cannot agree that because the Crown has a right of appeal,
an appeal is its only recourse. The argument based on the availability of an
appeal overlooks the long‑term effects. If every decision of a trial
judge to quash must be appealed by the Crown, the costs and delays of criminal
proceedings, already high and long, will increase further. Such appeals would
focus solely on the procedural points raised by the applications to quash or
amend, rather than on the substantive issues raised by the charges. If the
Crown is successful on appeal, the trial would continue with the possibility of
a second appeal, this time on the issues raised by the charges themselves. It
has always been a principle of criminal procedure that multiple appeals should
be avoided and a case should move as a whole up the court system (Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, per McIntyre J.; Criminal Code ,
s. 602 ). When a count is quashed for technical defects entirely unrelated to
the substantive legal and factual issues raised by the charge and when the
accused is not prejudiced or caught by surprise, it is difficult to see why a
lengthy appeal process is more favourable to the accused than a simple re‑laying
of the charges. The accused can always challenge the validity of the new charge
at the trial before the second judge, by pleading autrefois acquit as in
this case, or perhaps by a motion for a stay for abuse of process. If the
accused is unsuccessful at the second trial, the judge's decision can be
appealed along with any other grounds of appeal. The case would then move up
the court system as a whole. Overall, single appeals rather than multiple
appeals work to everyone's advantage, including that of the accused.

 

49.                     There
are many possible reasons for allowing or refusing an amendment. Section 529(4)
sets out five factors the court shall consider. Only two of these factors
concern prejudice and injustice (s. 529(4)(d) and (e)). A judge
may well decide to refuse an amendment and quash an information based on the
other three factors, namely, matters disclosed at the preliminary inquiry,
evidence taken at trial, and the circumstances of the case. Where the
motivating factor for refusing an amendment is that to allow it would be
prejudicial to the accused, very often such a disposition will be tantamount to
an acquittal, and as a subsequent charge will be precluded by autrefois
acquit, the Crown's only recourse would be to appeal. But in my view that
does not mean that all refusals of amendments should be accorded this
treatment. Where a judge quashes an information for technical defects at an
early stage of the proceedings, with no prejudice to the accused, I do not
think that the Crown is thereby barred from correcting its error by laying a
new information.

 

50.                     I
also do not think that the fact that a second trial judge will be required to
review the first trial judge's decision suggests that an appeal is the only
recourse. Any time an accused pleads autrefois acquit, the trial judge
will have to review the decision of another trial judge to determine if the
charges are identical, if the first court had jurisdiction, and if there was a
disposition tantamount to an acquittal. Any of these inquiries could involve a
review of a legal decision made by the first judge. For example, if the second
judge decides that the first court erroneously assumed jurisdiction, the second
court would be required to reject the special plea in spite of the first
court's decision. While it is unusual for one trial judge to review the
decision made by another trial judge, the nature of the special pleas requires
that review.

 

51.                     In
summary, not every judicial decision that stems the trial process will support
a plea of autrefois acquit. A court has broad powers to remedy defective
process, but when it decides that the errors cannot be remedied the decision on
that procedural point does not necessarily block a further prosecution, subject
to concerns about abuse of process and prejudice to the accused.

 

52.                     The
defect in the information in this case was of a technical nature. Although it
related to the elements of the offence charged, the reason for the quashing in
no way was an adjudication on the legal or factual issues raised by the
information. The first trial judge made no comment on the accused's legal liability,
or even addressed his mind to the issue. Without making any adjudication on the
accused's guilt, the trial judge simply held that the Crown had not correctly
started the trial and the allegations could not be properly heard at that
stage. Nor can it be said that the accused was prejudiced by the defect. He was
not caught by surprise nor had he built his defence around it. The technical
error was caught at a very early stage in the trial, before the Crown had even
led evidence. While it may be the case that technical errors in an information
can sometimes prejudice the accused so that a quashing amounts to an acquittal,
it is not the case here.

 

53.                     Overall,
the quashing in this case does not meet the test established in Jewitt.
There was no adjudication on the legal or factual issues raised. While a
decision on a point of law, it is not a final decision. As a result, autrefois
acquit is not available to the accused in this case.

 

                                                                  VII

 

Conclusion

 

54.                     In
this case, and in summary, the information was quashed for technical reasons,
at an early stage of the proceedings. That disposition did not relate to the
substantive legal and factual issues raised by the charge. There was no
prejudice to the accused. The Crown had the power to re‑lay the charges
and the plea of autrefois acquit should be rejected. The appeal should
be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside, and the conviction
restored.

 

                   The
judgment of McIntyre, Lamer, Le Dain and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

55.                     Lamer J.‑‑The
Chief Justice has set out the facts, analyzed the judgments below, and
identified the issue to be decided in this case, namely, ``...whether quashing
an information, after plea, for failure to allege a material averment
constitutes a verdict of acquittal for the purpose of pleading autrefois
acquit to a new information.""

 

56.                     There
appears to be no disagreement, either between ourselves or with the judges
below, as regards the fact that, acting under s. 529 of the Code, the
judge erred in quashing the information. Indeed, the information was not a
nullity but only voidable and the accused was clearly in jeopardy of being
convicted when the judge quashed the information. On this it is without any
reservation that I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice. I also agree
with his analysis of s. 537 and that, added to the requirement that the accused
must have been put in jeopardy, there must also have been a final determination
equivalent to an acquittal.

 

57.                     My
respectful disagreement with the Chief Justice is in the qualification to be
given to a quashing by a judge when he does so acting, at trial, under the
authority of s. 529 . I find it necessary to reproduce s. 529  in its entirety.

 

                   529. (1) An objection
to an indictment or to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent on the
face thereof shall be taken by motion to quash the indictment or count before
the accused has pleaded, and thereafter only by leave of the court or judge
before whom the trial takes place, and a court or judge before whom an
objection is taken under this section may, if it is considered necessary, order
the indictment or count to be amended to cure the defect.

 

                   (2) A court may, on the trial of an indictment,
amend the indictment or a count thereof or a particular that is furnished under
section 516, to make the indictment, count or particular conform to the
evidence, where there appears to be a variance between the evidence and

 

(a) the charge in a count in the indictment as found; or

 

(b) the charge in a count in the indictment

 

(i) as amended, or

 

(ii) as it would have been if it had been amended in conformity with
any particular that has been furnished pursuant to section 516.

 

                   (3) A court shall, upon the arraignment of an
accused, or at any stage of the trial, amend the indictment or a count thereof
as may be necessary where it appears

 

(a) that the indictment has been preferred

 

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of Canada instead of this Act,
or

 

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act of the Parliament of Canada;

 

(b) that the indictment or a count thereof

 

(i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to
constitute the offence,

 

(ii) does not negative an exception that should be negatived,

 

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

 

and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed
by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or

 

(c) that the indictment or a count thereof is in any way
defective in form.

 

                   (4) The court shall, in considering whether or not
an amendment should be made, consider

 

(a) the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry,

 

(b) the evidence taken on the trial, if any,

 

(c) the circumstances of the case,

 

(d) whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his
defence by a variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3),
and

 

(e) whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the
proposed amendment can be made without injustice being done.

 

                   (5) Where, in the opinion of the court, the accused
has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or omission
in an indictment or a count thereof, the court may, if it is of the opinion
that the misleading or prejudice may be removed by an adjournment, adjourn the
trial to a subsequent day in the same sittings or the next sittings of the
court and may make such an order with respect to the payment of costs resulting
from the necessity for amendment as it considers desirable.

 

                   (6) The question whether an order to amend an indictment
or a count thereof should be granted or refused is a question of law.

 

                   (7) An order to amend an indictment or a count
thereof shall be endorsed on the indictment as part of the record and the trial
shall proceed as if the indictment or count had been originally found as
amended.

 

                   (8) A mistake in the heading of an indictment shall
be corrected as soon as it is discovered but, whether corrected or not, is not
material.

 

                   (9) The authority of a court to amend indictments
does not authorize the court to add to the overt acts stated in an indictment
for high treason or treason or for an offence against any provision in sections
49, 50, 51 and 53.

 

58.                     Since
the enactment of our Code in 1892 there has been, through case law and
punctual amendments to s. 529  and its predecessor sections, a gradual shift
from requiring judges to quash to requiring them to amend in the stead; in
fact, there remains little discretion to quash. Of course, if the charge is an
absolute nullity, an occurrence the conditions of which the Chief Justice has
set out clearly in his reasons, no cure is available as the matter goes to the
very jurisdiction of the judge. In such a case, the doctrine of autrefois
acquit is never a bar to the relaying of the charge because the accused was
never in jeopardy and the disposition of the charge through quashing was for
lack of jurisdiction. Also, if and when a charge is laid before that or another
judge, it will be the first time the accused is in jeopardy before a judge
having jurisdiction on the accused and the subject matter. There was nothing to
be acquitted of, and for this reason, there is no ""autrefois"",
as there was no offence, and no ""acquit"" as there was no
jurisdiction to acquit or convict. But, if the charge is only voidable, the
judge has jurisdiction to amend. Even failure to state something that is an
essential ingredient of the offence (and I am referring to s. 529(3)(b)(i))
is not fatal; in fact, it is far from being fatal, as the section commands that
the judge ""shall"" amend.

 

59.                     My
understanding of s. 529 , when read in its entirety, is that it commands the
following to the trial judge: absent absolute nullity and subject to certain
limits set out in subs. (9), the judge has very wide powers to cure any defect
in a charge by amending it; if the mischief to be cured by amendment has misled
or prejudiced the accused in his defence, the judge must then determine whether
the misleading or prejudice may be removed by an adjournment. If so, he must
amend, adjourn and thereafter proceed. But, if the required amendment cannot be
made without injustice being done, then and only then the judge is to quash. Therefore,
a judge must not quash a charge, and it is reversible error of law if he does,
unless he has come to that conclusion, namely that ""the proposed
amendment"" cannot ""be made without injustice being done"".
However if having determined, as a matter of law (see subs. (6)), that an
amendment cannot be made without causing irreparable prejudice, his quashing of
the charge at the trial is then, in my view, tantamount to an acquittal. This
is equally true whether, to terminate the proceedings under s. 529 , the judge
uses the word ""quash"", ""dismiss"", ""discharge"" or
""acquit"". With respect, this to me is obvious, because relaying
before another judge an amended charge would be no less prejudicial to the
accused than the amendment of the first one by the previous judge. Sections
529(4) and (5) would then be a useless exercise of judgment.

 

60.                     It
has been suggested that the factors, other than those related to prejudice, to
be considered by the trial judge under s. 529(4) are indicative of the fact
that irreparable prejudice is not necessarily the ultimate factor to determine
whether to amend or quash. This with respect is to read s. 529  with an
""all‑or‑nothing"" approach, that is, that the judge must
either amend or quash. The factors listed under s. 529(4) are, as the opening
words of the subsection indicate, relevant to determine whether there should be
an amendment, and not whether the judge should amend or quash. Quashing
will occur only if there is irreparable prejudice. A judge may well come to the
conclusion that there is no need to quash because there is no prejudice to the
accused, without necessarily concluding that there need be an amendment. Such
could be the case where the defect is one of pure form as contemplated by s.
529(3)(c). If there is irreparable prejudice, there is no amendment
available. A contrario, however, there need not always be an amendment.
In other words, the question whether one quashes or not is not on all fours
with whether one, absent irreparable prejudice, amends or not.

 

61.                     What
is misleading here is that it is clear to us, as it was to the Court of Appeal,
that the judge quashed when he clearly should not have, as an amendment would
not have caused any prejudice to the accused. However, this is no reason to
allow the Crown to lay an amended charge once the accused has been acquitted,
albeit by error. The trial judge's decision is open to appeal. Assuming error
is found, the Court of Appeal will direct him to amend and hear the case, or
will amend the charge itself and then return the file to the judge for trial on
the amended charge. The fact that this will result in the accused being tried
on the amended charge in any event, is no reason for downgrading the
""quashing"" so as to permit the Crown to relay an amended charge
without facing a special plea. When a judge quashes under s. 529 , that decision
is deemed without error until reversed by a Court of Appeal. Otherwise the
second judge, ordinarily of the same jurisdiction, when assessing whether the
""quashing"" is or is not tantamount to an acquittal for the purpose of
determining whether there is autrefois acquit, would have to determine
whether his colleague was or was not in error in deciding to quash.

 

62.                     Finally,
I have not changed my mind as regards the concurrence I gave to my brother
McIntyre in Petersen v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 493. I have, with
respect, no difficulty whatsoever reconciling our Court's decision in Petersen
with our previous decision in Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597. Petersen
was dealing with the termination of proceedings at a trial, albeit a summary
conviction, while in Doyle, the proceedings were terminated at a
preliminary inquiry. The latter lacks the required ""jeopardy"",
amongst other differences in nature between the two types of proceedings.
Furthermore, in Petersen, supra, as in the case at bar, the Crown
simply ignored the disposition of a case in a court of record and commenced new
proceedings on the same information, alleging the same cause, while leaving the
record in the court below unchallenged. I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british
columbia

 








Constitutional law ‑‑ Charter of Rights  ‑‑
Presumption of innocence ‑‑ Care or control of a motor vehicle
while impaired ‑‑ Whether presumption of care or control based upon
occupancy of the driver's seat in s. 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code violates s.
11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ‑‑ If so,
whether such violation justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter.

 

Criminal law ‑‑ Care or control of a motor
vehicle while impaired ‑‑ Presumption of innocence ‑‑
Whether s. 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code contravenes the presumption of
innocence in s. 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

 








The
accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while
impaired contrary to s. 234  of the Criminal Code . He was found in the
driver's seat of his car with his body slumped over the steering wheel. The car
was parked along the roadside, the dashboard ignition light was on, the key was
in the ignition, but the engine was not running. The defence conceded that the
accused's ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. At his trial,
the accused argued that the statutory presumption contained in s. 237(1)(a)
of the Code was inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  which guarantees the right to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty. Section 237(1) (a) provided that in any proceedings
under s. 234  or 236 , ""where it is proved that the accused occupied the
seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he shall be deemed
to have had the care or control of the vehicle unless he establishes that he
did not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in
motion"". The trial judge rejected the argument. He held that since s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  used the same language as s. 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the right to be presumed innocent should be interpreted the
same way. Applying the decision of this Court in R. v. Appleby, [1972]
S.C.R. 303, the trial judge convicted the accused. In supplementary reasons
issued seven months after conviction, he added that in the absence of the
presumption in s. 237(1) (a), he would have acquitted the accused. The
conviction was affirmed by the County Court and the majority of the Court of
Appeal.

 

Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Despite
the holding in Appleby that s. 237(1)(a) of the Code does
not infringe the presumption of innocence found in s. 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the question of the validity of s. 237(1)(a) in the
face of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is still an open one. Although
the same important principle is involved, it is the nature of the two documents
which gives the presumption of innocence different effects under the Canadian
Bill of Rights and the Charter . Indeed, a constitutional document is
fundamentally different from a statute. The purpose of the Charter  is to
entrench certain basic rights and freedoms and immunize them from legislative
encroachments. Ordinary legislation must conform to the constitutional
requirements. An interpretation of s. 11 (d) that would make the
presumption of innocence subject to legislative exceptions would run directly
contrary to the overall purpose of an entrenched constitutional document.

 

The
Court's characterization in Appleby of the legal effect of the
presumption contained in s. 237(1)(a) continues to be relevant under the
Charter . The presumption places an onus on the accused to prove on a
balance of probabilities that he did not enter the vehicle with the intention
of setting it in motion. The word ""establishes"" requires the accused
to prove the necessary fact on the balance of probabilities, and cannot be read
as equivalent to ""raises a reasonable doubt"".

 








The
exact characterization of a factor as an essential element, a collateral
factor, an excuse, or a defence should not affect the analysis of the
presumption of innocence. It is the final effect of a provision on the verdict
that is decisive. If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance
of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of
innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the
mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused.

 

A
statutory presumption infringes the presumption of innocence if it requires the
trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt. Only if the existence
of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the conclusion that the essential
element exists, with no other reasonable possibilities, will the statutory
presumption be constitutionally valid. In the present case, s. 237(1)(a)
creates a presumption that a person in the driver's seat of a vehicle has the
care or control of the vehicle, one of the elements of the offence under s.
234 . It cannot be said that proof of occupancy of the driver's seat leads
inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element of care or control
exists. Other reasonable explanations for sitting in the driver's seat can
readily be imagined. Since section 237(1)(a) requires the trier of fact
to accept as proven that an accused had care or control of a vehicle, in spite
of a reasonable doubt about the existence of that element, the section breaches
the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 








Section
237(1)(a) of the Code is justifiable under s. 1  of the Charter .
The objective that s. 237(1) (a) is designed to serve‑‑the
protection of the public against drunk drivers‑‑is sufficiently
important to warrant overriding a constitutionally‑protected right.
Viewed in the context of its overall statutory setting, the provision has a
rational connection to the objective and represents a restrained parliamentary
response to a pressing social problem. In enacting s. 237(1) (a),
Parliament struck a compromise: on the one hand, the Crown need only prove a
minimal level of intent on account of the fact that consumption of alcohol is
itself an ingredient of the offence of ""care or control""; on the
other hand, where an accused can show that he had some reason for entering the
vehicle and occupying the driver's seat other than to drive the vehicle, the
accused will escape conviction. It was an attempt to balance the dangers posed
by a person whose abilities to reason are impaired by alcohol with the desire
to avoid absolute liability offences. Finally, there is a proportionality
between the effects of the impugned measures on the protected right and the
attainment of the objective. The threat to public safety posed by drinking and
driving has been established by evidence in this case and recognized by this
Court in others. While section 237(1)(a) does infringe the right
guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it does so in the context
of a statutory setting which makes it impracticable to require the Crown to
prove an intention to drive.

APPEAL
from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1983), 6 D.L.R. (4th)
263, 10 C.C.C. (3d) 277, 10 C.R.R. 344, 38 C.R. (3d) 24, 25 M.V.R. 22,
dismissing the accused's appeal from a judgment of Cowan Co. Ct. J. (1983), 21
M.V.R. 69, which affirmed the accused's conviction of having care or control of
a motor vehicle while impaired. Appeal dismissed.

 

T. L. Robertson, Q.C., and Brian Shaw, for the appellant.

 

Dennis Murray, Q.C., and Richard Isaac, for the respondent.

 

Julius A. Isaac, Q.C., and D. J. Avison, for the intervener.

 

The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1.                                                                        The Chief Justice‑‑Section
234(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, provides that
every one who drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, while his ability to drive a motor
vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, is guilty of an indictable offence or
an offence punishable on summary conviction. Section 237(1)(a) then
legislates a presumption against an accused to the following effect:

 

237. (1) In any proceedings under section
234  or 236 ,

 

(a) where
it is proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the
driver of a motor vehicle, he shall be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the vehicle
for the purpose of setting it in motion;

 








2.                                                                        The
issue in this appeal is whether this provision infringes the rights of the
accused under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

3.                                                                        Section
11 (d) of the Charter  reads:

 

11. Any person charged with an offence
has the right

 

                                                                                                                                        ...

 

(d) to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

4.                                                                        Section
2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44 , reads:

 

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it
is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall
operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and
applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to

 

                                                                                                                                        ...

 

(f) deprive
a person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without
just cause;

 

Leave
to appeal to this Court was sought on a number of points, but denied except
with respect to the following ground which formed the basis for Hutcheon J.A.'s
dissent in the British Columbia Court of Appeal:

 








Did
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in law in holding that the reverse
onus provision in Section 237(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada is not
inconsistent with Section 11 (d) of the Charter of Rights  and Freedoms and of no
force and effect.

 

Later,
pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, the
following constitutional questions were stated for consideration by this Court:

 

1.         Does
section 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C‑34, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.         If
section 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code  infringes or denies the
rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter , is
this section justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not inconsistent
with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

5.                                                                        The
Attorney General of Canada intervened to support the constitutionality of the
legislation.

 

6.                                                                        It
should be noted that this case has been argued throughout on the law as it
stood prior to the amendments made by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985,
S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 36.

The
Facts

 








7.                                                                        The
evidence disclosed that when the investigating constables came upon the
appellant's vehicle, it was in a parked position along the roadside, its hood
was warm, the dashboard ignition light was on, keys were in the ignition, but
the engine was not running. The appellant was seated in the driver's seat with
his body slumped over the steering wheel. Counsel for the defence concedes that
the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol when
he was found by the police.

Decisions
of the British Columbia Courts

 

1. Provincial
Court

 

8.                                                                        The
accused was tried by Coultas Prov. Ct. J. on September 10, 1982: [1983] B.C.D.
Crim. Conv. 5600‑01. He argued that the presumption contained in s.
237(1)(a) violated paras. (c) and (d) of s. 11  of the Charter ,
which guarantee the right not to be forced to testify against oneself and the
right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

 








9.                                                                        Coultas
Prov. Ct. J. rejected these arguments. He held that since s. 11 (d) of
the Charter  used the same language as s. 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the right to be presumed innocent guaranteed by the two
documents should be interpreted in the same way. The trial judge considered
himself bound by the decision of this Court in R. v. Appleby, [1972]
S.C.R. 303. In that case, Ritchie J. for the majority held that the right to be
presumed innocent was subject to statutory exceptions, and that the presumption
of care or control based upon occupancy of the driver's seat did not violate s.
2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The trial judge also relied
on the concurring reasons of Laskin J. who held that an accused can lose the
initial benefit of silence once the Crown leads evidence of certain facts. He
concluded that s. 237(1) (a) did not violate the presumption of
innocence. The trial judge also rejected the argument that the section violated
the accused's right not to testify. He then convicted the accused. In
supplementary reasons for judgment delivered seven months after conviction and
shortly before the hearing in the County Court, Coultas Prov. Ct. J. stated
that but for the presumption in s. 237(1) (a), which was not rebutted, he
would have acquitted the accused.

 

2. County
Court

 

10.                                                                     The
accused appealed his conviction: (1983), 21 M.V.R. 69. The sole issue
considered by Cowan Co. Ct. J. was whether s. 237(1)(a) contravened the
presumption of innocence. Cowan Co. Ct. J. in dismissing the appeal said (at p.
73):

 

Section 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights is in almost identical language to that in s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
except for the substitution of ""an offence"" in the Charter  for the
words ""a criminal offence"" in s. 2 (f).

 

That being so, I consider that the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Appleby applies with equal
force to the Charter  and is decisive of the issue before me.

 

3. British
Columbia Court of Appeal

 








11.                                                                     The
accused appealed the decision of the County Court to the Court of Appeal:
(1983), 6 D.L.R. (4th) 263, 10 C.C.C. (3d) 277, 10 C.R.R. 344, 38 C.R. (3d) 24,
25 M.V.R. 22. In separate reasons, Taggart and Esson JJ.A. held that there was
no violation of s. 11 (d) and dismissed the appeal, while Hutcheon J.A.
reached the opposite conclusion. It should be pointed out that the decision of
this Court in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, had not been rendered
prior to the disposition of the present case by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal.

 

12.                                                                     Taggart
J.A. reviewed the two leading cases on s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights; Appleby, supra, and R. v. Shelley, [1981] 2
S.C.R. 196, as well as Re Boyle and The Queen (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 193
(Ont. C.A.), which considered s. 11 (d). He concluded that the purpose of
s. 2(f) and s. 11 (d) is to protect an accused from statutory
provisions which arbitrarily shift to the accused the ultimate burden of
establishing innocence. Factors to consider in deciding if the ultimate burden
has been placed on the accused included the ""rational connection""
test, the ""impossibility of proof"" test, the nature of the burden on
the accused and the degree of proof required to discharge the burden. Turning
to s. 237(1)(a), Taggart J.A. noted that in order to gain the benefit of
the presumption created by s. 237(1)(a), the Crown must first prove that
the accused occupied the driver's seat and that the accused was impaired. In
Taggart J.A.'s view, the deemed fact of care or control flows rationally from
the presumed fact, occupation of the driver's seat by the accused. He held that
a requirement that the accused disprove the presumed fact on a balance of
probabilities did not shift the ultimate burden of proof onto the accused.

 

13.                                                                     Esson
J.A. in a short concurring judgment emphasized that the wording of s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  and s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
was substantially the same. He held that the lower courts should give the same
meaning to the Charter  provision as was established for its counterpart
in the Canadian Bill of Rights, unless the earlier decision was affected
by the statutory nature of the Canadian Bill of Rights. That, in his
view, was not the case in Appleby as this Court held that the phrase
""according to law"" in s. 2 (f) permitted statutory exceptions.








 

14.                                                                     In
his dissenting reasons, Hutcheon J.A. argued that the presumption of innocence
under the Charter  is different from that of the Canadian Bill of
Rights. He held that the phrase ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  should not be read as permitting statutory exceptions,
but that any such exceptions should have to be justified under s. 1  of the
Charter . Hutcheon J.A. agreed with the views expressed by Martin J.A. in
the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Oakes (1983), 145
D.L.R. (3d) 123, that the presumption of innocence requires that the Crown must
prove the accused's guilt and must do so beyond a reasonable doubt. If there is
a reasonable doubt yet the trial judge is required to convict, the presumption
of innocence is violated. Hutcheon J.A. concluded that s. 237(1) (a) did
infringe the presumption of innocence, but since s. 1  had not been argued, he
would have called for submissions on that point.

Presumption
of Innocence

 

A. Canadian
Bill of Rights

 

15.                                                                     As
I have indicated, the British Columbia courts placed heavy reliance on the
decision of this Court in Appleby, supra, which held that s.
237(1)(a) (then s. 224a(1)(a))
was not inconsistent with s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 








16.                                                                     The
first aspect of the Appleby decision continues to be relevant under the Charter ,
namely, the characterization of the legal effect of the presumption contained
in s. 224a(1) (a), now s.
237(1) (a). Ritchie J. concluded that the presumption places an onus on
the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he or she did not enter
the vehicle with the intention of setting it in motion. Since Laskin J. agreed
with Ritchie J. on this point, this Court was unanimous on the interpretation
of the provision.

 

17.                                                                     Ritchie
J. reached this conclusion for two reasons. The first of these was based on the
word ""establishes"" in the section. He held that as a matter of
statutory interpretation, the word ""establishes"" requires the accused
to prove the necessary fact on the balance of probabilities, and cannot be read
as equivalent to ""raises a reasonable doubt."" The meaning of the
words ""establishes"" and ""proves"" are well‑defined in
the criminal law. They require convincing proof, at least on the balance of
probabilities. This meaning of the words ""establishes"" and
""proves"" had been set out earlier in Latour v. The King,
[1951] S.C.R. 19, and Tupper v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 589. Pigeon J.
reaffirmed this meaning in the majority decision in R. v. Proudlock,
[1979] 1 S.C.R. 525.

 








18.                                                                     The
second reason given by Ritchie J. for concluding that the provision places an
onus of proof on the accused was that the section would otherwise be
meaningless. The presumption was included to allow the Crown to prove care or
control by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused occupied the
driver's seat. If the accused could rebut the presumption simply by raising a
reasonable doubt, then the Crown would be required to prove the fact of care or
control beyond a reasonable doubt, even though the statute deems that care or
control is shown upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused occupied
the driver's seat. This is exactly the same onus that the Crown would have to
satisfy if the presumption were not included in the section. To interpret the
section in this way would make the presumption ineffective and the section
meaningless.

 

19.                                                                     The
second aspect of Appleby was the contention that even though s. 237(1)(a)
created a reverse onus, it was not inconsistent with s. 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Writing for the majority on this point, Ritchie J. observed
that s. 2(f) gave statutory approval to the principle enunciated by
Viscount Sankey L.C. in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
[1935] A.C. 462, at p. 481:

 

Throughout
the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen,
that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to
what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to
any statutory exception. [Emphasis added by Ritchie J.]

 

20.                                                                     Ritchie
J. went on to hold as follows (at p. 316):

 

...the
words ``presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law . . ."" as they appear in s. 2(f) of the Bill
of Rights, must be taken to envisage a law which recognizes the existence
of statutory exceptions reversing the onus of proof with respect to one or more
ingredients of an offence in cases where certain specific facts have been
proved by the Crown in relation to such ingredients.

 








21.                                                                     In
my view, the reasoning of the Court in Appleby was manifestly influenced
by the limited extent to which the Court considered the Canadian Bill of
Rights could override otherwise valid legislation which conflicted with its
terms. The interpretation accorded to s. 2(f) effectively eliminated any
need to assess the validity of legislative derogation from the guarantee of the
presumption of innocence. It is clear from the case law that it is appropriate
for this Court to reassess the meaning of words borrowed in the Charter 
from the Canadian Bill of Rights: see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at pp. 333‑34, overruling Robertson and Rosetanni
v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 651, on the meaning of ""freedom of
religion""; R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, at pp. 639‑40,
overruling Chromiak v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 471, on the meaning of
""detention""; Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486,
departing from Duke v. The Queen, [1972] 2 S.C.R. 917, on the meaning of
""fundamental justice""; R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), [1987] 1
S.C.R. 1045, adopting the minority opinion in Miller and Cockriell v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, in preference to that of the majority.

 

22.                                                                     Although
the principles set out in the Canadian Bill of Rights are of great
importance (many of them having been re‑enacted in the Charter ), a
constitutional document is fundamentally different from a statute. The purpose
of the Charter  is to entrench certain basic rights and freedoms and
immunize them from legislative encroachments. Ordinary legislation must conform
to the constitutional requirements. An interpretation of s. 11 (d) that
would make the presumption of innocence subject to legislative exceptions would
run directly contrary to the overall purpose of an entrenched constitutional
document. Although the same important principle is involved, it is the nature
of the two documents which gives the presumption of innocence different effects
under the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Charter .

 

23.                                                                     I
conclude, therefore, that despite the holding in Appleby that s. 237(1)(a)
does not infringe the presumption of innocence, the question of the validity of
s. 237(1)(a) in the face of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is
still an open one.

 

B. 
General Charter Principles

 








24.                                                                     The
Supreme Court has considered the presumption of innocence guaranteed by the Charter 
in several recent cases: Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350; R.
v. Oakes, supra; R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, and
R. v. Holmes, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 914. These cases set out the basic
principles of the presumption of innocence and have started to explore its
application to particular statutory provisions. It is not necessary to review
these cases in depth; a brief summary will suffice.

 

25.                                                                     In
Oakes, the majority relied on the earlier decision in Dubois to
conclude that the presumption of innocence has at least three components.
First, an individual must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Second,
the Crown must bear the onus of proof. Third, criminal prosecutions must be
carried out in accordance with lawful procedures and principles of fairness (Oakes,
supra, at p. 121). As Lamer J. stated for the majority in Dubois,
the Crown must make out the case against the accused before he or she need
respond (Dubois, at p. 357). Applying these principles to a statutory
provision that required the accused to disprove an essential element of the
offence, the majority in Oakes held (at pp. 132‑33) that:

 

In general one must, I think, conclude
that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of
probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element
of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d).
If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to
occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. This would arise if the
accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or
her innocence but did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that
the presumed fact was untrue. [Emphasis added.]

 








26.                                                                     In
Vaillancourt Lamer J., for the majority on that point, again considered
s. 11 (d). He confirmed that the presumption of innocence requires that
the trier of fact be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of
all the essential elements of the offence. A provision that permits or requires
a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt as to the existence of one or more
of the elements of the offence violates the presumption of innocence. Lamer J.
recognized that Parliament can in some cases permit proof of a substituted fact
to be taken as proof of an essential element of the offence, but that there are
limitations on the scope of such substitutions (at p. 656):

 

Finally, the legislature, rather than
simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute
proof of a different element. In my view, this will be constitutionally valid
only if upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would
be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the existence of the essential element. If the trier of fact may have
a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of the substituted element, the substitution infringes ss. 7 
and 11 (d).

 

27.                                                                     The
next stage in the development of these principles occurred in Holmes,
which raised the question whether a requirement that the accused prove a lawful
excuse, rather than disprove an essential element of the offence, violated the
presumption of innocence. Two members of the Court held that a requirement of
this sort would offend s. 11 (d) (at p. 934):

 

Any
burden on an accused which has the effect of dictating a conviction despite the
presence of reasonable doubt, whether that burden relates to proof of an
essential element of the offence or some element extraneous to the offence but
nonetheless essential to verdict, contravenes s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
An accused must not be placed in the position of being required to do more than
raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt, regardless of whether that
doubt arises from uncertainty as to the sufficiency of Crown evidence
supporting the constituent elements of the offence or from uncertainty as to
criminal culpability in general.

 

C. Section
237(1)(a) and the Charter

 








28.                                                                     Is
section 237(1)(a) consistent with these principles? The basic fact which
the Crown must prove to invoke the section is that the accused occupied the seat
normally occupied by the driver of the motor vehicle. The presumed fact is that
the accused had the care or control of the vehicle. To rebut this presumption,
the accused must ""establish"" the absence of intention to set the
vehicle in motion. As I have already indicated, Appleby, supra,
and other decisions of this Court make it clear that the word
""establishes"" requires the accused to prove lack of intention on a
balance of probabilities.

 

29.                                                                     The
exact relationship between s. 237(1)(a) and the mens rea
requirement of s. 234  was the subject of uncertainty for some time. Is the
intention to set the vehicle in motion an ingredient of the offence of having
care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired, or is the absence of such
intention simply a way for an accused to rebut the presumption of care or
control? This Court settled the question in Ford v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 231, when Ritchie J. for the majority held that the intention to set the
vehicle in motion is not an element of the offence. Proof of lack of intention
is simply an evidentiary point that rebuts the presumption of care or control
of the vehicle established by s. 237(1)(a). The Court recently
reaffirmed Ford in R. v. Toews, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 119.

 

30.                                                                     In
the case at bar, the Attorney General of Canada argued that since the intention
to set the vehicle in motion is not an element of the offence, s. 237(1)(a)
does not infringe the presumption of innocence. Counsel relied on the passage
from Oakes quoted above, with its reference to an ""essential
element"", to support this argument. The accused here is required to
disprove a fact collateral to the substantive offence, unlike Oakes
where the accused was required to disprove an element of the offence.








 

31.                                                                     The
short answer to this argument is that the distinction between elements of the
offence and other aspects of the charge is irrelevant to the s. 11 (d)
inquiry. The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element
or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable
doubt exists. When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the
presumption of innocence.

 

32.                                                                     The
exact characterization of a factor as an essential element, a collateral
factor, an excuse, or a defence should not affect the analysis of the
presumption of innocence. It is the final effect of a provision on the verdict
that is decisive. If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance
of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of
innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the
mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused. The trial of an
accused in a criminal matter cannot be divided neatly into stages, with the
onus of proof on the accused at an intermediate stage and the ultimate onus on
the Crown. Section 237(1)(a) requires the accused to prove lack of
intent on a balance of probabilities. If an accused does not meet this
requirement the trier of fact is required by law to accept that the accused had
care or control and to convict. But of course it does not follow that the trier
of fact is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had care or
control of the vehicle. Indeed, in this case, as in Appleby, the trier
of fact stated that he convicted the accused despite the existence of a
reasonable doubt as to care or control, an element of the offence.

 








33.                                                                     In
the passage from Vaillancourt quoted earlier, Lamer J. recognized that
in some cases substituting proof of one element for proof of an essential
element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if, upon proof of the
substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.
This is another way of saying that a statutory presumption infringes the
presumption of innocence if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite
of a reasonable doubt. Only if the existence of the substituted fact leads
inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element exists, with no other
reasonable possibilities, will the statutory presumption be constitutionally
valid.

 

34.                                                                     The
presumption in s. 237(1)(a) does not have this inexorable character, as
the section itself recognizes. A person can be seated in the driver's seat
without an intention to assume care or control of the vehicle within the
meaning of s. 234 . Appleby provides an illustration: the accused in that
case explained that he sat in the driver's seat of a taxi to use the radio to
report an accident, and for no other purpose. The accused failed to convince
the trial judge on a balance of probabilities, but the judge admitted that he
had a reasonable doubt about the explanation. Other reasonable explanations for
sitting in the driver's seat can readily be imagined. It cannot be said that
proof of occupancy of the driver's seat leads inexorably to the conclusion that
the essential element of care or control exists, and therefore, s. 237(1)(a)
does not meet the test set out by Lamer J. in Vaillancourt.

 

35.                                                                     Section
237(1)(a) requires the trier of fact to accept as proven that an accused
had care or control of a vehicle, an essential element of the offence, in spite
of a reasonable doubt about the existence of that element. The section
therefore breaches the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11 (d)
of the Charter .

 

                                                                                                                                        IV








Section
1  of the Charter 

 

36.                                                                     The
respondent and the Attorney General of Canada argue that even if s. 237(1)(a)
infringes the presumption of innocence, the infringement is salvaged by s. 1  of
the Charter , which reads:

 

1. The Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only
to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in
a free and democratic society.

 

To
decide this point, it is necessary to apply the s. 1  analysis set out by the
majority in Oakes. There are two major criteria. First, the objective
which the measure responsible for the limit on a right or freedom is designed
to serve must be sufficiently important to permit overriding the
constitutionally‑protected right or freedom (Oakes, supra,
at p. 138). Second, to show that the measures are reasonable and demonstrably
justified requires an analysis of the proportionality of the measures (Oakes,
supra, at p. 139). There are three components to the proportionality test:
the measures must be carefully designed to achieve the objective of the
legislation, with a rational connection to the objective. The second component
is that the measure should impair the right or freedom as little as possible.
Finally, there must be proportionality between the effects of the impugned
measures on the protected right and the attainment of the objective.

 








37.                                                                     The
respondent Crown and the Attorney General of Canada argued strongly that the
objective of s. 237(1)(a) is sufficiently important to warrant
overriding a Charter  right. The section, along with the related sections
concerning the use, care or control of a motor vehicle while the ability to
drive is impaired by alcohol or while the proportion of alcohol in the blood
exceeds certain limits, is a response to a major social problem. Counsel for
the respondent submitted affidavit evidence outlining the number of people
charged annually with these offences, the number of fatalities and injuries
caused by impaired drivers, the number of accidents where alcohol is a factor,
and the cost to the public through insurance, hospital care, and the operation
of the justice system. Counsel for the Attorney General referred the Court to
the debates in the House of Commons when the predecessor of s. 237(1) (a)
was first introduced in 1947, and also to the debates on the 1985 amendments.
The Court was also referred to its own past decisions in Saunders v. The
Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 284, and Curr v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 889,
where the severity of the problems caused by impaired drivers was recognized.
Reference should also be made to the recent decisions of this Court in R. v.
Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621, and R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640.

 

38.                                                                     It
is not necessary to go into these submissions in detail, since the appellant
conceded that the objective of s. 237(1)(a) was sufficiently important
to warrant overriding a constitutionally‑protected right. He did note,
however, that s. 237(1)(a) is intended to assist the Crown to prove the
offence of care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired, where the risk is
that the occupant will put the vehicle in motion. The presumption does not
address the more prevalent problem of those who actually operate the vehicle
while their ability to do so is impaired.

 

39.                                                                     In
light of the submissions by the respondent and the Attorney General and the
concession by the appellant, I accept that there is a valid objective for s.
237(1)(a) and that the first criterion of the Oakes test is met.

 








40.                                                                     The
first component of the proportionality inquiry is the requirement that the
provision be carefully drawn and have a rational connection to the objective.
Section 237(1)(a) creates a presumption that a person in the driver's
seat of a vehicle has the care or control of the vehicle, one of the elements
of the offences under ss. 234  and 236 . In my view, there is plainly a rational
connection between the proved fact and the fact to be presumed. There is every
reason to believe the person in the driver's seat has the care or control of
the vehicle. The driver's seat is designed to give the occupant access to all
the controls of the car, to be able to operate it. It is true that a vehicle
can be occupied by one who does not assume care or control, but a person in
this state of mind is likely to assume a position in the vehicle intended for a
passenger rather than the driver. In my view, the relationship between the
proved fact and the presumed fact under s. 237(1)(a) is direct and self‑evident,
quite unlike that which confronted the Court in Oakes. Since section
237(1)(a) is intended to achieve the objective identified and is not
arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational considerations, it passes this stage
of the proportionality test.

 








41.                                                                     The
next stage of the proportionality inquiry is to ask whether the impugned
measure impairs the right or freedom as little as possible. With respect to s.
237(1)(a), this is the most crucial and difficult aspect of s. 1 
analysis. In my view, we must recognize that Parliament was faced with a
difficult task in defining drinking and driving offences. The very fact that
consumption of alcohol is an element of these offences renders problematic the
element of intention. Justice precludes undue reliance upon strict or absolute
liability. Social protection precludes undue emphasis upon the mental element
to these offences. Parliament has decided to define the offence in terms of
""care or control"". As I have already noted, this Court has held that
the Crown need not prove that the accused had an intention to drive or to set
the vehicle in motion in order to secure a conviction for ""care or
control"". The mens rea requirement for the offence of care or
control is a minimal one and it has not been argued here that this constitutes
a departure from the requirements of s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

42.                                                                     Criminal
legislation relating to the use of a motor vehicle while impaired dates back
some sixty‑seven years to An Act to amend the Criminal Code, S.C.
1921, c. 25, s. 3, which added s. 285c
to the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146. The new provision made it an
offence to drive a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Four years later,
Parliament amended s. 285c to make
it an offence to have care or control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated,
whether or not the vehicle was set in motion (An Act to amend the Criminal
Code, S.C. 1925, c. 38, s. 5). This provision was carried forward in the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as s. 285(4). It was repealed and re‑enacted
in substantially the same form by An Act to amend the Criminal Code,
S.C. 1930, c. 11, s. 6.

 

43.                                                                     The
addition of the care or control offence to the Code in 1925 caused some
uncertainty. Several judges commented that the phrase was unusually broad and
if taken literally could amount to criminal liability for the owner of a
vehicle who was intoxicated in his or her home with the car keys in his or her
pocket. The courts eventually concluded that the phrase had to be interpreted
more restrictively to mean a person who was in a position to be able to set the
vehicle in motion immediately. See R. v. Higgins, [1929] 1 D.L.R. 269
(Ont. S.C.); R. v. Butler, [1939] 4 D.L.R. 592 (Alta. S.C. App. Div.); R.
v. Crowe (1941), 16 M.P.R. 101 (N.S.S.C. in banco); R. v. Thomson,
[1941] 1 D.L.R. 516 (N.B.S.C. App. Div.); R. v. Forbes, [1943] O.W.N. 96
(Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Armstrong, [1944] 1 D.L.R. 233 (Ont. Co. Ct.), and
R. v. Hyatt, [1945] O.R. 629 (Ont. H.C.)








 

44.                                                                     The
fact that the accused was often highly intoxicated caused problems. In Butler,
supra, the accused was also found asleep and intoxicated behind the
steering wheel of a car. Harvey C.J.A. for the court held that intoxication
affects the ability of a person to have the care or control of a vehicle. Since
the accused was unconscious when found, he was incapable of exercising care or
control and was acquitted. Ford J.A. concurred in the result, but argued that
in some cases a person would be in care or control notwithstanding his helpless
position. In Forbes, supra, the accused was found slumped over the
steering wheel with the keys in the ignition. He testified that he had had no
intention of starting the car. The Ontario County Court allowed his appeal on
the grounds that since the accused did not have the physical or mental capacity
to put the car in motion, he did not have care or control. The judge recognized
that the result placed a premium on drunkenness, but felt compelled to acquit
as the evidence showed the accused was incapable of putting the car in motion.
Similarly, in Armstrong, supra, the Ontario County Court held
that the accused must be aware that he had the care or control of the vehicle.
Since the accused was in a drunken stupor in the driver's seat, the judge held
that there was a reasonable doubt whether the accused knew he had the care or
control of the vehicle. The accused was acquitted.

 








45.                                                                     Crowe
and Hyatt, supra, go to the opposite extreme. In both cases, the
accused were found slumped over the steering wheel, intoxicated, with the keys
in the ignition. The Ontario High Court and the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in
banco both found that the offence of care or control of a motor vehicle
while intoxicated was an absolute liability offence, designed to protect the
public from conduct that posed grave risks. Both courts relied on the absence
of the words ""wilfully"" or ""with intent"" in the wording of
the then s. 285(4) to conclude that there was no mental element at all. Guilt
followed on proof that the person was intoxicated and in a position to set the
vehicle in motion.

 

46.                                                                     In
1947, Parliament enacted the presumption now found as s. 237(1)(a), as a
proviso to s. 285(4). The purpose of the proviso was said at the time of its
introduction to be to clarify the content of the offence and to make it
difficult for an accused to avoid conviction for the care or control offence on
the ground that he or she was too impaired to assume control of the vehicle.
Our attention has been drawn to the exchange which took place between the
Minister of Justice and two members of the House of Commons during the debate
on second reading (Debates of the House of Commons, 3rd Sess., 20th
Parl., 1947, vol. VI, at p. 5048):

 

Mr. McMaster: Those words were not in the
old act. If he was in it, whether it was in motion or not, he was supposed to
be guilty of the offence.

 

Mr. Ilsley [Minister]: No, with deference,
I think the hon. member is wrong. Before this amendment, if his state of
intoxication were sufficiently advanced the courts in many of the provinces
held he did not have control of the motor vehicle. It is no longer open to an
accused person to defend himself on those grounds. The early words in this
proviso take that defence away from him. But they leave a defence to a person
who, having got into the car for the purpose of setting it in motion, goes to
sleep.

 

                                                                                                                                        ...

 








Mr. Miller: I return to the point I tried
to make a moment ago. It seems to me that a man who is drunk and stops his car
on the side of the road for the same purpose, namely to sleep it off, should be
in just as strong a position as the drunken man who got into the care, not
intending to start off with it. The other man got into the car with the
intention of driving it. He does drive it for a distance and finds he is
incapable of doing so. Therefore he wisely drives off to the side of the road.
I say he should be protected just as much as the drunken man who gets in but
does not start the car at all.

 

Mr. Ilsley: The hon. member's argument
leads to this conclusion, that we should not change the section at all. Perhaps
we should not. But certainly we have been severely criticized by the courts for
not changing it. There is a recent judgment of a judge in the supreme court of
New Brunswick which is most caustic in its reference to the lawmakers. The
reason is obvious.

 

If persons accused of driving a car while
intoxicated can go into a court and say, ""I was too drunk to be
guilty,"" it shocks the public; indeed it shocks us all, I believe.

 

47.                                                                     This
history shows that there is a serious problem with the mental element of this
offence, because the fact of intoxication itself raises doubts about the
accused's mental state and ability to form an intention. The presumption was
created by Parliament in response to that history. On the one hand, it was
repugnant to theories of criminal liability that a person could be convicted of
an absolute liability crime, with no possibility of a defence based on the
mental state of the accused. On the other hand, as the Minister of Justice
commented, it is shocking to hear that an accused could be acquitted of an
offence for which consumption of alcohol is a required element, because he was
too intoxicated to be guilty. The presumption was added to resolve the problems
caused by both of these alternatives. Parliament wished to discourage
intoxicated people from even placing themselves in a position where they could
set a vehicle in motion, while at the same time providing a way for a person to
avoid liability when there was a reason for entering the vehicle other than to
set it in motion. The position adopted is admittedly a compromise. It is an
attempt to balance the dangers posed by a person whose abilities to reason are
impaired by alcohol with the desire to avoid absolute liability offences. It is
an attempt by Parliament to recognize that alcohol, because of its effects on
the reasoning process, may in some cases require a special treatment, while
avoiding absolute liability offences.








 

48.                                                                     The
facts of the present case indicate that the problem identified by the Minister
of Justice in 1947 could well recur today, absent s. 237(1)(a). Although
the accused was found slumped over the steering wheel in a vehicle with the
lights on, keys in the ignition and engine warm, the trial judge found that in
the absence of the presumption, there would be a reasonable doubt as to guilt.

 

49.                                                                     In
my view, viewed in this context, s. 237(1)(a) represents a restrained
parliamentary response to a pressing social problem. It is important for the
purposes of the s. 1  analysis to view s. 237(1)(a) in the context of its
overall statutory setting. Parliament has attempted to strike a balance. On the
one hand, the Crown need only prove a minimal level of intent on account of the
fact that consumption of alcohol is itself an ingredient of the offence. On the
other hand, where an accused can show that he or she had some reason for
entering the vehicle and occupying the driver's seat other than to drive the
vehicle, the accused will escape conviction. Viewed in this light, s. 237(1)(a)
constitutes a minimal interference with the presumption of innocence guaranteed
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 








50.                                                                     The
final stage of the Oakes test is to ask whether there is proportionality
between the effects of the impugned measure and the objective being advanced.
In my view, s. 237(1)(a) satisfies this final element in s. 1  analysis.
The threat to public safety posed by drinking and driving has been established
by evidence in this case and recognized by this Court in others. While section
237(1)(a) does infringe the right guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
it does so in the context of a statutory setting which makes it impracticable
to require the Crown to prove an intention to drive. The reverse onus
provision, in effect, affords a defence to an accused which could not otherwise
be made available.

Conclusion

 

51.                                                                     It
follows, in my view, that the appeal should be dismissed and the constitutional
questions answered as follows:

 

Question
1:

 

1.         Does
section 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C‑34, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

Question
2:

 

2.         If
section 237(1)(a) of the Criminal Code  infringes or denies the
rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter , is
this section justified by s. 1  of the Charter  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

Appeal dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Break, enter and theft ‑‑ Recently stolen goods ‑‑
Conviction based solely on doctrine of recent possession ‑‑ Legal
significance to be attributed to possession of recently stolen property ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 306(1)(b).

 

                   Appellant
was charged with break, enter and theft under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code . His brother had admitted to committing the three burglaries in
question and the police had found items from the burgled houses in the house
appellant shared with his brother, some in his bedroom. On entering the house
with the police, appellant's brother shouted, ""They got us"";
appellant tried to leave by his bedroom window but was deterred by a police
officer stationed outside. Appellant was convicted on an application of the
doctrine of recent possession and the Court of Appeal upheld that conviction. At
issue here is the legal significance to be attributed to possession of recently
stolen property.

 

                   Held (Wilson J.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The doctrine of recent possession may be
succinctly stated. Upon proof of the unexplained possession of recently stolen
property, the trier of fact may‑‑but not must‑‑draw an
inference of guilt of theft or of offences incidental thereto. This inference
can be drawn even if there is no other evidence connecting the accused to the
more serious offence. Where the circumstances are such that a question could
arise as to whether the accused was a thief or merely a possessor, it will be
for the trier of fact upon a consideration of all the circumstances to decide
which, if either, inference should be drawn. The doctrine will not apply when
an explanation is offered which might reasonably be true even if the trier of
fact is not satisfied of its truth.

 

                   Per Wilson J.
(dissenting): Recent possession of stolen goods does not give rise to a legal
presumption of guilt of theft or of break, enter and theft. Rather it
constitutes a material fact from which an inference of guilt of theft can be
drawn. But the strength of the inference will depend on the surrounding
circumstances. If there is no other evidence connecting the accused to the
theft (as opposed to mere possession), then the offence of theft is not made
out against him. Recent possession does not allow a conviction for break, enter
and theft where it is ""quite impossible"" to determine whether the
accused committed theft or not. This conclusion is particularly compelling in
the Canadian context where there is an offence specifically covering simple
possession of stolen goods.

 

                   There
is no evidence here connecting the accused to the break, enter and theft other
than his possession of the stolen goods. This by itself cannot found a
conviction for the more serious offence.

delivered by

 

 

1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑I
have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared in this
appeal by my colleague, Justice Wilson. She has set out the facts and the
history of these proceedings in the courts of Manitoba and I need not make any
detailed reference to those matters. I would observe, however, that implicit in
the reasons of the trial judge is a finding of recency of possession which was
specifically supported in the Court of Appeal, and the appeal proceeded upon
that basis. I am unable, with the greatest deference to my colleague's views,
to agree with her conclusions or with her disposition of the appeal. The
principal point of disagreement arises from her words, at p. 86:

 

                   It would appear, therefore, that in both English and
Canadian law recent possession of stolen goods does not give rise to a legal
presumption of guilt of theft or of break, enter and theft. Rather it
constitutes a material fact from which an inference of guilt of the more
serious offence can be drawn. But the strength of the inference will depend on
the surrounding circumstances. This leaves open the issue as to whether such
an inference can be drawn when there is no other evidence connecting the
accused to the more serious offence. [Emphasis added]

 

It is in these last
words that my difference with her views is found, for it is my view, that in
both English and Canadian law the unexplained recent possession of stolen
property has long been sufficient to allow a permissive, not mandatory,
inference of guilt of both theft and offences incidental thereto, even in the
absence of other evidence of guilt.

 

2.                       The
roots of what has frequently been referred to as the doctrine of recent
possession go back at least to the early nineteenth century. In 1830, in Clement's
Case (1830), 1 Lewin 113, 168 E.R. 980, the rule was bluntly stated and it
was held that possession of a stolen horse three days after its theft was
sufficient evidence of stealing. Comments as to the need to show recency of
possession before an inference of guilt may be drawn were made in Cockin's
Case (1836), 2 Lewin 235, 168 E.R. 1139, and R. v. Hall (1845), 1
Cox C.C. 231. What has been noted by most writers as the most significant of
the earlier cases is R. v. Langmead (1864), Le. & Ca. 427, 169 E.R.
1459. The accused, Langmead, was charged with two counts: (1) theft of sheep,
and (2) feloniously receiving the sheep with knowledge that they had been
stolen. He was convicted of the second count. Counsel for Langmead, at p. 436
Le. & Ca., 1462 E.R., in arguing that there was no evidence to support a
conviction on the second count and that the jury should have been directed to
acquit upon that count, conceded that recent possession unaccounted for would
alone be sufficient for a conviction of theft, but it would not alone suffice
in considering the question of guilt on a charge of feloniously receiving the
sheep, knowing them to be stolen. This framed the issue in the case. The court
unanimously affirmed the conviction, holding that unexplained recent possession
was evidence either of theft or of feloniously receiving, depending on the
circumstances. Pollock C.B. said, at pp. 439‑40 Le. & Ca., 1463‑64
E.R.:

 

                   We are all satisfied that the Chairman could not
have withdrawn this case from the consideration of the jury, or have directed
them that there was no evidence that the prisoner had received the sheep
knowing them to have been stolen. Speaking for myself, I may add that, in my
opinion, the distinction taken by Mr. Carter between a charge of stealing and
one of receiving, with reference to the effect of evidence of recent
possession, is not the law of England. If no other person is involved in the
transaction forming the subject of the inquiry, and the whole of the case
against the prisoner is that he was found in the possession of the stolen
property, the evidence would, no doubt, point to a case of stealing rather than
a case of receiving; but in every case, except, indeed, where the possession is
so recent that it is impossible for any one else to have committed the theft,
it becomes a mere question for the jury whether the person found in possession
of the stolen property stole it himself or received it from some one else. If,
as I have said, there is no other evidence, the jury will probably consider
with reason that the prisoner stole the property; but, if there is other
evidence which is consistent either with his having stolen the property, or
with his having received it from some one else, it will be for the jury to say
which appears to them to be the more probable solution. In this case, although
there is some evidence that the prisoner stole the sheep, yet the inference
that he sent his boys to drive the sheep and to receive them from some one who
had stolen them in connection with him appears to me the more cogent. However
this may have been, we are all of opinion that there was evidence to go to the
jury.

 

Blackburn J. said, at
p. 441 Le. & Ca., 1464 E.R.:

 

                   I am of the same opinion. I do not agree with Mr.
Carter in thinking that recent possession is not as vehement evidence of
receiving as of stealing. When it has been shewn that property has been stolen,
and has been found recently after its loss in the possession of the prisoner,
he is called upon to account for having it, and, on his failing to do so, the
jury may very well infer that his possession was dishonest, and that he was
either the thief or the receiver according to the circumstances. If he had been
seen near the place where the property was kept before it was stolen, they may
fairly suppose that he was the thief. If other circumstances shew that it is
more probable that he was not the thief, the presumption would be that he was
the receiver. The jury should not convict the prisoner of receiving, unless
they are satisfied that he is not the actual thief.

 

It is clear, I would
suggest, that R. v. Langmead, supra, stands for the proposition
that the unexplained recent possession of stolen goods will permit an inference
of guilt on a charge of theft, or upon a charge of receiving, and it will be
for the jury or the trier of fact, on a consideration of all the circumstances,
to decide which of the two offences has been shown. This principle was applied
in R. v. Exall (1866), 4 F. & F. 922, 176 E.R. 850, a case which was
followed in this respect in Reference re Regina v. Coffin, [1956] S.C.R.
191, and R. v. Lovis; R. v. Moncini, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 294. In R.
v. Exall, articles stolen at night were found in possession of the accused
the following morning. Pollock C.B., at pp. 924‑28 F. & F., 851‑53
E.R., said:

 

                   The principle is this, that if a person is found in
possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no reasonable
account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that he committed the
robbery.

 

                   And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For,
if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the
person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence
that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other
crime.

 

                   The law is, that if, recently after the commission
of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person
is called up to account for the possession, that is, to give an explanation of
it, which is not unreasonable or improbable. The strength of the presumption,
which arises from such possession, is in proportion to the shortness of the
interval which has elapsed. If the interval has been only an hour or two, not
half a day, the presumption is so strong, that it almost amounts to proof;
because the reasonable inference is, that the person must have stolen the
property. In the ordinary affairs of life, it is not probable that the person
could have got possession of the property in any other way. And juries can only
judge of matters, with reference to their knowledge and experience of the
ordinary affairs of life.

 

                   Thus, for instance (to put the present case), if the
property were the produce of a burglary, then the possession of it, soon after
the burglary, is some evidence that the person in whose possession it is found
was a party to the burglary. For, at all events, he must have received it from
one who was a party to it; and this is strong evidence that he was privy to it,
and some evidence that he was a party to it. Whether or not he was so, must be
judged of from all the other circumstances of the case.

 

The most frequently
repeated statement of the English law on this question ‑‑which has
been specifically approved in this Court in such cases as Richler v. The
King, [1939] S.C.R. 101; Ungaro v. The King, [1950] S.C.R. 430; Tremblay
v. La Reine, [1969] S.C.R. 431; R. v. Graham, [1974] S.C.R. 206; R.
v. Newton, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 399; R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181; and
Hewson v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 82‑‑is that of Lord
Reading in R. v. Schama and Abramovitch (1914), 11 Cr. App. R. 45, at p.
49:

 

                   Where the prisoner is charged with receiving
recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the possession by the
prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the jury should be told
that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any reasonable
explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is given which may
be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is
guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably
be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is
entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus
of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the
prisoner's guilt. That onus never changes, it always rests on the
prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not pronouncing new law, but is
merely restating it, and it is hoped that this re‑statement may be of
assistance to those who preside at the trial of such cases.

 

A more recent case, R.
v. Aves, [1950] 2 All E.R. 330, in the English Court of Appeal, contains a
clear statement that recent unexplained possession alone may be sufficient to
raise a permissible inference of guilt. In that case, a conviction for
receiving stolen goods was appealed. The question was whether the jury had been
properly directed in accordance with the Schama and Abramovitch
direction. Lord Goddard C.J. said, at p. 330:

 

Where the only evidence is that an accused person is in possession of
property recently stolen, a jury may infer guilty knowledge (a) if he
offers no explanation to account for his possession, or (b) if the jury
are satisfied that the explanation he does offer is untrue. If, however, the
explanation offered is one which leaves the jury in doubt whether he knew the
property was stolen, they should be told that the case has not been proved,
and, therefore, the verdict should be Not Guilty.

 

                   I think I might add this as an addendum to the
formula above stated. If there is evidence that the prisoner was in possession
of property recently stolen and also other evidence which tends to show guilty
knowledge, then the judge should direct the jury in the terms which I have
mentioned on the question of recent possession, and should then go on to deal
with the other evidence against the prisoner which may or may not be consistent
with the explanation, if any, which he has given.

 

Later English cases,
such as R. v. Loughlin (1951), 35 Cr. App. R. 69 (C.A.), and R. v.
Smith (1983), 148 J.P. 215 (C.A.), are to the same effect.

 

3.                       The
more significant cases for our consideration here are those decided in this
Court which state the law as it is in Canada, and which are consistent with the
earlier cases that have developed the English law. Two of the leading cases
upon this question are R. v. Graham, supra, and R. v. Newton,
supra. Both of these cases dealt in great part with the question of
whether the Crown, before seeking to rely on recent possession, was under an
obligation to adduce evidence upon the question of whether the accused offered
an explanation for his possession. It was concluded in both cases that the
Crown bore no such obligation. This question does not arise here because it was
conceded that no explanation was offered. The appellant gave no evidence at his
trial and the recency of the possession and the knowledge that the goods were
stolen was not questioned in this Court. The sole question at issue here is
whether the inference which may be drawn from the unexplained recent possession
of the goods in question, standing alone, would support a conviction upon a
charge of breaking, entering and theft of those articles found in possession.

 

4.                       Before
going further, it will be worthwhile to recognize what is involved in the so‑called
doctrine of recent possession. It is difficult, indeed, to call it a doctrine
for nothing is taught, nor can it properly be said to refer to a presumption
arising from the unexplained possession of stolen property, since no necessary
conclusion arises from it. Laskin J. (as he then was) (Hall J. concurring) in a
concurring judgment in R. v. Graham, supra, said at p. 215:

 

                   The use of the term ""presumption"", which
has been associated with the doctrine, is too broad, and the word which
properly ought to be substituted is ""inference"". In brief, where
unexplained recent possession and that the goods were stolen are established by
the Crown in a prosecution for possessing stolen goods, it is proper to
instruct the jury or, if none, it is proper for the trial judge to proceed on
the footing that an inference of guilty knowledge, upon which, failing other
evidence to the contrary, a conviction can rest, may (but, not must) be drawn
against the accused.

 

He went on to point
out that two questions, that of recency of possession and that of the
contemporaneity of any explanation, must be disposed of before the inference
may properly be drawn. He made it clear that no adverse inference could be
drawn against an accused from the fact of possession alone unless it were
recent, and that if a pre‑trial explanation of such possession were given
by the accused and if it possessed that degree of contemporaneity making
evidence of it admissible, no adverse inference could be drawn on the basis of
the recent possession alone if the explanation were one which could reasonably
be true. Implicit in Laskin J.'s words that recent possession alone will not
justify an inference of guilt, where a contemporaneous explanation has been
offered, is the proposition that in the absence of such explanation recent
possession alone is quite sufficient to raise a factual inference of theft.

 

5.                       Four
years later, this Court decided the case of R. v. Newton, supra.
At issue in that case was whether a jury instruction with respect to the law of
recent possession with its allusion to unexplained possession would constitute
a comment on the failure of an accused to testify, contrary to s. 4(5) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. This contention was rejected and
that argument was not advanced in this Court. At pp. 401‑2, Dickson J.
(as he then was), with whom Laskin C.J. joined, in a judgment concurring in the
result, said:

 

                   The short question in this appeal is whether the
Crown is obliged to adduce evidence of any explanation given by the accused, or
absence of explanation, before relying on what has come to be called the
""doctrine of recent possession"". It has generally been understood
that all the Crown need establish in the first instance is that the goods were
recently stolen and that they were found in the possession of the accused. Then
the jury must be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the accused guilty. In the instant case, the trial
judge refused so to instruct the jury being of the view that it was incumbent
upon the Crown to adduce evidence as to whether or not the accused had offered
any explanation for his possession of the stolen goods. With respect, the judge
erred.

 

                   There is no duty upon the Crown to lead negative
evidence in these circumstances.

 

Of even greater
significance for the case at bar is the judgment of Ritchie J. (Martland and de
Grandpré JJ. concurring; Martland, Judson, Spence, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.
concurring in a separate judgment). He said that the proper instruction to a
jury in recent possession cases is that described by Lord Reading in R. v.
Schama and Abramovitch, supra, which, as has been noted, has been
approved in many judgments in this Court. He went on to say that evidence of
unexplained recent possession, standing alone, raises a prima facie case
upon which the trier of fact is entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty, on
the facts before him, of breaking, entering and theft. He said, at p. 405:

 

                   This statement has come to be referred to by text
writers and by many judges as the statement of a ""principle"" or a
""doctrine"", but I prefer to think of it in terms of a rule of
evidence as to which all judges should charge a jury. The rule has been
variously stated in different cases, but in my view the essence of the matter
is that in a case such as the present one where it has been established that
the accused was in possession of recently stolen goods and where no explanation
whatever has been advanced, the jury should be instructed that the evidence
of such possession standing alone raises a prima facie case upon which
they are entitled to bring in a verdict of guilty. [Emphasis added.]

 

While in R. v.
Newton, supra, the Court was not called upon to decide the issue of
whether recent possession by itself, in the absence of other circumstances
which would connect an accused to the theft, could justify a finding of guilt,
the words of Ritchie J. above would surely decide the present appeal in favour
of the Crown. This is particularly true when it is considered that no other
case in Canadian or English law suggests that some other evidence must be
present to connect an accused to the crime before an inference of guilt becomes
permissible. In my view, the authorities deny that any additional evidence,
apart from that of unexplained recent possession of stolen goods, is necessary
to permit an inference of guilt.

 

6.                       Two
recent appellate decisions are of interest. In R. v. Nickerson (1977),
37 C.C.C. (2d) 337 (N.S.C.A.), an accused charged with breaking and entering
and theft under s. 306(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34 was found in possession of cigarettes stolen from the trailer
which had been entered. He offered an explanation which was disbelieved by the
trial judge and he was convicted on the basis of the recent possession. His
appeal was dismissed. Macdonald J.A., giving judgment for the Court, after
commenting on certain authorities, said, at p. 343:

 

                   On the authority of the Langmead case it is,
in my opinion, initially for the jury, or for the trial Judge if there is no
jury, on an overview of all the circumstances to say whether the presumption
arising from the recent possession of stolen goods supports a charge of
stealing, robbery, break, enter and theft, etc., or only of possession of
stolen goods.

 

At page 344, he
recognized that the inference to be drawn from recent possession is only
permissive, saying:

 

                   Even when the presumption that arises from the
recent possession of stolen goods can be used the Crown is still left with the
ultimate or general burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The rule
being that a Court may not must convict in the absence of any
explanation.

 

and later,

 

                   By way of reiteration the principle that I glean
from the authorities to which I have referred is that unexplained possession of
recently stolen goods is evidence that may, depending on all the circumstances
of any given case, establish the commission of any offence by which such were
illegally obtained.

 

It is suggested that
the implication to be drawn from this case, stemming from the use by Macdonald
J.A. of the words, ""depending on all the circumstances of any given
case"", is that unexplained recent possession alone is insufficient to
support a guilty verdict. I would reject this view on the basis that it is
contrary to the authorities which I have considered. There must, of course, be
evidence that the goods were stolen and, where relevant, that a break‑in
occurred. There must also be evidence of possession, of recency of possession,
and evidence of the identity of the goods, all of which are present in the case
at bar. There may be, and frequently will be, other evidence which may be
relevant on the issue of guilt or innocence that must be considered by the
jury, but where the unexplained recent possession is found, it alone allows‑‑but
does not make mandatory‑‑a finding of guilt. In Russell v. R.
(1983), 32 C.R. (3d) 307, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal considered the
question of whether the application of the doctrine of recent possession
infringed the right to the presumption of innocence, under s. 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . This issue was not raised
in this Court. The case has relevance to this case, however, because of the
explanation of the nature of the inference given by Jones J.A., speaking for
the Court, after reviewing many of the authorities mentioned in this judgment,
he said, at p. 316:

 

These decisions make it abundantly clear that the inference arising
from the unexplained possession of stolen goods is simply one of fact and does
not alter the fundamental burden of proof on the Crown to establish guilt of
the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewed in that light the inference does
not offend the presumption of innocence under the Charter of Rights  and
Freedoms.

 

Of interest is an
annotation to this case by Don Stuart, appearing at p. 308 of the report.

 

7.                       On
the basis of the Canadian authorities referred to above, I am of the view that
it is clearly established in Canadian law that the unexplained recent
possession of stolen goods, standing alone, will permit the inference that the
possessor stole the goods. The inference is not mandatory; it may but need not
be drawn. Further, where an explanation is offered for such possession which could
reasonably be true, no inference of guilt on the basis of recent possession
alone may be drawn, even where the trier of fact is not satisfied of the truth
of the explanation. The burden of proof of guilt remains upon the Crown, and to
obtain a conviction in the face of such an explanation it must establish by
other evidence the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

8.                       The
question which arises here is whether the unexplained recent possession of
stolen goods, standing alone, will also warrant an inference of guilt of
breaking and entering and theft of the goods under s. 306(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code . It is my view that this question must be answered in favour of the
Crown. This point was reviewed in this Court in R. v. Lovis; R. v.
Moncini, supra. In that case, the accused were charged with two
offences: robbery, and possession of a stolen automobile. In the automobile at
the time of its theft were certain articles of personal property which were
found in the possession of the accused after the robbery had taken place and
the car had been used as the get‑away vehicle. Martland J.A., speaking
for a unanimous full Court, dealt with this question commencing at p. 303. He
quoted from Reference re Regina v. Coffin, supra, and, as well,
the words of Pollock C.B. in the early English case of R. v. Exall, supra,
at pp. 924‑27 F. & F., 851‑52 E.R., quoted above, which were
specifically approved in Coffin, supra, by Kellock, Rand and
Fauteux JJ., and supported by Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. in a separate
concurring judgment. Martland J. said, at p. 305:

 

                   In the light of these statements as to what may be
the effect of recent possession of stolen articles, not only in relation to a
theft of the articles themselves, but also in relation to the evidence as to
the commission of another crime, I do not think that it is a valid ground for
upsetting the jury verdict because the trial judge may have stressed the
requirements of s. 3(4) for establishing possession of the four articles to which
he referred. Here, as in the Coffin reference, a rule relating to
possession of certain articles is used to link the accused to pieces of
evidence in respect of a crime in which their possession is not, otherwise, a
material element.

 

In addition, see, as
well, R. v. Langmead, supra, and R. v. Nickerson, supra.

 

9.                       I
now turn to the case at bar. The trial judge was fully aware of the problem
before him. After some preliminary comments on the credibility of the
appellant's brother, he said:

 

                   Obviously, to make any conviction, I must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the evidence taken together. In
this case I think there's no dispute that it stands or falls on the application
of the Doctrine of Recent Possession, there being no direct evidence connecting
this accused to the break and entries in question.

 

He then proceeded to
make a finding of possession of the articles of property comprised in three of
the charges. He observed that there was more than one piece of property from
each of the houses in question found in the private locked room of the
appellant, that there was positive identification of the property, and that
some of the articles were in the same groupings or same containers as when
stolen. He considered, as well, the appellant's reaction and behaviour on the
arrival of the police, including his activity at the bedroom window, which he
considered he should not overweigh but should not ignore. He concluded by
saying:

 

                   I have considered the total absence of any kind of
reasonable explanation, and I have reached the conclusion that, with respect to
the 3 other charges, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of
the accused, and find that I can reach that conclusion without any concern in my
own mind that I am embarking on a dangerous course in so doing.

 

10.                     In
the Court of Appeal, Monnin C.J.M. and O'Sullivan J.A. agreed that the appeal
should be dismissed. Philp J.A. dissented (see (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 122, at
p. 123). Monnin C.J.M. in very short reasons expressed agreement with the trial
judge, saying:

 

I am satisfied that on the evidence on the record Kroft, J. reached the
proper conclusion and did not misdirect himself in any respect on any aspect of
the case.

 

O'Sullivan J.A. also
expressed agreement with Kroft J. in concluding his judgment in these words, at
p. 128:

 

In my opinion, Kroft, J., applied the doctrine of recent possession
realistically and accurately. While the time periods might be too long to
warrant the description of ""recent"" if the goods had come from one
house, the fact that goods were found from three houses all broken into as part
of a scheme, raises the same presumption in this case as if the possession had
been a matter of hours or days in another case.

 

Before reaching this
conclusion, however, O'Sullivan J.A. said, at p. 125:

 

In my opinion, the doctrine of recent possession is that, where the
doctrine applies, an accused may be found guilty of either theft or unlawful
possession, even though it remains quite impossible to say of which he is
guilty. The law is that where a jury is in no doubt that the accused is guilty
of one or the other of these offences, the jury may convict even though it has
reasonable doubt as to which to convict of.

 

11.                     While
I am in agreement with the result reached by the majority, I am unable to agree
with O'Sullivan J.A.'s statement of the doctrine of recent possession. In my
view, it is erroneous and based on a misunderstanding of some of the judgments
which he considered in reaching his conclusion. Where a jury is unsure as to
the guilt of an accused on one or other of two alternative offences, it cannot
be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on either offence and an acquittal will
result.

 

12.                     In
summary, then, it is my view, based on the cases, both English and Canadian,
which I have referred to, that what has been called the doctrine of recent
possession may be succinctly stated in the following terms. Upon proof of the
unexplained possession of recently stolen property, the trier of fact may‑‑but
not must‑‑draw an inference of guilt of theft or of offences
incidental thereto. Where the circumstances are such that a question could
arise as to whether the accused was a thief or merely a possessor, it will be
for the trier of fact upon a consideration of all the circumstances to decide
which, if either, inference should be drawn. In all recent possession cases the
inference of guilt is permissive, not mandatory, and when an explanation is
offered which might reasonably be true, even though the trier of fact is not
satisfied of its truth, the doctrine will not apply.

 

13.                     Upon
all the facts in this case it is my opinion, in agreement with that of Monnin
J.A., that the trial judge correctly applied the doctrine and I would dismiss
the appeal.

 

                          The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

14.                     Wilson J.
(dissenting)‑‑The issue in this appeal is whether it is open to a
trial judge to convict an accused of the offence of break, enter and theft
under s. 306(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34
when the only evidence connecting the accused to the offence is possession by
the accused of the recently stolen goods. In order to settle this issue the
Court must examine what has been referred to by some as the doctrine of recent
possession.

 

I The Facts

 

15.                     There
were three house break‑ins in Winnipeg during the summer of 1982 in each
of which the owners of the burgled houses had recently died and the burglaries
took place during the time of the pre‑advertised funeral service. The
break‑ins occurred on June 1, June 6‑8 and July 11, 1982.

 

16.                     On
August 27, 1982 Barry Kowlyk, the accused's brother, was arrested in the act of
committing a theft. During questioning by the investigating officers Barry
Kowlyk admitted that he committed the three break and enters in question. He
then led the officers to a house that he shared with the accused. Here the
officers found seventy‑six items stolen during the break and enters
described above. On entering the house with the police Barry Kowlyk yelled out
""Wake up Ray. The police are here. They got us. It's all over"".

 

17.                     The
accused was found in his bedroom. The door was closed and the police officer
demanded that the accused come out. The accused stated that he would do so
after he got dressed. Five minutes later the accused emerged from his bedroom.
A police officer who had been stationed outside testified that the accused had
opened the curtains, unlocked the window and attempted to lift the window, but
upon seeing the officer had stopped these activities. Fourteen of the stolen
items were found in the accused's bedroom. The items were grouped according to
the separate break‑ins.

 

18.                     The
accused was arrested and charged with three counts of break, enter and theft.
When questioned by the police about his involvement in the burglaries the
accused replied ""All you got me for is possession. I'm not saying anything"".
He made no further comment and did not testify at his trial. He was convicted
of all three counts of break, enter and theft by Kroft J. in the Manitoba Court
of Queen's Bench and was sentenced to thirty months' incarceration on each
count to be served concurrently. These convictions were upheld by the Manitoba
Court of Appeal (Philp J.A. dissenting): see (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 122.

 

II The Courts
Below

 

Court of Queen's Bench

 

19.                     Kroft
J. began by noting that no weight should be given to the evidence of Barry
Kowlyk, the accused's brother. He was simply not a credible witness. He noted
also that Barry Kowlyk was a thief and that he operated, at least on some
occasions, without his brother. Kroft J. made it clear that his approach to the
case was grounded in ""the doctrine of recent possession"". He stated:

 

In this case I think there's no dispute that it stands or falls on the
application of the Doctrine of Recent Possession, there being no direct
evidence connecting this accused to the break and entries in question.

 

In applying the
doctrine of recent possession the trial judge noted that significant quantities
of stolen goods were found in the accused's bedroom. He noted that the goods
found there were not isolated items but rather groups of objects from the same
houses. He also ""considered the accused's reaction on his arrest, his
comments and his activity at the window"". Finally, he considered ""the
total absence of any kind of reasonable explanation"" from the accused as
to how the stolen goods found their way into his bedroom.

 

20.                     For
these reasons Kroft J. convicted the accused of the three counts of break,
enter and theft.

 

Court of Appeal

 

21.                     The
Court of Appeal (Philp J.A. dissenting) dismissed the appeal. Monnin C.J.M., in
a short judgment, simply stated that he would uphold the trial decision for the
reasons given by the trial judge. O'Sullivan J.A. agreed with Monnin C.J.M.
that the appeal should be dismissed. He noted that it was admitted by both
sides that the accused was in possession of stolen property knowing that it was
stolen. He pointed out, however, that the accused was not charged with
possession but with break, enter and theft. Without the aid of the doctrine of
recent possession, O'Sullivan J.A. stated, the accused could not be convicted
of this offence. As O'Sullivan J.A. notes, at p. 124, ""it is quite
impossible to say in this case beyond doubt whether the accused was a thief or
only a possessor"".

 

22.                     O'Sullivan
J.A. concluded, however, that the accused was properly convicted of break,
enter and theft. He reached this conclusion by applying the doctrine of recent
possession. As O'Sullivan J.A. notes, at p. 125:

 

                   In my opinion, the doctrine of recent possession is
that, where the doctrine applies, an accused may be found guilty of either
theft or unlawful possession, even though it remains quite impossible to say of
which he is guilty. The law is that where a jury is in no doubt that the
accused is guilty of one or the other of these offences, the jury may convict
even though it has reasonable doubt as to which to convict of.

 

O'Sullivan J.A. cites
the old case of R. v. Langmead (1864), Le. & Ca. 427, 169 E.R. 1459,
9 Cox C.C. 464, (hereinafter cited to 9 Cox C.C.) as laying down
authoritatively that ""where unexplained recent possession exists, it is
sufficient to convict either of theft (or break and enter and theft) or of
unlawful possession even though it is quite impossible to say which crime it
was that was committed by the accused"".

 

23.                     Philp
J.A. dissented. He agreed that the ""so called `doctrine' or `principle' of
recent possession arises in the circumstances of this appeal"". He took
issue, however, with the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal as
to the effect of the doctrine. He reviewed the cases and texts and concluded
that the effect of the doctrine was well summed up in Phipson on Evidence,
13th ed., para. 4‑11, at p. 49, as follows:

 

                   For example, on charges of theft or handling, proof
of recent possession of the stolen property by the accused, if unexplained or
if, though explained the explanation is disbelieved, raises a presumption of
fact (not of law) that he is the thief or a handler (according to the circumstances)
and the jury may (though not must), providing they are satisfied that the other
elements of the particular offence are proved, convict. It is not for the
accused to prove honest dealing with the property, but for the prosecution to
prove the reverse. Thus if the explanation given is one which the jury think
may be true, though they are not convinced that it is, they must acquit, for
the burden of proof remains on the prosecution throughout and will not have
been discharged.

 

24.                     Applying
the doctrine to the facts of this case, Philp J.A. asked whether ""in all
of the circumstances it can be said beyond doubt that the accused committed the
much more serious offences of break, enter and theft, or aided or abetted in
their commission"". He answered this question in the negative stating, at
pp. l35‑36:

 

Apart from suspicion, conjecture and speculation (and the confession of
the brother, not evidence against the accused, implicating the accused), there
are no circumstances connecting the accused to the burglaries that had occurred
over two months prior to his arrest. He was not seen at or near the scenes.
Another person, the brother of the accused, has confessed his guilt and
testified that he was the sole participant in the offences. The trial judge
found the brother not to be a credible witness, but he also made the finding
that the brother had committed other offences without the participation of the
accused. The trial judge said:

 

""There is, however, some evidence respecting Barry Kowlyk that do
take as fact and that does bear to some extent on my decision. I find that he,
himself, was a thief, that he operated, at least on some occasions, without his
brother, and that he himself had taken stolen goods into his possession.""

 

I conclude that the trial judge, in applying the rule, did so on the
basis that the accused's unexplained possession of the stolen goods was prima
facie evidence of his participation in the three offences of break, enter and
theft. In my view, it was wrong to draw such an inference in the absence of any
evidence connecting the accused with the commission of those offences.

 

Because of my understanding of the effect and application of the rule
respecting possession of recently stolen goods, I feel bound to allow the
appeal of the accused and to acquit him. I must do so notwithstanding the fact
that the accused was undoubtedly guilty of (but not charged with) the offence
of possession of goods obtained by crime.

 

III The Issue

 

25.                     It
is clear that this appeal turns upon the legal significance to be attributed to
possession of recently stolen property. Recent possession has been called
variously a legal doctrine, a presumption, a legal principle, and a common
sense rule of evidence. Its roots are relatively ancient. It was relied on as
early as 1830 in Clement's Case (1830), 1 Lewin 113, 168 E.R. 980, where
Clement was convicted of horse stealing. The case report for Clement's Case
reads as follows:

 

                               Carlisle
Sp. Assizes, 1830.

                               Clement's Case.

                   (Possession
in Scotland evidence of stealing in England.)

 

                   Prisoner was indicted for horse‑stealing. The
evidence was, that he had the horse in his possession in Kirkcud­bright, three
days after it had been stolen, in the county of Cumberland.

 

                   Parke, J., held this to be sufficient evidence of a
stealing by the prisoner in Cumberland.

 

It is difficult to
assess the correct meaning to be attributed to this judgment. The paucity of
detail relating to the circumstances surrounding the case prevent one from
determining the exact use being made of the fact of recent possession. However,
if this case is authority for the proposition that recent possession in the
absence of any other incriminating circumstances can found a conviction for
theft, it has been eclipsed by later authority.

 

26.                     An
early example of this later authority is R. v. Hall (1845), 1 Cox C.C.
231. Here the evidence established that the prisoner had had access to the
premises of the prosecutor and that the prosecutor's shirt had been found in
the prisoner's possession. Pollock C.B. (Coleridge J. concurring) held that in
these circumstances the jury should be directed to acquit. Pollock C.B. stated:

 

                   It will be pushing the doctrine of possession rather
too far to hold this sufficient. There is a certain period, after which I
should think it very unfair to assume theft from mere possession, even where
the property is proved aliunde to have been stolen.

 

Thus, the mere fact of
possession of stolen goods can constitute proof of theft only when coupled with
surrounding circumstances such as a sufficient temporal connection between the
theft and the possession.

 

27.                     This
point was elaborated in Coleridge J.'s charge to the jury in Cockin's Case
(1836), 2 Lewin 235, 168 E.R. 1139. In this case the prisoner was indicted for
stealing two sacks. The evidence was that the sacks were stolen in February and
were found in the prisoner's possession in March, about twenty days later.
Coleridge J. charged the jury as follows:

 

                   If I was now to lose my watch, and in a few minutes
it was to be found on the person of one of you, it would afford the strongest
ground for presuming that you had stolen it; but if a month hence it were to be
found in your possession, the presumption of your having stolen it would be
greatly weakened, because stolen property usually passes through many hands.

 

This direction
underlines two important points. It indicates that recent possession is
strongly probative of theft only when the recency of the possession negates the
possibility that the property was stolen by a third party and transferred to
the defendant by the thief. More generally it emphasizes the need to look to
all the surrounding circumstances to determine the legal significance of the
fact of recent possession.

 

28.                     In
R. v. Langmead, supra, the need to examine recent possession in
the context of all the surrounding circumstances was stressed. Here Langmead
was convicted of feloniously receiving sheep that he knew were stolen. Langmead
argued that the jury should have been directed that they could not convict on
the felonious receiving count because, Langmead contended, the evidence proved
no more than unexplained recent possession of stolen sheep. The Court of
Criminal Appeal held that there was enough evidence to justify leaving the
question of guilt to the jury. The Court's comments on the implications of
recent possession of stolen goods are germane to the present discussion.

 

29.                     Pollock
C.B. characterized the fact that the accused was found in possession of very
recently stolen sheep as evidence of either theft or of receiving, depending on
the surrounding circumstances. Obviously some circumstances will rule out the
possibility of receiving. Pollock C.B. concluded, however, that that was not
the case here. He said at p. 468:

 

In the present case, I think that the evidence of receiving was more
cogent than that of stealing. It is very likely that the prisoner sent the two
boys to drive the sheep, and that they had innocently taken them from some one
else who had stolen them from the common.

 

Blackburn J. came to a
very similar conclusion in a brief judgment that is of central importance to an
understanding of the legal significance of recent possession. He said at p.
468:

 

                   I am of the same opinion. As a proposition of law,
there is no presumption that recent possession points more to stealing than
receiving. If a party is in possession of stolen property recently after the
stealing, it lies on him to account for his possession, and if he fails to
account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably presumed to have come by it
dishonestly; but it depends on the surrounding circumstances whether he is
guilty of receiving or stealing. Whenever the circumstances are such as render
it more likely that he did not steal the property, the presumption is that he
received it. In the present case, I believe that the jury have drawn the right
conclusion.

 

30.                     This
approach was endorsed in R. v. Exall (1866), 4 F. & F. 922, 176 E.R.
850. The facts of this case appear in the judgment as follows, at p. 922 F.
& F., 850 E.R.:

 

                   On the night of the 21st of December last, the
premises were broken open, and some time after eleven that night, the money and
articles mentioned stolen.

 

                   The prisoners were seen together on that night at a
public‑house not far off, and they were seen together early in the
morning.

 

                   In the morning, two of them, Edwards and Exall, were
apprehended together on suspicion; and on one of them, Exall, the watch was
found. The other prisoner, Skelton, was taken some time afterwards, and upon
him was found a piece of money, identified as part of the money stolen, and
which he said he had from Edwards, which Edwards did not deny.

 

Pollock C.B. had the
following comments to make to the jury on the nature of the law relating to
recent possession, at pp. 924‑28 F. & F., 851‑53 E.R.:

 

                   The principle is this, that if a person is found in
possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no reasonable
account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that he committed the
robbery.

 

                   And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson, or murder. For,
if the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the
person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence
that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other
crime.

 

                   The law is, that if, recently after the commission
of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods, that person
is called up to account for the possession, that is, to give an explanation of
it, which is not unreasonable or improbable. The strength of the presumption,
which arises from such possession, is in proportion to the shortness of the
interval which has elapsed. If the interval has been only an hour or two, not
half a day, the presumption is so strong, that it almost amounts to proof;
because the reasonable inference is, that the person must have stolen the
property. In the ordinary affairs of life, it is not probable that the person
could have got possession of the property in any other way. And juries can only
judge of matters, with reference to their knowledge and experience of the
ordinary affairs of life.

 

                   Thus, for instance (to put the present case), if the
property were the produce of a burglary, then the possession of it, soon after
the burglary, is some evidence that the person in whose possession it is found
was a party to the burglary. For, at all events, he must have received it
from one who was a party to it; and this is strong evidence that he was privy
to it, and some evidence that he was a party to it. Whether or not he was so,
must be judged of from all the other circumstances of the case. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Applying this approach
to the facts of the case, Pollock C.B. suggested, at p. 929 F. & F., 853
E.R., that the fact of recent possession should be considered simply as a piece
of circumstantial evidence to be considered along with all the other
circumstances:

 

                   It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to
be considered as a chain, and each piece of evidence as a link in the chain,
but that is not so, for then, if any one link broke, the chain would fall. It
is more like the case of a rope composed of several cords. One strand of the
cord might be insufficient to sustain the weight, but three stranded together
may be quite of sufficient strength.

 

                   Thus it may be in circumstantial evidence ‑‑
there may be a combination of circumstances, no one of which would raise a
reasonable conviction, or more than a mere suspicion; but the whole, taken
together, may create a strong conclusion of guilt, that is, with as much
certainty as human affairs can require or admit of.

 

On the whole the
judgment seems to permit a rather modest inference to be drawn from recent
possession of stolen goods. If the possession is so recent that it seems
improbable that the person could have got the property other than through
stealing it, the inference that the possessor is also the thief is strong. If,
however, there is no such close temporal nexus the inference is weak. In any
event, the fact of recent possession is merely one piece of evidence that must
be assessed together with all the other circumstances.

 

31.                     The
writers seem to agree that recent possession of stolen goods is best viewed as
a fact from which certain inferences can be drawn rather than as a legal
presumption or doctrine. As Delisle puts it in Evidence, Principles and Problems
(1984), at p. 79:

 

As the factual situation of theft and possession regularly occurred and
the practice of drawing the inference became standard, the courts, perhaps
unfortunately, began speaking of the ""presumption"" which arises from
the possession of recently stolen goods; from there it was a short step to talk
of the ""doctrine"" of recent possession. This is unfortunate as the
clothing of legal language often serves to distract from the simplicity and
common sense of the proposition and may place too heavy a burden on the accused.
[Emphasis added.]

 

A similar point is
made by McWilliams in Canadian Criminal Evidence, 2nd ed., (1984), where
he says of the doctrine of recent possession at pp. 81‑82: ""It is a
conclusion of fact invoked by common sense and not by any doctrine or
presumption"".

 

32.                     Wigmore
agrees. At page 417 of Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., vol. 9, (1940), the
author states that ""One of the most troublesome and fruitless
controversies has been whether under certain circumstances the accused's possession
of stolen goods raises a presumption that he was the thief"". After a
careful study of the English and American case law Wigmore concludes that the
best view is that no such presumption exists; ""...the suffi­ciency of the
evidence to go to the jury will usually depend on the variant circumstances of
each case"" (p. 422). Thus, the consensus of the writers seems to be that
recent possession of stolen property is a fact from which the inference of
theft may be drawn. The strength of this inference will depend on all the
surrounding circumstances of the particular case.

 

33.                     The
Canadian case law is largely in conformity with the position taken by the
English courts and the writers. The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently
taken the position that the legal significance of recent possession was
correctly stated by Lord Reading in R. v. Schama and Abramovitch (1914),
11 Cr. App. R. 45, at p. 49 (see Richler v. The King, [1939] S.C.R. 101;
Ungaro v. The King, [1950] S.C.R. 430; Graham v. The Queen,
[1959] S.C.R. 652; Tremblay v. La Reine, [1969] S.C.R. 431; R. v.
Graham, [1974] S.C.R. 206, and R. v. Newton, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 399).
In that case Lord Reading gave the following instruction to the jury:

 

                   ""Where the prisoner is charged with receiving
recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the possession by the
prisoner, and that the good had been recently stolen, the jury should be told
that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any reasonable
explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is given which
may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the
accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the
explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is
true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not
discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury
beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner's guilt. That onus never
changes, it always rests on the prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not
pronouncing new law, but is merely re‑ stating it, and it is hoped that
this restatement may be of assistance to those who preside at the trial of such
cases."" [Emphasis added.]

 

The fact that recent
possession entitles, but does not compel, a jury to find the accused guilty of
the offence charged is important. It makes it clear that the jury must consider
the fact of recent possession in conjunction with all the other relevant
circumstances. This conclusion is not surprising. Lord Reading was, after all,
simply re‑stating the existing English common law position.

 

34.                     It
would appear, therefore, that in both English and Canadian law recent
possession of stolen goods does not give rise to a legal presumption of guilt
of theft or of break, enter and theft. Rather it constitutes a material fact
from which an inference of guilt of the more serious offence can be drawn. But
the strength of the inference will depend on the surrounding circumstances.
This leaves open the issue as to whether such an inference can be drawn when
there is no other evidence connecting the accused to the more serious offence.

 

35.                     The
difficulty in resolving this issue flows from the fact that the typical case in
which recent possession is invoked usually involves other evidence connecting
the accused to the offence charged. Indeed, the annotation to Exall, supra,
suggests ""The question never did and never could arise in a dry abstract
form, and there are always circumstances to aid or rebut the presumption
arising from possession"" (p. 925 F. & F., 852 E.R.) It is certainly
true that it will be rare for the question to arise in the ""abstract
form"". As we have already seen, the temporal connection between the
possession and the theft often constitutes an additional fact supporting the
inference that the possessor was also the thief. Assuming, however, that the only
evidence connecting the accused to the theft was his possession of the stolen
goods, would this be sufficient to justify his conviction of theft?

 

36.                     Some
support for the position that the accused cannot be convicted of theft in these
circumstances can be draw from the early cases examined above. As Blackburn J.
concluded in Langmead, supra, recent possession of stolen goods
provides evidence that the accused has ""come by [the property]
dishonestly...but it depends on the surrounding circumstances whether he is
guilty of receiving or stealing"". It would seem to follow from this that,
if there are no further circumstances connecting the accused to the theft, then
this offence is not made out against him. This conclusion seems particularly
compelling in the Canadian context where there is an offence specifically
covering simple possession of stolen goods.

 

37.                     This
conclusion is bolstered by dicta in R. v. Nickerson (1977), 37 C.C.C.
(2d) 337 (N.S.C.A.) Here Macdonald J.A. explained the effect of the doctrine of
recent possession at p. 343 as follows:

 

                   On the authority of the Langmead case it is,
in my opinion, initially for the jury, or for the trial Judge if there is no
jury, on an overview of all the circumstances to say whether the presumption
arising from the recent possession of stolen goods supports a charge of
stealing, robbery, break, enter and theft, etc., or only of possession of
stolen goods.

 

The implication here
is that recent possession alone is not enough to sustain a guilty verdict of
the more serious offence; it only becomes sufficient when combined with
inculpating surrounding circumstances.

 

38.                     Nickerson
itself was not a case, however, where the fact of recent possession of
stolen goods alone was being relied on to found a conviction of break, enter
and theft. The facts of the case are stated in the judgment as follows, at p.
344:

 

                   In the present case there is no question that a
trailer parked on the lot of Eastern Transport Limited was broken into some
time between 11:40 p.m., on May 24, 1977, and 12:15 a.m., on May 25, 1977, and
four cartons of cigarettes stolen therefrom. Likewise there is no question that
the appellant was found in possession of one of such cartons ""on the early
morning of May 25th"" at a location approximately one to one and one‑half
miles from the location of the trailer. Constable Gunn of the Halifax City
Police Force, who apprehended the appellant, testified that he had observed the
appellant carrying the carton of cigarettes on his shoulder,
that: . . .

 

Thus, the accused came
very close to being caught red‑handed. He was close to the scene of the
break and enter both in time and place and he had a carton of the stolen
cigarettes on his shoulder. Accordingly, although the fact of recent possession
of stolen goods would not by itself have justified a conviction of break, enter
and theft, it did justify a conviction when coupled with the surrounding
circumstances.

 

39.                     This
approach seems to be in accordance with the case law and with the structure of
the Criminal Code  provisions relating to theft. The fact of recent
possession of stolen goods may, when coupled with other inculpating
circumstances, justify convicting the possessor of the offence by which the
goods were illegally obtained. Absent these additional inculpating
circumstances, only a conviction for possession of stolen goods (s. 312  of the Criminal
Code ) is justified.

 

IV Applying
the Rule

 

40.                     In
the present case the trial judge stated that, absent the doctrine of recent
possession, he would not have been able to convict the accused of break, enter
and theft. By an application of the doctrine, however, the trial judge found
that he was able to convict Kowlyk of break, enter and theft despite the fact
that there was no evidence to indicate whether the accused had committed that
offence or whether he had merely committed the offence of possession.

 

41.                     The
majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal upheld Kowlyk's conviction. Monnin
C.J.M. simply stated that he was satisfied that the trial judge ""reached
the proper conclusion and did not misdirect himself in any respect on any
aspect of the case"". O'Sullivan J.A. also believed that the appeal should
be dismissed. He held explicitly that the conviction was only possible because
of the doctrine of recent possession, stating at pp. 124‑25:

 

I think it is quite impossible to say in this case beyond doubt
whether the accused was a thief or only a possessor.

 

                                                                    ...

 

In my opinion, the doctrine of recent possession is that, where the
doctrine applies, an accused may be found guilty of either theft or unlawful
possession, even though it remains quite impossible to say of which he is
guilty. The law is that where a jury is in no doubt that the accused is guilty
of one or the other of these offences, the jury may convict even though it has
reasonable doubt as to which to convict of. [Emphasis added.]

 

This characterization
of the doctrine of recent possession, explicit in O'Sullivan J.A.'s judgment
and implicit in those of the trial judge and of Monnin C.J.M., constitutes
reversible error.

 

42.                     The
case law indicates that the fact of recent possession entitles a jury to enter
a verdict of guilty of the offence of break, enter and theft if the
circumstances of the case establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The cases
do not stand for the proposition that the fact of recent possession allows a
conviction for break, enter and theft where it is ""quite impossible""
(to use the words of O'Sullivan J.A.) to determine whether the accused
committed the offence or not.

 

V Conclusion

 

43.                     In
the present appeal there is no evidence connecting the accused to the break,
enter and theft other than his possession of the stolen goods. This by itself
cannot found a conviction for the more serious offence. I would therefore allow
the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and quash the
accused's conviction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Wiretaps ‑‑ Admissibility of evidence ‑‑
Sufficiency of authorization ‑‑ Whether authorization must
specifically identify motor vehicle as place of interception ‑‑
Collateral attack on order authorizing wiretap ‑‑ Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 178.13(2)(c).

 

                   Evidence
‑‑ Admissibility ‑‑ Wiretap evidence ‑‑
Sufficiency of authorization ‑‑ Whether authorization must
specifically identify motor vehicle as place of interception.

 

                   The
Crown's case against appellants depended upon wiretap evidence and certain
derivative evidence. Interceptions were made in motor vehicles, and although
the police knew they intended to make these interceptions when the applications
for the authorizations were made, these locations were not specifically
included in the locations described in the judicial authorizations. The trial
judge on a voir dire held that the motor vehicles should have been
described in the judicial authorizations and excluded the evidence. The Court
of Appeal considered this holding to be a collateral attack upon the order of a
judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario and allowed the Crown's appeal. Three sub‑issues
rose out of the central issue of whether the interceptions in the motor
vehicles were made in accordance with an authorization: (1) whether a motor
vehicle is a ""place"" within the meaning of s. 178.13(2) (c) of
the Criminal Code ; (2) whether compliance with this section requires
that a ""place"" known to be a target of the wiretap be expressly
specified in the authorization; and (3) whether the trial judge's ruling
constituted a collateral attack on the authorizations and whether his reliance
on the Crown's concession that the motor vehicles were a known target prior to
authorization constituted ""going behind"" the authorizations.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Per McIntyre, Lamer
and Wilson JJ.: The interceptions in the motor vehicles were made in accordance
with the authorizations. A motor vehicle is or may be a ""place""
within the meaning of s. 178.13(2) (c) of the Criminal Code . That
word, when used without specific definition, should be given a meaning
consistent with the scope and nature of the offence to which it relates. The
requirement of s. 178.13(2) (c) that the authorization describe the place
of interception was met by paragraphs 4 and 5 of the authorizations. The motor
vehicles of the two appellants, who were specifically named in the
authorizations, were consequently covered by the authorizations. The
interceptions, therefore, were lawful under Part IV.1 of the Code and
admissible in evidence. It was unnecessary to deal with whether the
authorizations should have gone further and described the automobiles which
were the targets of the interception. That argument was a collateral attack
upon the authorizations and not available to the appellants.

 

                   Per La Forest J.: The
appeal should be dismissed solely on the basis that the judge's manner of
dealing with the authorization constituted a collateral attack upon the
authorization.

                   The
judgment of McIntyre, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal comes to the Court as of right, pursuant to the provisions of s. 618(2)(a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. The appellants with
two others were indicted and tried in the County Court by judge alone on an
indictment which alleged a conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada. It
was in the following terms:

 

That they, between June 1, 1979 and November 30, 1979 at the City of
Hamilton in the Judicial District of Hamilton‑Wentworth and elsewhere in
the Province of Ontario unlawfully did conspire together, each with one or more
of the others and with Antoinette Pugliese and other persons at present
unknown, to, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defraud the
Government of Canada and the Canadian Home Insulation Programme, of money or
funds in the bank having a value exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00),
contrary to Section 338(1) (a) and 423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

The Crown's case
depended upon a series of electronically intercepted private communications
made in Hamilton and Burlington and, in addition, the Crown sought to introduce
certain derivative evidence obtained as a result of the interceptions. All the
interceptions were made under the authority of two judicial authorizations, one
given by Saunders J., of the Ontario Supreme Court, on June 21, 1979 (renewed
on August 17, 1979 by Blair Co. Ct. J.), and the second authorization was
granted by Blair Co. Ct. J. on October 18, 1979. Only two paragraphs from the
authorizations come under consideration in this appeal. Clause 4, appearing in
each, provided that the private communications of each of the appellants could
be intercepted:

 

                   4. ...

 

(a)               By the use of audio transmitter
and receiver, an electromagnetic, acoustic device sometimes referred to as a
microphone and amplifier installed at or near the addresses described in
paragraph five (5) of the Authorization, or at or near such further other
locations, both stationary or mobile, for which there are reasonable and
probable grounds to believe such locations may be used by any person or persons
described in paragraph three (3) of this Authorization for the purpose of
carrying out private communications for the purposes as specified in paragraph
one (1) of this Authorization . . . .

 

Clause 5 of each
specified various addresses at which interceptions could be made and then
provided that, in addition, interceptions could be made:

 

                   5. ...

 

(n)               . . . at or near
such further other locations for which there are reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that the persons described in paragraph three (3) of this
Authorization may carry on private communications in respect of the offences as
set out in paragraph one (1) of this Authorization.

 

2.                       Certain
of the interceptions were made in the automobiles of Papalia and Monaco in
which the police had surreptitiously placed listening devices. It was conceded
that at the date of the application for the first judicial authorization the
police were aware of the existence of the automobiles, having made observations
of Papalia and Monaco conversing in them. It was conceded as well that the
police at that time intended to intercept communications made in the vehicles.
The vehicles were not, however, specifically identified in the authorizations
as places of interception. Other interceptions were made in the board room and
office of a business located at 20 Railway Street in Hamilton. The police
entered these premises surreptitiously and installed a telephone tap and room
listening devices.

 

3.                       In
a voir dire held by the trial judge to decide on the admissibility of
the interceptions, the appellants raised two arguments. First, they submitted
that with the exception of the telephone interceptions, all the interceptions
were unlawful because they had been obtained by unlawful trespass by the police
on private property. This argument was rejected in the courts below, and has
now been settled by the decisions of this Court in Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, and the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697. The
second argument was that the evidence obtained by the installation of the
listening devices in the appellants' automobiles was inadmissible because,
while the police knew of the vehicles as intended places of interception before
they applied for the authorization, the vehicles were not specifically
identified. This, it was contended, is required by s. 178.13(2)(c) of
the Code which provides that an authorization shall:

 

                   178.13 ...

 

                   (2) ...

 

(c)               state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted, generally
describe the place at which private communications may be intercepted, if a
general description of that place can be given, and generally describe the
manner of interception that may be used; [Emphasis added.]

 

The trial judge gave
effect to this argument. He found that the automobiles in question were private
places within the meaning of Part IV.1 of the Code. Since the police had
intended to install listening devices in them for the purpose of intercepting
private communications from the outset, they should have been specifically
identified in the authorizations as places of interception in accordance with
s. 178.13(2) (c). In the absence of a general description of the
automobiles in the authorizations, which could have been given by reference to
licence numbers or vehicle make, it could not be held that the motor vehicles
were covered. He therefore excluded the evidence of the interceptions and
certain derivative evidence obtained as a result. The remaining Crown evidence
was not considered sufficient to support a conviction and the appellants were
acquitted.

 

4.                       The
Crown's appeal was allowed. Brooke J.A., writing for a unanimous court (Brooke,
Arnup and Blair JJ.A.), considered that the trial judge's holding that the motor
vehicles should have been specifically mentioned in the authorizations amounted
to a collateral attack upon the order of a judge of the Supreme Court of
Ontario. In this, he relied on Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594,
a judgment of this Court rendered after the ruling at trial. Brooke J.A. said
that the trial judge was bound to accept the validity of the authorization. To
inquire into whether or not the vehicles should have been specified in the
authorization as ""known places"" at the date of the application for
authorization was to go behind the authorization. It should have been taken at
face value. This would have led to the conclusion that clauses 4 and 5 were
sufficient to authorize the installation of the listening devices and the
interceptions in the two vehicles.

 

5.                       In
this Court the appellants framed the issues arising in these terms. They said
the central issue to be determined is whether the interceptions in the
automobiles were made in accordance with an authorization, the terms of which
comply with Part IV.1 of the Code. They said that three sub‑issues
arose and they set them out in their factum in the following manner:

 

1. Were the automobiles `places' within the meaning of Section
178.13(2) (c) of the Criminal Code ?

 

2. Does compliance with Section 178.13(2) (c) require that a
`place' known to be a target of the interception prior to the authorization be
expressly specified as a `place' in the authorization?

 

3. Did the ruling of the learned Trial Judge that a `place' known
to be a target of interception must be expressly specified in the authorization
constitute a collateral attack on the authorization to intercept the
Appellant's private communications or did the learned Trial Judge's reliance
upon the concession of Crown counsel that the automobiles were a known target
of interception prior to the authorization constitute `going behind' the
authorization?

 

In respect of the
first two issues, it was argued that automobiles are ""places"" within
the meaning of that expression in s. 178.13(2)(c) of the Code
and, therefore, the automobiles in this case should have been named and
described, if only by a vehicle name or licence number in the authorization.
The third point concerned the question of whether the trial judge, in
concluding that a place known to be a target for interception ought to have
been included in the authorization, made a collateral attack on the
authorization an order of the Supreme Court of Ontario.

 

6.                       The
Crown concedes that an automobile is or may be a ""place"" within the
meaning of s. 178.13(2)(c) of the Code. This, in my view, was a
concession properly made. An automobile, under the clear wording of s.
178.13(2) (c), may be a place at which private communications may be
intercepted. As pointed out by the appellants, the word ""place"" is
defined in various sections of the Code in narrow and specific terms. For
example, s. 179(1) of the Code defines common bawdy‑houses, common
betting houses, common gaming houses, and disorderly houses in narrow and
specific terms. The same is true of s. 306(4) which defines ""place""
for the purpose of ss. 306 and 309 in similar narrow terms. It is evident,
however, that in employing such limited definitions the Code has done so
to suit the circumstances and conditions of certain offences. Therefore, when
the word is used without specific definition, it would be reasonable to give it
a meaning consistent with the scope and nature of the offence to which it
relates. In R. v. Saunders (1906), 12 O.L.R. 615 (C.A.), affirmed in
this Court (1907), 38 S.C.R. 382, where an accused was charged with keeping a
common betting house because of his operation of a mobile betting booth at a
race track, Moss C.J.O. said, at p. 619:

 

                   The Courts have declined to define a place in
general terms ‑‑ but they recognize the principle that
""place"" must be in some sense fixed and ascertained, and the inquiry
is whether the facts of the particular case shew that the person charged was
making such use of a house, office, room or other place, in which he was
operating, as to bring him within the Act.

 

And see, as well, R.
v. Thompson (1920), 48 O.L.R. 163, where an accused was charged with
keeping a disorderly house or a place for prostitution. The accused was a taxi
driver and permitted the use of his taxi for this purpose. In his defence it
was argued that an automobile was not a place, as defined in s. 225 of the Code
as it then stood, and that a place must have some fixed character as concerns
its immediate surroundings. Orde J. referred to the Saunders Case and,
at p. 167, said:

 

The fact that the car is moved from spot to spot makes no difference,
in my opinion. The prisoner was allowing his car to be used by prostitutes for
the purposes of prostitution. There was a localization of the acts within the
confines of the car, and, in my opinion, it then became the `place' where the
acts of prostitution took place. The analogy between this case and the case of
the moveable booth in the Saunders case is complete.

 

I would also observe
that this Court in Hutt v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 476, considered
that an automobile could be a place. I would say, therefore, that an automobile
may clearly be a place for the purpose of s. 178.13(2)(c) of the Code.
Indeed, it must be observed that this proposition has been accepted, seemingly
without question, from the very early days of the present Part IV.1 of the Code.
Automobiles have been frequent targets of interception. The real question upon
which the parties are divided is whether a vehicle known by the police to be a
target for interception at, or prior to, the time of application for an
authorization must be expressly stated as a place in the authorization. In the
authorization with which we are concerned, the appellants, Papalia and Monaco,
are both named as targets for interception. The automobiles were not
specifically named. Section 178.13(2) (c) provides that an authorization
shall:

 

                   178.13 ...

 

                   (2) ...

 

(c)               state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted,
generally describe the place at which private communications may be
intercepted, if a general description of that place can be given, and generally
describe the manner of interception that may be used;

 

To satisfy the
requirement that the authorization must ""generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted, if a general description of
that place can be given"", the Crown must rely on the passages from the
authorizations extracted, supra, clauses 4 and 5 of each order.

 

7.                       The
appellants say that the automobiles were both known to the police at the time
of the application for the authorization and that they were at that time
intended as targets for interception. They should have been specifically named.
This could readily have been done, they argued, by reference to the licence
numbers or to the makes and models or year of manufacture of the vehicles. They
invoke the principle stated in such cases as R. v. Crease (No. 2)
(1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 378 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Blacquiere (1980), 57
C.C.C. (2d) 330; R. v. Cardoza (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 412, that where s.
178.13(2) (c) requires that an authorization state the identity of
persons, if known, failure to name a known person will render the interception
of his private communications inadmissible. This proposition by analogy, it is
argued, applies where known locations are not specified.

 

8.                       The
Crown's position is simply stated. It argues that the evidence from the
interceptions made in the cars is admissible because it was obtained in
accordance with a valid judicial authorization. Section 178.13(2) (c)
requires that the authorization generally describe the locations or places of
interception. This was done in the case at bar and paragraphs 4 and 5,
reproduced above, give an adequate general description of the places of
interception. The Crown relies on this point on R. v. Musitano (1985),
24 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Ont. C.A.) This case involved several other issues, but in
the judgment of the court (Brooke, Lacourcière and Robins JJ.A.), at pp. 69‑70,
facts somewhat similar to the case at bar were considered. An authorization had
been given which gave wide powers of interception in a basket clause and, in
addition, authorized interception of ""Any motor vehicle used by any of the
persons set out in paragraph 5 at any location"", and then provided
further:

 

5. (b) and at or near such further or other locations both
stationary and mobile for which there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe the persons described in paragraph three (3) of this Authorization may
carry on private communications in relation to the offences specified in
paragraph one (1) of this Authorization.

 

Dealing with the
question of interceptions made in the automobile of one Wala, held to be
covered as a target for interception under the basket clause, the Court said,
at p. 70:

 

                   The appellants Wala and Cummings submit that the
interception of their private communication in her automobile is not
admissible, as it was unlawful, because that location was not authorized. They
submit that at the time the application for the authorization was made, the
police knew the licence number and particulars of her automobile. It ought,
therefore, to have been included as a designated specific location at which the
interception of private communications might be made. We do not agree that this
was necessary or that the absence of the particulars in the circumstances was
fatal to the lawfulness of the interception. The authorization was clear and
sufficient and the automobile in question fell within the description therein.
In the result, there was no improper delegation to the police of the power to
select whose communications should be intercepted or where the interception
should be made as in R. v. Paterson, Ackworth and Kovach (1985), 18
C.C.C. (3d) 137, 44 C.R. (3d) 150 (Ont. C.A.). We agree with the trial judge
that the interceptions in question were lawfully made and admissible.

 

9.                       I
consider that this statement is equally applicable to the case at bar and, in
fact, decisive in favour of the Crown's position. The cars of the two
appellants who were specifically named in the authorizations were covered, in
my view, by clauses 4 and 5 of the authorizations, and the interceptions were,
therefore, lawful under Part IV.1 of the Code and admissible in
evidence.

 

10.                     It
is my view that it is unnecessary to deal with the argument that the
authorization should have gone further and described the automobiles which were
the targets of the interception. In that respect I am in agreement with Brooke
J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he categorizes that argument as a collateral
attack upon the authorization and in accordance with Wilson v. The Queen,
supra, it is not available to the appellants. I would dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellants,
V and C, were jointly charged along with several others with conspiracy to
commit robbery and kidnapping. The Crown's case was largely dependent on
certain private communications of the appellants which were intercepted under a
judicial authorization while the police were investigating certain individuals
concerning offences not connected with the present case. The authorization
permitted the police to intercept private communications of four named
individuals, including W, V's boy friend, as well as those of unknown persons.
Neither of the appellants was named in the authorization. During the
investigation, evidence revealed that W, the two appellants and two other
individuals had revived a plan to rob a supermarket by kidnapping the cashier
and forcing her to open the safe. Acting under the authorization granted earlier,
the police were able to place surreptitiously a short‑range listening
device in W's motor vehicle. The device was wired to the vehicle's battery
which provided power for its transmitter. It was not disputed that in this case
the device caused no injury to either vehicle or battery. On a voir dire,
the trial judge held that the intercepted communications of the appellants were
all unlawful under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , and excluded them
from evidence. As a result, he acquitted both appellants. On appeal, the Court
of Appeal overturned the acquittals and ordered a new trial. This appeal is to
determine (1) whether the surreptitious installation in a motor vehicle by
police of a listening device, connected to the battery of the vehicle,
constitutes an unlawful interception; (2) whether V is a person whose private
communications were within the contemplation of the authorization; and (3)
whether her private communications were admissible in view of the fact that
they were made to persons whose communications were lawfully intercepted under
the authorization.

 

                   Held: V's
appeal should be allowed and C's appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Beetz,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: A covert or a surreptitious entry into private property
for the purpose of installing an authorized listening device as an incident to
the execution of a valid authorization is a power contemplated ""by
necessary implication and unavoidable inference"" in Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code . Therefore, despite the fact that the entry might otherwise amount to
unlawful conduct, the interception would be lawful under s. 178.16(1)(a)
of the Code as having been authorized by Parliament. If the interception
conforms with the authorization and it is carried out within the powers given
in Part IV.1, the interception has been lawfully made. Here, appellants'
contention that the use of a device connected to and draining the vehicle's
battery was unlawful and unauthorized must be rejected. Devices which depend
for their operation on an external power source such as an electrical socket or
a car battery are not excluded from the range of interception devices
authorized by the Code. The use by the police of this device was also
permitted under the authorization since its clauses did not impose a limitation
on the type of device to be used.

 

                   V's
communications were not caught by the authorization and were inadmissible.
Because she was not named in the authorization, V's communications could only
be lawfully intercepted if they qualified as those of an ""unknown""
person under the basket clause in the authorization. For the purposes of Part
IV.1 of the Code, a particular person is ""known"" if she is a
person whose identity was known to the police at the time they applied for the
authorization and if she is a person ""the interception of whose private
communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist
the investigation of the offence"" (s. 178.12(1)(a)). An
""unknown"" person is a person who does not meet these two conditions.
In this case, the police knew of the existence of V when they applied for the
authorization and, on the basis of the total knowledge the police had about her
association with W, including her close relationship and her joint criminal
activities with him, it was reasonable to assume that her private
communications would, or could, assist the investigation of the offences
outlined in the authorization. V therefore did not qualify as an
""unknown"" person and the Crown could not rely on the basket clause to
introduce in evidence her private communications. She was a ""known""
person as defined in Part IV.1 of the Code and, not being named in the
authorization, her private communications could not be intercepted under the
authorization.

 

                   The
Crown may not adduce evidence of the interception of V's private communications
on the basis that they were made during conversations with persons whose
communications were lawfully intercepted. Section 178.16(1) of the Code
provides in the clearest terms that an intercepted private communication is inadmissible
as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended to receive
it, unless the interception was lawfully made or the originator of it or the
person intended by the originator to receive it has consented to the admission
of the evidence. Here, V's communications were at issue. Their interception was
unlawful and V did not consent to their admission.

 

                   Per Wilson
J.: All forms of entry are not authorized by necessary implication in Part IV.1
of the Criminal Code  but only those forms which represent the least
intrusive way of implementing the authorization. Accordingly, if an
authorization can be implemented without violation of the criminal or civil
law, the authority to commit such a violation should not be read into it. Such
violation is not in such a case authorized by necessary implication. The police
must act in a responsible fashion and intrude upon the accused's privacy no
more than is reasonably necessary in order to instal the device. The manner of
entry and installation is therefore relevant under s. 178.16(1)(a) of
the Code and it is still for the courts to determine whether the
particular form of entry and installation in issue was the least intrusive
means that could reasonably have been employed in order to implement the authorization.
Only then will it have been authorized by necessary implication and only then
will it have been, in the words of s. 178.16(1) (a), ""lawfully
made"". In this case, the police acted responsibly in connecting the device
to the vehicle's battery since otherwise repeated intrusions would have been
required in order to change the batteries in the device. The entry and
installation was accordingly ""lawfully made"".

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (1985), 39 Alta. L.R. (2d) 331,
62 A.R. 64, [1985] 6 W.W.R. 289, 21 C.C.C. (3d) 68, 47 C.R. (3d) 157, allowing
the Crown's appeal from the acquittals of the accused on a charge of conspiracy
to commit robbery and kidnapping and ordering a new trial. Vanweenan's appeal
is allowed and Chesson's appeal is dismissed.

 

                   James
J. Ogle and Alain Hepner, for the appellants.

 

                   Earl
C. Wilson, for the respondent.

 

                   The
judgment of Beetz, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                       McIntyre J.‑‑This
appeal is taken as of right, pursuant to s. 618(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code . The appellants were jointly charged along with several others with conspiracy
to commit robbery and kidnapping. They were tried in the Court of Queen's Bench
of Alberta by a judge sitting without a jury. The Crown's case was largely
dependent on certain private oral and telephone communications of the
appellants which were intercepted under a judicial authorization, granted on
June 29, 1983. On a voir dire, the trial judge held that the
interceptions were all unlawful under Part IV.1 of the Code, and
excluded them from evidence. As a result, he acquitted both appellants. The
Crown succeeded in an appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal. The acquittals
were unanimously overturned and a new trial was ordered. This appeal resulted.

 

2.                       The
broad issue in this Court was whether the interceptions were obtained within
the provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . Concerning both
appellants, the issue arises as to whether the surreptitious installation in a
motor vehicle by police of a listening device, connected to the battery of the
motor vehicle, constitutes an unlawful interception. With respect to Vanweenan
alone, further issues arise as to whether she is a person whose private
communications were within the contemplation of the authorization, and whether
her private communications were admissible in view of the fact that they were
made to persons whose communications were lawfully intercepted under the
authorization. A third issue was raised by Vanweenan relating to the reach of
the authorization which it was not necessary to decide.

 

Facts

 

3.                       In
December, 1982, one Neil Whiteman became engaged in a plan to rob a Calgary
supermarket. He obtained from an employee of the store, who later gave evidence
for the Crown at his trial, information as to the layout and operation of the
store, including the location of the safe, and the name and identity of the
head cashier who had a key to the safe. The plan was that the head cashier
would be kidnapped in the store's parking lot in the evening after store‑closing.
She would then be forced to re‑enter the store and open the safe. On
December 19, 1982, the head cashier on opening her car door saw a masked man
hiding in the back seat of her car. She slammed the door shut and ran in one
direction. The masked man ran in another direction and the store remained
secure. No arrests were made.

 

4.                       In
June, 1983, the police were investigating Whiteman and others, not including
the appellants, concerning several property offences not connected with charges
in the case at bar. For this purpose on June 29, 1983, they applied for and
were granted by Waite J., of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, a judicial
authorization, valid for 60 days, which empowered designated persons to
intercept telecommunications and oral communications as set out in the
authorization:

 

. . . and for such purpose to install, monitor, or
remove any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device including
where necessary, entering those places set out in Paragraphs 3 and 4 herein
that may be required to implement this Authorization.

 

Paragraph 3
named four known persons whose communications could be intercepted and four
addresses in Calgary where the interceptions could be made. Neither of the
appellants was named in the authorization. Paragraphs 3 and 4 also authorized
the police to intercept private communications of the four named individuals,
as well as those of unknown persons:

 

. . . at any other place, stationary or mobile, in the
Province of Alberta, that the known persons are using or attending or can be
reasonably expected to use or attend.

 

The
offences in respect of which the authorization permitted the interceptions were
theft, conspiracy to commit theft, possession of stolen property, conspiracy to
possess stolen property, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to break and
enter.

 

5.                       The
Crown's position was that as a result of its investigation and surveillance
evidence had been revealed that Whiteman, the two appellants, and two other
individuals had revived the plan to rob the supermarket by kidnapping the cashier
and forcing her to open the safe. The Crown claimed that Whiteman and his
girlfriend, the appellant Vanweenan, in pursuit of this scheme placed the head
cashier under surveillance by following her in Whiteman's truck. While Whiteman
and Vanweenan were following and observing the cashier, the police were
following and observing Whiteman and Vanweenan. To further the investigation
relating to the robbery of the supermarket, the police concluded that they
might procure evidence by placing a listening device in Whiteman's truck. On
July 7, 1983, acting under the authorization which had been granted earlier,
the police were able to place surreptitiously a short‑range listening
device in Whiteman's truck. It was wired to the truck's battery which provided
power for its transmitter.

 

6.                       At
trial, the technician who installed the device in the truck said that although
the device drew power from the battery, it had no negative effect upon the
battery because once the vehicle started it would recharge and restore any lost
power. He acknowledged that in theory the device could drain all power from the
battery, rendering it wholly inoperative, but this would occur only if it were
left in the vehicle and the vehicle itself was not started for thirty
consecutive days. It was not disputed that in this case the device caused no
injury to vehicle or battery.

 

7.                       Surveillance
was maintained until the end of July 1983 when the plan to rob the supermarket
was again abandoned. The various parties to these events were arrested,
including the two appellants who pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.

 

8.                       The
intercepted private communications, which were tendered as evidence by the
Crown, include (a) conversations between Vanweenan, who was not named in the
authorization, and Neil Whiteman, who was named; (b) a conversation between
Vanweenan and Ted Christianou, neither of whom was named in the authorization;
(c) a conversation between Vanweenan, Chesson and Whiteman; and (d)
conversations between Chesson and an unidentified person in the truck.

 

Judgments

 

9.                       The
trial judge at the conclusion of a voir dire on the question of the
admissibility of the interceptions held that none of the intercepted
communications of the appellants were receivable in evidence. He was of the
view that the surreptitious entry into Whiteman's vehicle to plant the
listening device constituted a trespass and a criminal mischief under s. 387(1) (c)
of the Criminal Code  (interfering with the lawful use of property). He
concluded that all interceptions made from the truck, which included all those
sought to be tendered against Chesson and some of those against Vanweenan, were
unlawfully made and therefore inadmissible under s. 178.16 of the Code.
He also concluded that all of the communications of the appellant Vanweenan
were inadmissible because they were not caught by the authorization. She was
not named in the authorization, therefore her communications could be lawfully
intercepted only if she was an ""unknown"" person within the terms of
the basket clause. She could only be an unknown person if she was not a
""known"" person within Part IV.1 of the Code, a known person
being one ""the interception of whose private communications there are
reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist the investigation of the
offence"" (s. 178.12(1) (e)). At the time they applied for the
authorization, the police knew Vanweenan was Whiteman's girlfriend and that
they had been associated together in criminal activities in the past. The trial
judge also noted that on the voir dire the police investigator managing
the case admitted that from the total knowledge the police had about
Vanweenan's relationship with Whiteman, it was reasonable to believe that she
would be able to assist in the investigation of the property offences covered
by the authorization. He therefore concluded that Vanweenan was a known person
as defined in Part IV.1 of the Code and, not being named in the
authorization, her intercepted communications were not admissible.

 

10.                     In
the Court of Appeal, Laycraft C.J.A. delivered the unanimous judgment of the
court (Laycraft C.J.A., Belzil J.A. and McBain J. (ad hoc)). The Crown's
appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. As to the interceptions made by the
planting of the listening device in Whiteman's vehicle, he observed that in
view of this Court's judgment in Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
633, and the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, decisions rendered
after that of the trial judge in this case, it was settled that authorizations
giving the police express power to enter surreptitiously upon private premises
for the purpose of installing listening devices were authorized under Part IV.1
of the Code. He also rejected the argument that Lyons was
distinguishable on the basis that the listening device drew on the vehicle
battery and, in theory, would damage or destroy it. This fact, it had been
argued, made the interceptions unlawful as resulting from criminal mischief,
under s. 387(1) of the Code. In rejecting this argument, the Court of
Appeal expressed the view that ""wilfully"" in s. 387(1) of the Code
was defined in s. 386(1) as the doing of an act which will probably produce the
prohibited result, whereas in this instance damage or destruction of the
battery was only a possibility. Damage to or destruction of the battery would
only result, according to the evidence, if the truck were unused for thirty
days. The police would not have planted the device in such case since their
object would have been frustrated. They planted the device only in the
expectation and virtual certainty that the vehicle would be kept in use. They,
therefore, never contemplated any injury to the battery. This determined the
issue against Chesson.

 

11.                     As
to whether Vanweenan was a known person, Laycraft C.J.A. considered that the
question to be determined was not one of her guilt or innocence of the crimes
being investigated or her participation in them. Rather, the relevant question
for determination was whether or not she was a person whose communications
might assist in the investigation of the offence. The judgment of the court is
now reported at (1985), 47 C.R. (3d) 157. He said, at p. 165:

 

The question here was not whether Vanweenan might be a
party to the offences named in the authorization. Rather the question was
whether the interception of her private communications might assist the
investigation.

 

                   In my opinion the bare facts known
did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the
interception of Vanweenan's private communications might assist the
investigation. That she was Whiteman's girlfriend did not provide any reasonable
and probable ground to believe he would tell her of the offences under
investigation or, further, that she would tell someone else. The additional
factor of her previous involvement with him in drug offences does not add
sufficient additional grounds. Authorizations are not to be granted
indiscriminately on the basis merely of past association in different criminal
activity or merely because of a social or marital relationship. In my opinion
an authorization could not have been granted naming Vanweenan as a subject of
interceptions on the basis of the two facts known. She was not, therefore, a
""known"" person within the meaning of s. 178.12(1) (e) of the
Criminal Code .

 

He went on
and, after reviewing several of the authorities, concluded that even if Vanweenan
were a ""known"" person, within the meaning of Part IV.1 of the Code,
her communications were validly intercepted under the basket clause in the
authorization. He expressed the view that whether a person is known or unknown,
his communications may be lawfully intercepted under an appropriately worded
basket clause. He therefore concluded that the basket clause authorized the
interception of the communications of Vanweenan and Whiteman and Vanweenan and
Christianou.

 

12.                     In
this Court, the appellant Chesson advanced only one ground upon which he sought
to have his appeal allowed and his acquittal restored. It was expressed in
these words in his factum:

 

The Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the
placing of an acoustic device by police in a car, which device depended for its
power source on the car battery, did not in law constitute an offence contrary
to s. 387  of the Criminal Code .

 

13.                     The
appellant Vanweenan advanced four grounds of appeal in her factum, one of which
was a reiteration of the ground advanced by Chesson, and the three others may
be conveniently expressed in two propositions. Firstly, it was contended on her
behalf that it was error on the part of the Court of Appeal to overrule the
finding of the trial judge that she was a ""known"" person at the time
of the application for and the granting of the authorization; secondly, it was
error to hold that whether or not she was a known person, her communications
were lawfully intercepted under the basket clause, or were admissible because
they were communications with a person named as a ""known"" person or
otherwise authorized in the authorization.

 

14.                     The
approach to the admissibility of evidence in wiretap cases rarely depends upon
questions of relevance or probative value or any of the other considerations
which arise from time to time with evidentiary problems. The question in each
case is, subject to limited exceptions not relevant here, simply one of legality
and it is limited to whether the provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code  have been complied with. As succinctly stated by Dickson J. (as he
then was), in Lyons, supra, in a dissenting judgment but not on
this point, at p. 640:

 

For purposes of Part IV.1, therefore, not only is the
manner in which evidence has been obtained relevant for its admissibility,
legality has become the sine qua non for admissibility.

 

Part IV.1
gives statutory force to this principle in s. 178.16(1)(a). It follows,
then, that in this case, like the great majority of wiretap cases, the issue of
the admissibility of evidence will begin and end with the question whether the
evidence was obtained by the police in compliance with the provisions of Part
IV.1 of the Code.

 

15.                     It
should be observed by way of introduction that the appellants do not contest
the validity of the authorization; they challenge powers conferred by the
authorization and the fact that the order itself authorizes the interception of
any communications of Vanweenan. Moreover, the fact that the evidence relating
to the alleged conspiracy to kidnap the cashier and rob the supermarket was
procured under an authorization which did not mention these offences does not
invalidate the interceptions: see R. v. Commisso, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 121.
Where, as in this case, the police obtain an authorization in good faith and in
a bona fide investigation of the offences listed in the authorization
they obtain evidence pertaining to other offences, the fortuitous interception
is not rendered unlawful. As noted by Lamer J. in Commisso, any other
rule would run counter to the purposes of Part IV.1; it is the privacy of those
intercepted and not the subject‑matter of conversations that is protected
by Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code . It is to be noted, as well, that the
Court's decision in Lyons, supra, and the Wiretap Reference,
supra, make it clear that where there is a surreptitious entry by the
police on premises in order to instal listening devices which depend for their
operation upon such entry, interceptions so obtained are lawful in the absence
of a prohibition in the authorization. It was pointed out by Estey J. in Lyons
that Part IV.1 of the Code contemplates, requires and authorizes
""by necessary implication and unavoidable inference"" such entry upon
private property where, as here, the equipment authorized to be used requires
such entry for its effective operation.

 

Truck
Interception by Use of Vehicle Battery

 

16.                     As
earlier mentioned, the police, acting under the authorization, surreptitiously
installed a listening device in Whiteman's truck which drew its power from the
truck's battery. The Lyons case, supra, and the Wiretap
Reference, supra, in my view clearly dispose of the question of
entry. As noted above, it was there established that a covert or a
surreptitious entry into private property for the purpose of installing an
authorized listening device as an incident to the execution of a valid
authorization is a power contemplated ""by necessary implication and
unavoidable inference"" in Part IV.1 of the Code. Therefore, despite
the fact that the entry might otherwise amount to unlawful conduct, the
interception would be lawful under s. 178.16(1)(a) as having been authorized
by Parliament. If the interception conforms with the authorization and it is
carried out within the powers given in Part IV.1, the interception has been
lawfully made. The critical issue in any case where police power is questioned
is whether lawful authority exists for it: Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739; Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, and  R. v. Landry,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 145. It follows, then, that the real issue here is not, as
asserted by the appellants, whether the conduct amounts to criminal mischief
but is simply whether the police action in installing the listening device in
the truck falls within the authority conferred by Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code . In the face of the decisions in Lyons and the Wiretap
Reference, there can be only one answer as far as the actual entry and
installation goes. It was clearly lawful.

 

17.                     The
real point of argument raised by the appellants in respect of the interception,
however, is that the use of a device connected to and draining the truck's
battery was not authorized and is unlawful. In my view, this argument must be
rejected. Estey J. in Lyons pointed out that Part IV.1 authorizes the
use of all manner of interception devices, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic,
and others. Radio transmitters are among the most commonly used and well‑known
interception devices. They clearly come within the contemplation of Part IV.1
of the Criminal Code . Radio transmitters which rely for power on a
source within the invaded premises‑‑because they do not require
replacement of batteries and the repeated intrusions this process would require‑‑are
favoured by the police. These devices have long existed and are frequently
used: see Studies for the National Commission for the Review of Federal and
State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance (1976), at
pp. 174 and 204, and Watt, Law of Electronic Surveillance in Canada
(1979), at p. 183. The existence of these devices, depending for their
operation on an external power source such as an electrical socket or a car
battery, were undoubtedly known to Parliament in the long process of review and
consideration which led to the enactment of Part IV.1 of the Code. If
Parliament had desired to exclude such devices from police use, it could have
readily done so. Parliament did not do so. Rather, in Part IV.1 it authorized
the use, subject to judicial control, of all manner of devices capable of
intercepting private communications. I see no basis on which this Court would
be justified in carving out an exception from the general provisions of the Code
which would forbid the use of this type of device. I would support this view by
reference to the words of Estey J. in Lyons, at pp. 663‑64:

 

                   Part IV.1 contemplates at least three
fundamental processes or devices which may be employed in the interception of a
private communication: electromagnetic (radio, telephone and optical), acoustic
and mechanical devices. There is no particular provision relating to each of
these special types or forms of communication. All are embraced in the same
general provisions. It is therefore clear that Parliament, in Part IV.1, is
legislating with reference to the employment of any equipment or procedure
relating to the electromagnetic spectrum (ranging as it does through the
spectrum from radio waves to light waves), the acoustic vibrations above or
below and including the range of the human ear, and to mechanical devices, for
the purpose of intercepting oral (and other) communication occurring anywhere.

 

In my
opinion, the ""clear and irresistible implication"" to be drawn from
Part IV.1 of the Code is that devices, such as the one used in this
case, are not excluded from the range of interception devices authorized by the
Code.

 

18.                     The
remaining question with respect to the interception in Whiteman's truck is
whether the authorization in this case permitted the use of the device
employed. In my view, there can be no doubt it did. The opening passage is in
these terms:

 

                   it is
ordered that any person who has been designated pursuant to Section
178.13(2.1)  of the Criminal Code  and any other person acting in aid of a
designated person, are hereby authorized to intercept private communications as
hereinafter set out, and for such purpose to install, monitor, or remove any
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device including, where
necessary, entering those places set out in Paragraphs 3 and 4 herein that may
be required to implement this Authorization.

 

Clause 5 of
the authorization provides:

 

The manner of interception of the private communications
of the known and unknown persons is to listen to and/or to record the private
communications by use of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device or apparatus that is capable of being used to intercept a private
communication.

 

These
clauses impose no limitation on the type of device to be used. The use by the
police of this device, then, is authorized under the authorization. It may be
noted, as well, that in R. v. Lawrence, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 619, this Court
held that a clause authorizing the police to use in their discretion ""any
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device"" contemplated by
Part IV.1 of the Code is sufficient to conform with the requirement in
s. 178.13(2)(c) that an authorization ""generally describe the
manner of interception that may be used"". The interceptions by the device
installed in Whiteman's truck were lawfully made. Since this was the only
ground raised by the appellant Chesson, his appeal must fail and be dismissed.
The additional grounds raised by Vanweenan must be considered.

 

Additional
Grounds Advanced by Vanweenan

 

19.                     The
essence of Vanweenan's argument may be shortly stated. She says, I am not named
in the authorization. Therefore, my private communications may not be
intercepted and admitted in evidence against me unless they qualify as those of
an ""unknown"" person under the basket clause. The basket clause cannot
extend to my communications because I am not an ""unknown"" person. In
considering this argument, the provisions of Part IV.1 of the Code must
be examined. Section 178.12(1) (e) requires inter alia that on an
application for an authorization the deponent must by affidavit state ""the
names, addresses and occupations, if known, of all persons the interception of
whose private communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe may assist the investigation of the offence"". Section 178.13(2)(c)
requires inter alia that the authorization itself shall state ""the
identity of the persons, if known, whose private communications are to be
intercepted"". The implication which the courts have drawn from the use of
the words ""if known"" in the latter section is that an authorization
may empower police to intercept communications of persons ""unknown""
to the police when they apply for the authorization. This proposition was
established very early in the day by Zuber J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court
of Appeal, in R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d)
363, at p. 375, where he said:

 

Section 178.13(2)(c) itself provides that an
authorization can provide for the interception of communications of unknown
persons. The fact the legislation specifically provides for this kind of
authorization reinforces the argument that if the authorization does name only
specific persons, the limit of the authorization must be adhered to.

 

(See as
well Watt, op. cit., at pp. 97‑99.)

 

A clause in
an authorization, such as clause 4 in the case at bar, which authorizes the
interception of private communications of unknown persons is known as a
""basket"" clause. It permits the interception of private
communications of any person unknown to the police at the time of the
application for the authorization who communicates at locations designated in
the authorization: see R. v. Samson (1983), 36 C.R. (3d) 126 (Ont. C.A.)
It is apparent then that an authorization with a basket clause may permit the
interception of communications from two groups, the known and the unknown
persons.

 

20.                     How
is it to be decided whether a particular person is known or unknown for the
purposes of Part IV.1 of the Code? In my opinion, the answer to this
question is to be found in Part IV.1 itself. The starting point is s.
178.12(1)(e) of the Code, which sets out the two pre‑conditions
to be met before a person may be lawfully identified and named in an
authorization and thus be a known person. The first and most obvious condition
is that the existence of that person must be known to the police. Second, and
equally important, however, is the additional requirement that the person
satisfy the standard of being one ""the interception of whose private
communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist
the investigation of the offence"". If at the time the police apply for a
judicial authorization a person meets both these criteria, he will be a known person
and therefore, if the interceptions of his communications are to be admitted
against him, he must be named in the authorization as a target for
interception. If he is not named his interceptions are not receivable since
there is no authority to make them. A ""known"" person, then, for the
purposes of Part IV.1 of the Code is one who satisfies the two criteria
in s. 178.12(1) (e).

 

21.                     An
unknown person, therefore, is a person who does not meet these conditions at
the time the police apply for an authorization. Accordingly, for the Crown to
rely on a basket clause to introduce interceptions of private communications in
evidence, they must be made by one whose existence was not known to the police
at the time of the application for the authorization, or who was not at that
time known to the police as one ""the interception of whose private
communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist
the investigation of the offence"". It is common ground that in the present
case the police knew of the existence of Vanweenan when they applied for the
authorization. To decide, then, whether the Crown can tender her interceptions
under the basket clause, it must be determined whether she was one ""the
interception of whose private communications there are reasonable and probable
grounds to believe may assist the investigation of the offence"". If she
was, the Crown correctly concedes that it may not rely on the basket clause to
tender her private communications for she does not qualify as an unknown
person: see R. v. Crease (No. 2) (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 378 (Ont. C.A.);
R. v. Blacquiere (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 330 (P.E.I.S.C.), and R. v.
Meidel (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 77 (B.C. Co. Ct.)

 

22.                     It
was argued that the question whether a person is a ""known"" person in
this context is a question of fact and, accordingly, it was error for the Court
of Appeal to entertain the appeal, because no appeal could lie from the
acquittal on a question of fact. I would agree with the Court of Appeal's
rejection of this argument where Laycraft C.J.A. said, at p. 164:

 

                   It is first urged that the finding
that Vanweenan was a ""known"" person is a finding of fact not open to
a Crown appeal by the provisions of s. 605. In my view that contention confuses
the facts found with the result in law which flows from them. The facts found‑‑the
relationship between Whiteman and Vanweenan and her previous criminal activity‑‑cannot
be questioned on a Crown appeal. But whether those facts made her a
""known"" person within the meaning of s. 178.12(1) (e) of the
Criminal Code  is a question of law.

 

The
determination of the question of law, however, depends upon the underlying
finding of fact. The question then is: At the time of the application for the
authorization did reasonable and probable grounds exist for the belief that the
interception of her private communications could assist the investigation? I
would disagree on this point with the Court of Appeal. It would seem to me that
there can only be an affirmative answer to this question. Vanweenan was a known
person and the Crown may not rely on the basket clause to introduce the
interceptions of her communications. I would accept the trial judge's
determination of this question. At (1984), 33 Alta. L.R. (2d) 85, at pp. 87‑88,
he said:

 

I acknowledge that the deponent on the application,
Detective Mosley, may have known the defendant as merely the girlfriend of
Whiteman, but the fact is that there was much more information about the
defendant available to him from both the police files and other investigators
who were instructing him, and as he was making his application largely on
information supplied by others, it was incumbent upon them, those informing
him, to fully inform him of all persons known by them, that is known in the
sense contemplated by the legislation. The investigator managing the case,
Detective Peterson, candidly admits that from the total knowledge the police
had about Vanweenan's association with Whiteman, including her close
relationship with him, her alleged criminal activities, joint criminal
activities with him, it was reasonable to believe that she would be able to
assist in the investigation of the offences outlined in the authorization. I do
not hesitate in holding that the only way such assistance could have been
obtained would have been by intercepting her private communications. She
certainly wouldn't have been about to co‑operate with the police and an
attempt to interfere with her would have been‑‑as the detective
said it would have blown the whole cover. She was, therefore a
""known"" person as contemplated by the legislation.

 

23.                     Vanweenan
and Whiteman were close associates and in the past had joined in criminal
activity. She was the girlfriend of Whiteman and surveillance of the Whiteman
vehicle prior to June 29 established her use of the vehicle. She had previously
been involved in criminal activity with him and on June 29, 1983 Vanweenan and
Whiteman were co‑accused under an indictment with respect to drug
offences. The police officer, Peterson, considered it reasonable to assume that
her private communications would, or could, assist the investigation. All that
was required to include her in the application was reasonable and probable
grounds that her communications may assist. This test was met in the
present case. I would therefore conclude that she was a ""known""
person and that the Crown may not rely on the basket clause.

 

May the
Crown Adduce Evidence of the Interception of Vanweenan's Private Communications
on the Basis that They Were Made During Conversations with Persons whose
Communications Were Lawfully Intercepted?

 

24.                     In
my view, this argument may be quickly disposed of. Section 178.16(1) provides
in the clearest terms that an intercepted private communication is inadmissible
as evidence against the originator thereof or the person intended to receive
it, unless the interception was lawfully made or the originator of it or the
person intended by the originator to receive it has consented to the admission
of the evidence. The communications sought to be introduced here are those of
Vanweenan. We have already concluded that the interception of her
communications was unlawful and there is here no question of any consent. I
would reject the suggestion that her communications are swept into the lawful
interception of Whiteman and Christianou with whom she was speaking during the
interceptions. She retained, because of the non‑compliance with Part IV.1
and the absence of her consent, the protection of Part IV.1 of the Code.
I would refer to the passage from the majority judgment in Goldman v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976, at p. 995:

 

In my view, the difference between the word conversation
and the word communication is, in the context of this statutory provision,
significant. A communication involves the passing of thoughts, ideas, words or
information from one person to another. Conversation is a broader term and it
would include, as all conversations do, an interchange of a series of separate
communications. It is consistent with the scheme of Part IV.1, in my view, to
consider that the originator of a private communication within the meaning of
s. 178.1 is the person who makes the remark or series of remarks which the
Crown seeks to adduce in evidence. If a person, with a reasonable
expectation of privacy, speaking in an electronically intercepted conversation
makes statements which the Crown seeks to use against him, he has, in my view,
as the originator of those statements, the protection of the privacy provisions
of the Criminal Code  because those statements constitute private
communications upon his part and their admissibility at any subsequent trial
will depend upon the provisions of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code .
[Emphasis added.]

 

25.                     In
summary, then, Vanweenan is not a ""known"" person whose private
communications could be intercepted under the authorization, because though she
was a person whose identity was known to the police and was one ""the
interception of whose private communications there are reasonable and probable
grounds to believe may assist the investigation of the offence"", she was
not named in the authorization. She is not an ""unknown"" person whose
communications could be intercepted under the basket clause because her
identity was known and, as has been noted, was one ""the interception of
whose private communications there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe may assist the investigation of the offence"".

 

26.                     As
for Vanweenan, then, the appeal is allowed and her acquittal is restored. As
for Chesson, however, the appeal is dismissed and the order for a new trial is
affirmed.

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

27.                     Wilson J.‑‑I
have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague, Justice McIntyre, in this
appeal and concur in his result and in most of his reasoning. I do, however,
have a concern in one area.

 

28.                     This
Court held in Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, and in the Wiretap
Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, that if an entry is required in order to
implement an authorization to instal a listening device in a particular place,
then the authorization by necessary implication authorizes the entry into that
place as well as the installation of the device. The Court by a majority
(Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.) held in Lyons that the fact that
the entry constituted a trespass did not mean that the interception was not
""lawfully made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissented on the basis that an
authorization to intercept private communications does not implicitly carry
with it a right to enter private premises and accordingly is not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of the section.

 

29.                     The
appellants submit that these cases do not authorize entries which would violate
other provisions of the Criminal Code  or violate other laws which it
is not necessary to violate in order to implement the authorization. They
conceded that if there was no violation of s. 387  of the Criminal Code ,
the mischief section, then the interception was ""lawfully made"". I
agree with the courts below and with McIntyre J. that there was no violation of
s. 387  in this case and I note, in particular, that s. 386(2) of the Code provides
that no one can be convicted under s. 387  where the person was acting
""with legal justification or excuse and with colour of right"": see R.
v. Ninos and Walker, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 326 (N.S.S.C. in banco), and R.
v. Creaghan (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.)

 

30.                     I
wish to stress, however, that in my view it is not every form of entry which is
authorized by necessary implication under Lyons and the Wiretap
Reference. Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  is headed ""Invasion
of Privacy"" and the Part clearly represents a legislative compromise
between the privacy interest of the individual and the competing interest of
the public in law enforcement: see R. v. Commisso, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 121,
at pp. 124‑25, per Lamer J. I am sympathetic, therefore, to the
general proposition advanced by the appellants that all forms of entry are not
authorized by necessary implication but only those forms which represent the
least intrusive way of implementing the authorization. I think that this
qualification may be implicit, although not expressly articulated, in the
previous authorities. But if I am wrong in that, I believe it is a
qualification to which they should be subject. Accordingly, if an authorization
can be implemented without violation of the criminal or civil law, the
authority to commit such a violation should not be read into it. Such
violation, in my view, is not in such a case authorized by necessary
implication. I do not mean to suggest, of course, that the police must go
to inordinate lengths to provide maximum protection of the accused's privacy in
their mode of entry and installation. I simply say that they must act in a
responsible fashion and intrude upon the accused's privacy no more than is
reasonably necessary in order to instal the device. I think the police acted
responsibly in this case in connecting the device to the truck's battery since
otherwise repeated intrusions would have been required in order to change the
batteries in the device.

 

31.                     My
only disagreement with my colleague then is that I believe that the manner of
entry and installation is relevant under s. 178.16(1) (a). Lyons
and the Wiretap Reference do not provide a conclusive answer to an
allegation that the manner of entry and installation violated another provision
of the Criminal Code  or our civil law. There is a middle course between
the positions of the majority and the minority in these cases and I would
respectfully adopt it. It is still for the courts to determine whether the
particular form of entry and installation in issue was the least intrusive
means that could reasonably have been employed in order to implement the authorization.
Only then, in my view, will it have been authorized by necessary implication
and only then will it have been, in the words of s. 178.16(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code , ""lawfully made"".

J. ‑‑ In this appeal as of right, we agree with the Court of
Appeal that the trial judge erred in ordering a stay of proceedings in the
circumstances.  The Crown produced a copy of the statement and a transcript of

produced.  If the Crown has the originals of documents which ought to be
produced, it should either produce them or allow them to be inspected.  If,
however, the originals are not available and if they had been in the Crown's
possession, then it should explain their absence.  If the explanation is
satisfactory, the Crown has discharged its obligation unless the conduct which

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

1                 Iacobucci
J. ‑‑ We all agree that this appeal is governed by the
principles recently discussed by our Court in R. v. Burns, [1994] 1
S.C.R. 656, and related cases.  The decision in Burns was not available
to the Ontario Court of Appeal when it rendered its judgment.  While it is
clearly preferable to give reasons and although there may be some cases where
reasons may be necessary, by itself, the absence of reasons of a trial judge
cannot be a ground for appellate review when the finding is otherwise
supportable on the evidence or where the basis of the finding is apparent from
the circumstances.  The issue is the reasonableness of the finding not an
absence or insufficiency of reasons.  In this case, the basis for the ruling of
the trial judge on the voir dire is clear.  The only issue was
credibility.  The trial judge's ruling demonstrated that he did not accept the
evidence of the accused.  In these circumstances, the failure of the trial
judge to state the basis of his decision on the voir dire did not
occasion an error of law or miscarriage of justice.  We also find no error in
law in the charge to the jury.

 

2                 Accordingly, the appeal is
allowed, the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal is set aside, and the
convictions entered at trial are restored.

                   The judgment of the

1                 Sopinka
J. ‑‑ We see no reason to depart from the jurisprudence of
this Court that the co‑conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule
applies to substantive offences in which evidence is introduced that acts were
done or words spoken in furtherance of a common design to commit the offence.

 

2                 The application of the exception
is authoritatively described in R. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938.  With
respect to its application here, we agree with Wood J.A., speaking for a
unanimous Court of Appeal, that, although the trial judge erred in his
instructions to the jury with respect to the co‑conspirator's exception
to the hearsay rule, the error did not occasion a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.  Evidence directly admissible against the appellant to
which resort could be had in order to invoke the exception was dependent on the
credibility of Amanda Cousins.  We agree with Wood J.A. that the jury must have
accepted the evidence of Cousins and, therefore, had the proper instruction
been given, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.

 

3                 We also agree with Wood J.A. and
his reasons that, in the circumstances, there was no error with respect to the
instructions to the jury on the doctrine of reasonable doubt.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

                   Criminal law —
Evidence — Disclosure — Crown's obligation to make disclosure to defence —
Defence informed that accuseds not primary or secondary wiretap targets in this
investigation — Defence requesting to be informed of whether or not accuseds
primary or secondary targets in wiretaps used in other investigations — Whether
accused has right to know if a target in wiretap authorizations unrelated to
investigation of current criminal charge ‑‑ Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , s. 7  — Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
ss. 187 , 189(2) , 193 , 196 .

 

                   Appellants
requested the provincial prosecutor and the Department of Justice to disclose
whether either appellant was named as primary or secondary target in any
undisclosed wiretaps during the period 1988 to April 15, 1992. The reply
was that there were no provincial wiretap authorizations in effect with respect
to this investigation during that time period but both Crowns declined to
confirm or deny the existence of any other authorizations. The appellants then
applied for an order requiring the Crown to answer the question, which motion
proceeded as a Stinchcombe application.

 

                   During the motion,
the appellants admitted that they had no evidence to demonstrate the relevance
to their defence of the information sought since they had no proof that there
had been any wiretap authorizations or that there was derivative evidence
obtained from wiretaps relevant to the charges. The appellants argued, however,
that once an accused has made a Stinchcombe application for disclosure,
the onus was on the Crown to justify its refusal to disclose on the basis that
the material was clearly irrelevant, or raised public interest privilege.

 

                   The motions judge
found that the onus in a Stinchcombe application was on the Crown and
that the appellants were entitled to disclosure of the requested information.
As a result of the refusal of the provincial and federal Crowns to comply with
the terms of the disclosure order, the appellants applied for and were granted
a judicial stay of proceedings respecting the indictment. The Alberta Court of
Appeal set aside both the disclosure order and the stay of proceedings, and
ordered a new trial. The issue on appeal was whether an accused facing trial on
a criminal charge is entitled to know if he or she has been named as a primary
or secondary target in any wiretap authorizations unrelated to the
investigation of the current criminal charge, obtained in the period from the
charges up to the time of trial.

 

                   Held: The appeal is dismissed.

 

                   The Crown's
disclosure obligation is shaped by the principles of fundamental justice
included in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and, in particular, the right to make full answer and defence. Generally, the Crown
must disclose all information, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, except
evidence that is beyond the control of the prosecution, clearly irrelevant, or
privileged. This obligation requires that the Crown exercise the utmost good
faith in determining which information must be disclosed and in providing
ongoing disclosure. Failure to comply with this initial and continuing
obligation to disclose relevant and non‑privileged evidence may result in
a stay of proceedings or other redress against the Crown, and may constitute a
serious breach of ethical standards. 

 

                   The Crown's
obligation to disclose is not absolute and, while it must err on the side of
inclusion, it need not produce what is clearly irrelevant. Relevance is
determined in relation to its use by the defence. When the Crown alleges that
it has discharged its obligation to disclose, an issue may arise as to whether
disclosure is complete in two situations, where the defence contends that: (1)
identified and existing material ought to have been produced, or that
(2) material whose existence is in dispute ought to have been produced.

 

                   In the first
situation, where the existence of certain information has been identified, the
Crown must justify non‑disclosure by demonstrating either that the information
sought is beyond its control, or that it is clearly irrelevant or privileged.
Justification of non‑disclosure on the grounds of public interest
privilege or other privilege may involve certain special procedures (such as
that referred to in s. 37(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act ) to protect
the confidentiality of the evidence.

 

                   In the second
situation, the Crown may dispute the existence of material which is alleged to
be relevant. Once the Crown alleges that it has fulfilled its obligation to
produce, it cannot be required to justify the non‑disclosure of material,
the existence of which it is unaware or denies. The defence, therefore, must
establish a basis which could enable the presiding judge to conclude that there
is in existence further material which is potentially relevant. Relevance means
a reasonable possibility of being useful to the accused in making full answer
and defence. The existence of the disputed material must be sufficiently
identified not only to reveal its nature but also to enable the presiding judge
to determine that it may meet the test with respect to material which the Crown
is obliged to produce. The matter may often be resolved by oral submissions of
counsel without need of a voir dire, though viva voce evidence
and a voir dire may be required where the presiding judge cannot resolve
the matter on the basis of submissions by counsel. The requirement that the
defence provide a basis for its demand for further production serves to
preclude speculative and time‑consuming disclosure requests, and avoid
impeding ongoing criminal investigations. 

 

                   If the defence
establishes a basis for the conclusion that the evidence may exist, the Crown
must then justify a continuing refusal to disclose. This obligation is the same
as that in first instance. If the matter cannot be resolved without viva
voce evidence, the Crown must be afforded an opportunity to call relevant
evidence. In cases involving confidential information, it may be appropriate
for the trial judge to order a hearing in camera, or privately inspect
the material in issue, applying procedures such as those set out in
s. 37(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . In cases involving wiretaps,
the procedure for protecting confidential information is dealt with in R. v.
Garofoli.

 

                   Applying the
foregoing to this appeal, the accuseds failed to establish a basis for the
existence of wiretap authorizations or evidence derived therefrom which is
potentially relevant to making full answer and defence.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

1                 Sopinka
J. — This appeal concerns the limits of Crown disclosure obligations in
criminal prosecutions, flowing from this Court's decision in R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, and amplifies the procedural structure of
disclosure obligations as articulated in R. v. Stinchcombe, and
subsequent case law. Specifically, the issue is whether an accused facing trial
on a criminal charge is entitled to know if he or she has been named as a
primary or secondary target in any wiretap authorizations unrelated to the
investigation of the current criminal charge, obtained in the period from the
charge up to the time of trial.

 

Facts

 

2                 Pursuant to an indictment, dated
July 9, 1991, the appellant, David Allan Chaplin, was charged with 22 counts,
and the appellant, Dale Leonard Chaplin, was charged with four counts of break
and enter and theft, allegedly committed between 1984 and 1989. The appellants
were arrested on these charges in December, 1989, and were free on bail through
to the commencement of their trial. The preliminary inquiry into these charges
resulted in an order for the appellants to stand trial.

 

3                 Since the appellants elected
trial by judge and jury, on March 20, 1992, a pre-hearing conference pursuant
to s. 625.1(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (ad. R.S.C.,
1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 127), took place. Given the complex evidentiary and
constitutional issues raised by the appellants, McDonald J. directed that April
15, 1992 to May 1, 1992 be set aside for the trial judge to deal with all
motions and evidentiary matters that could be determined in the absence of the
jury.

 

4                 Before the hearing commenced,
the appellants made a written request to the provincial prosecutor and to the
Edmonton office of the Department of Justice, requesting that provincial and
federal authorities disclose whether either of the appellants were named as
primary or secondary targets in any undisclosed Criminal Code , Part VI
electronic interceptions during the period 1988 to April 15, 1992.

 

5                 Counsel representing the
provincial and federal governments notified the appellants that:

                   (a)there
were no provincial wiretap authorizations in effect pertaining to this
particular investigation during the time period in question;

                   (b)the
provincial Crown declined to confirm or deny the existence of any other provincial
authorization that may have been in existence during the same time period; and

                   (c)the
federal Crown refused to confirm or deny the existence of any such
authorization during the relevant time period that may have been obtained in
relation to matters under federal jurisdiction.

 

It is very significant that the Crown
disclosed that there were no wiretap authorizations pertaining to the
investigation of the charges being tried in the time period in question.

 

6                 As a result of the Crown's
refusal, the appellants applied for an order directing the Crown to answer the
following question:

 

During
the period 1988 to April 15, 1992, were we [the appellants] named as either
primary or secondary targets of any authorizations to intercept private
communications granted in Edmonton or elsewhere in Alberta or in British
Columbia?

 

In their application, the appellants
also requested that, if they were in fact named as primary or secondary targets
in any such authorizations, the Crown disclose to them the authorizations, the
supporting affidavits and documents, the logs, transcripts, records, copies of
all recordings, and names and status of each person involved in the
surveillance.

 

7                 After an issue as to
presentation of evidence relied upon in support of the application and two
adjournments, the application proceeded as a Stinchcombe application as
to whether the appellants had an absolute right to ask the question and expect
an answer. The trial court heard the application on the basis of argument on
first principles, and if first principles failed, the parties would be
permitted to call evidence to address the issue of whether disclosure was
required.

 

8                 The appellants' reasons for
seeking disclosure from the Crown were three-fold:

                   (a)to
permit them to establish an evidentiary foundation for invoking the exclusionary
rule in s. 189(2) of the Code dealing with derivative evidence;

                   (b)to
prepare for cross-examination of witnesses and fully explore the nature of the
Crown's case in order to secure their right to a fair hearing as mandated by s.
7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ; and

                   (c)to
determine whether their constitutionally mandated rights to a fair trial and
consultation with counsel in private have been violated by police interception
of privileged communications between them and their lawyers contrary to ss. 7 ,
10 (b), and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

The respondent's reasons for refusing
disclosure were:

                   (a)to
answer the question would effectively bar investigating bodies from the use of
wiretap authorizations against persons charged with an offence or who may be
charged with an offence if the only basis for the demand needs to be
speculation without the necessity of showing any nexus between the disclosure
sought and the case the accused is facing;

                   (b)an
answer to the question would not conclude the matter and the question could be
raised up to the end of the trial; and

                   (c)the
circumstances of this case did not clearly trigger any of the provisions of s.
193(2).

 

The intervener's reasons for objecting
to disclosure of the requested information were based on its lack of relevance
and on public interest privilege.

 

9                 At the application, the
respondent submitted that this was a Charter  application and
consequently that the onus was on the appellants to demonstrate a Charter 
breach. In a Stinchcombe application, the initial onus of demonstrating
the relevance to their case of the requested information was on the accuseds.
The appellants admitted that they had no evidence to demonstrate the relevance
to their defence of the information sought since they had no proof that there
had been any wiretap authorizations or that there was derivative evidence
obtained therefrom relevant to the charges. The appellants argued, however,
that once the accused has made a Stinchcombe application for disclosure,
the onus was on the Crown to justify its refusal to disclose on the basis that the
material was clearly irrelevant, or raised public interest privilege.

 

10               The intervener, who had been
brought into the proceedings on the appellants' motion requesting an order for
disclosure of federal wiretap investigations, was granted leave to intervene in
the Alberta Court of Appeal. The Attorney General of Canada was also granted
leave to intervene in this Court.

 

11               The respondent's application to
quash the appellants' notice of appeal as of right pursuant to s. 691(2)(a),
asserting that the judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal setting aside a stay
of proceeding and directing a new trial did not give rise to an appeal as of
right, was dismissed by this Court on March 4, 1994.

 

Judgments Below

 

Alberta Court of Queen's Bench

 

12               On April 21, 1992, Veit J. of the
Alberta Court of Queen's Bench ruled that the onus in a Stinchcombe
application was on the Crown, and that the appellants were entitled to
disclosure of the requested information. As a result of the refusal of the
provincial and federal Crowns to comply with the terms of the disclosure order,
the appellants applied for and were granted on April 29, 1992, a judicial stay
of proceedings respecting the indictment.

 

13               In making the disclosure order on
April 21, 1992, Veit J. held that the onus was on the Crown to provide full
disclosure. If the Crown refused full disclosure, the Court had to determine
what must be disclosed. She noted that sometimes, the Crown's onus will be
easily satisfied, such as where the requested disclosure is outside the
knowledge of the prosecutorial authorities, irrelevant to the charge, or
subject to a non-disclosure privilege. She also noted that the public policy
concerns authorizing interception of confidential communications confront the
right of an individual to make full answer and defence. The public policy
objective of protecting informants may be achieved by editing disclosures.

 

14               Veit J. held that the Crown had
not established that it was impractical for it to answer the question. The
question was specific and the answer could easily be given after making
necessary internal investigations. She rejected the argument that the accused
persons had not established the relevancy of the evidence to their ability to
make full answer and defence since such requirement would effectively make the
Crown's police witness the arbiter of disclosure. There was prima facie
relevance to the accuseds' claim given derivative evidence considerations, and
potential state interception of solicitor/client communications. The appellants
were in a ""Catch 22"" situation similar to that in Dersch v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505, unable to prove that the answer
to the question would be useful in the same way that those asking for an
interception packet to be opened cannot prove that the packet will contain
useful information. She rejected the provincial Crown's floodgates concern on
the basis that she did not have to resolve the limits of disclosure.

 

15               After Veit J.'s judgment was
delivered, the provincial Crown prosecutor asked to call evidence demonstrating
that the answers to the questions sought were irrelevant, prior to the order to
answer being made. Veit J. refused to permit the calling of evidence showing
that no person involved in the investigation or prosecution had knowledge of
any information obtained by virtue of any wiretap investigation of the
appellants, holding that such evidence was irrelevant (since the police
officers would just state that they did not know of any interception), and
unnecessary.

 

16               After an adjournment, the
respondent returned stating that it would not answer the question, relying on:
(a) the presumption of regularity that the provisions of s. 196 of the Code
had been complied with and that there were no expired wiretaps; and (b) with
respect to unexpired wiretaps not having yet triggered s. 196 , on public policy
grounds that to answer the question would bar investigations under wiretap
authorizations and that the request was purely speculative. Veit J. again
refused to permit the respondent leave to call evidence, based on Dersch v.
Canada (Attorney General), supra, and the fact that some Charter 
breaches were so serious that a causal connection to the evidence need not be
established before a remedy will be granted. Lack of finality was not
considered a problem since R. v. Stinchcombe, supra, mandates
on-going disclosure. She then ordered a judicial stay of proceedings as a
remedy for failure to disclose the information.

 

Alberta Court of Appeal (1993), 145 A.R. 153

 

17               On November 4, 1993, Stratton
J.A., writing for the Alberta Court of Appeal, set aside both the disclosure
order and the stay of proceedings, and ordered a new trial. Since he found that
Veit J. did not have the discretion to make the disclosure order, he did not
deal with the issues surrounding the stay of proceedings.

 

18               Stratton J.A. stated that Crown
Counsel's assertion of ""no relevance"" was prima facie
determinative. The Crown need not disclose what is clearly irrelevant to the
accused's right to make full answer and defence (at p. 157):

 

Where
the Crown's statement of no relevance is challenged by an accused, the accused
must establish a reasonable possibility that the accused's right to make full
answer and defence will be impaired.

 

While noting that there may be cases
involving pure questions of law, where a factual basis is not needed to support
a contention of non-disclosure, this case required a factual basis. The court
did note the limits to Crown disclosure suggested by R. v. Stinchcombe, supra,
at p. 339, that ""[w]hile the Crown must err on the side of inclusion, it
need not produce what is clearly irrelevant"". Yet, Stratton J.A. stated,
at p. 158, that ""[t]here must be some evidence adduced which gives an air
of reality to what is otherwise pure speculation"". Given the cases cited
in support of this principle, R. v. Roach (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 262
(Alta. C.A.), and R. v. Simon (1992), 54 O.A.C. 398 (C.A.), Stratton
J.A. appeared to be imposing an evidentiary burden on the accused to bring
forth enough evidence to put in issue a reasonable possibility that the
accused's right to make full answer and defence will be impaired. The accuseds'
assertion (at p. 159) of ""a theoretical possibility founded only upon the
conjecture of defence counsel"" of relevance was ""not sufficient""
to trigger the Stinchcombe disclosure obligations. Furthermore, Stratton
J.A. distinguished the Dersch ""Catch-22"" situation from this
appeal on the basis that in that case, there had been notice the Crown intended
to introduce derivative evidence from wiretaps, thus establishing an
evidentiary foundation. In contrast, this appeal was pure speculation in that
it sought the disclosure of hypothetical material. Accordingly, Stratton J.A.
allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

 

19               In obiter, Stratton J.A.
also stated that if the appellants had actually invested their assertions with
an air of reality, the trial judge would have denied the Crown its right to
adjudicative fairness in not permitting an opportunity to call evidence to
attempt to justify its disclosure refusal. Stratton J.A. did not address the
intervener's alternative submission that non-disclosure was justified on the
basis of public interest privilege.

 

Analysis

 

General Crown Obligation to Disclose
Information

 

20               The rationale behind the Crown's
disclosure obligation stems from s. 7  of the Charter  reflecting, as
this Court stated in R. v. Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 336:

 

. .
. the overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the ability of the
accused to make full answer and defence. This common law right has acquired new
vigour by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  as one of the principles of fundamental
justice. . . . The right to make full answer and defence is one
of the pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure that
the innocent are not convicted.

 

This underlying principle shapes the
limits of disclosure.

 

21               This Court has clearly established
that the Crown is under a general duty to disclose all information,
whether inculpatory or exculpatory, except evidence that is beyond the control
of the prosecution, clearly irrelevant, or privileged: R. v. Stinchcombe,
supra, at p. 339; R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451. The Crown
obligation to disclose all relevant and non-privileged evidence, whether
favourable or unfavourable, to the accused requires that the Crown exercise the
utmost good faith in determining which information must be disclosed and in
providing ongoing disclosure. Failure to comply with this initial and
continuing obligation to disclose relevant and non-privileged evidence may
result in a stay of proceedings or other redress against the Crown, and may
constitute a serious breach of ethical standards. With respect to the latter,
of necessity, great reliance must be placed on the integrity of the police and
prosecution bar to act in the utmost good faith. It is for this reason that
departures from this onerous obligation are treated as very serious breaches of
professional ethics.

 

22               Nonetheless, the Crown's
obligation to disclose is not absolute (R. v. Stinchcombe, supra,
at p. 339):

 

While
the Crown must err on the side of inclusion, it need not produce what is
clearly irrelevant.

 

Relevance is determined in relation to
its use by the defence (at p. 340):

 

                   The
trial judge on a review should be guided by the general principle that
information ought not to be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility that
the withholding of information will impair the right of the accused to make
full answer and defence, unless the non-disclosure is justified by the law of
privilege.

 

As further summarized in R. v.
Egger, supra, at pp. 466-67:

 

                   The
Crown's disclosure obligation is subject to a discretion, the burden of justifying
the exercise of which lies on the Crown, to withhold information which is
clearly irrelevant or the nondisclosure of which is required by the rules of
privilege, or to delay the disclosure of information out of the necessity to
protect witnesses or complete an investigation: Stinchcombe, supra,
at pp. 335-36, 339-40. As was said in Stinchcombe, supra, at p.
340, ""(i)nasmuch as disclosure of all relevant information is the general
rule, the Crown must bring itself within an exception to that rule"".

 

                                                                    ...

 

One
measure of the relevance of information in the Crown's hands is its usefulness
to the defence: if it is of some use, it is relevant and should be disclosed — Stinchcombe,
supra, at p. 345. This requires a determination by the reviewing judge
that production of the information can reasonably be used by the accused either
in meeting the case for the Crown, advancing a defence or otherwise in making a
decision which may affect the conduct of the defence such as, for example,
whether to call evidence.

 

23               When the Crown alleges that it has
discharged its obligation to disclose, an issue may arise as to whether
disclosure is complete in two situations:

 

(1)the
defence contends that material that has been identified and is in existence
ought to have been produced; or

 

                   (2)the
defence contends that that material whose existence is in dispute ought to have
been produced.

 

24               I will deal with each of these
situations.

 

Procedure Where Existence of
Information is Established

 

25               In situations in which the
existence of certain information has been identified, then the Crown must
justify non-disclosure by demonstrating either that the information sought is
beyond its control, or that it is clearly irrelevant or privileged. The trial
judge must afford the Crown an opportunity to call evidence to justify such
allegation of non-disclosure. As noted in R. v. Stinchcombe, supra,
at p. 341:

 

This
may require not only submissions but the inspection of statements and other
documents and indeed, in some cases, viva voce evidence. A voir dire
will frequently be the appropriate procedure in which to deal with these
matters.

 

Justification of non-disclosure on the
grounds of public interest privilege or other privilege may involve certain
special procedures such as the procedure referred to in s. 37(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 , to protect the confidentiality of the
evidence.

 

26               An example of a case where the
existence of the information was not in issue, but its relevance disputed was R.
v. Hutter (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 81 (Ont. C.A.). Dubin C.J., writing for
the court, held at p. 89 that the Crown was required to disclose information in
its possession concerning the accused's bad character, even though that
evidence could only be used in rebuttal by the Crown:

 

                   The
information in the hands of the Crown with respect to the character of the
appellant could ""reasonably be used by the accused in advancing a defence
in making a decision which could affect the conduct of the defence such as, for
example, whether to call evidence"".

 

27               In wiretap cases, the existence of
wiretaps (unlike the case at bar) is usually not in issue. In Dersch, supra,
for example, the accuseds had been given notice that the Crown intended to adduce
evidence obtained as a result of Criminal Code  wiretap authorizations
made as part of the investigations into the charges being tried. The accuseds
applied for an order for access to the contents of the sealed packets
containing the affidavits in support of the authorizations, claiming that they
were needed for them to make full answer and defence. In restoring the order of
the trial judge to grant the application, this Court noted that the accuseds
could not gain access to the affidavit unless they could prove the grounds for
such access, and could not prove such grounds unless they had access. The
significant and distinguishing feature of that case, however, from this appeal
is that the existence of the wiretap in relation to the charges being
tried was never in doubt.

 

28               Another example of this type of
case where the existence of wiretaps was not in issue was R. v. Durette,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 469. In that case, the accused persons were charged with
conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine after extensive police investigations.
Significantly, the nature of the investigation suggested that the police had
used wiretaps. The defence sought disclosure of the sealed wiretap
authorization affidavit packet, which the trial judge had edited after
receiving suggestions from the Crown. The majority in this Court held that the
defence had a right to the unedited contents of the packet, and the decision
narrowly focused on the disclosure of wiretap authorization affidavits.

 

29               Other lower court decisions have
similarly involved factual situations where the fact of the interception of
communications has not been in issue. For example, in R. v. Desjardins (No.
5) (1991), 88 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 149 (Nfld. S.C.T.D.), the Charter 
right to counsel was alleged to have been violated by the interception of
solicitor-client communications. These allegations were similar to the
allegations made by the defence in this appeal. Significantly, in that case,
there was no issue concerning the interception of communications as defence
counsel had established that a bugging device had been found (at
pp. 155-56).

 

Procedure Where Existence of Material
is Disputed

 

30               In contrast to the above, in some
cases, this being one, the existence of material which is alleged to be
relevant is disputed by the Crown. Once the Crown alleges that it has fulfilled
its obligation to produce it cannot be required to justify the non-disclosure
of material the existence of which it is unaware or denies. Before anything
further is required of the Crown, therefore, the defence must establish a basis
which could enable the presiding judge to conclude that there is in existence
further material which is potentially relevant. Relevance means that there is a
reasonable possibility of being useful to the accused in making full answer and
defence. The existence of the disputed material must be sufficiently identified
not only to reveal its nature but also to enable the presiding judge to
determine that it may meet the test with respect to material which the Crown is
obliged to produce as set out above in the passages which I have quoted from R.
v. Stinchcombe and R. v. Egger, supra. 

 

31               Although the obligation cast upon
the defence which I have characterized as ""a basis"" is in the nature
of an evidentiary burden, I prefer not to call it that because it can, and in
many cases will, be discharged not by leading or pointing to evidence but by
oral submissions of counsel without the necessity of a voir dire.
Accordingly, I avoid the terms ""air of reality"" or ""live
issue"" and other terms used in some of the cases that are more appropriate
when used to describe a true evidentiary burden. Viva voce evidence and
a voir dire may, however, be required in situations in which the
presiding judge cannot resolve the matter on the basis of the submissions of
counsel.

 

32               Apart from its practical necessity
in advancing the debate to which I refer above, the requirement that the
defence provide a basis for its demand for further production serves to
preclude speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and
time-consuming disclosure requests. In cases involving wiretaps, such as this
appeal, this is particularly important. Fishing expeditions and conjecture must
be separated from legitimate requests for disclosure. Routine disclosure of the
existence of wiretaps in relation to a particular accused who has been charged,
but who is the subject of wiretaps for ongoing criminal investigations in
relation to other suspected offences, would impede the ability of the state to
investigate a broad array of sophisticated crimes which are otherwise difficult
to detect, such as drug-trafficking, extortion, fraud and insider trading: R.
v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 44. Wiretaps are generally only
effective if their existence is unknown to the persons under investigation.
This is implicitly recognized in the secrecy provisions of Part VI of the Code,
s. 187 and s. 193 which govern until the investigation expires, and
the deferred notification of the existence of a wiretap by s. 196 .

 

33               If the defence establishes a basis
in accordance with its obligation in that regard as outlined above, the Crown
must then justify a continuing refusal to disclose. The obligation of the Crown
is the same as its obligation in first instance which is defined in R. v.
Stinchcombe, supra, and elaborated in R. v. Egger, supra.
Generally, if the matter cannot be resolved without viva voce evidence,
the Crown must be afforded an opportunity to call relevant evidence. In cases
involving confidential information, it may be appropriate for the trial judge
to order a hearing in camera or to inspect the material in issue
privately, applying procedures such as those set out in s. 37(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . In cases involving wiretaps, the procedure for protecting
confidential information is dealt with in R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1460.

 

Disposition

 

34               Applying the foregoing to this
appeal, I am of the opinion that the accuseds failed at trial to establish a
basis for the existence of wiretap authorizations or evidence derived therefrom
which is potentially relevant to making full answer and defence.

 

35               The critical fact here is that the
Crown stated that no wiretaps had been authorized as part of the investigation
leading to the charges, making this appeal fundamentally different than the
situation in Dersch v. Canada (Attorney general), supra, where
wiretaps in relation to the charges being tried were known to have existed. It
is also different from R. v. Durette, supra, where the Crown
relied primarily upon wiretap and derivative wiretap evidence. In those two
cases, a denial of access to the wiretap authorizations could have clearly
impaired the accused's ability to make full answer and defence. Reference to
the possible existence of other wiretaps and their connection to the issues in
this appeal, however, is purely speculative and mere conjecture. In sum, it is
at best, a fishing expedition, and worst, an attempt to determine whether the
police have investigated the accused persons in relation to other suspected
offences. The appellants provided no basis for believing that there were
wiretap authorizations even in existence in relation to investigation of other
charges, or that the Crown had relied upon such wiretaps or derivative evidence
therefrom in preparing its case. In the circumstances, the Crown was not called
upon to justify further the position it had taken and there was no need for
further evidence. Nonetheless, on the basis of the view of the matter taken by
the trial judge which required the Crown to justify its position, the refusal
to permit the Crown to call evidence was, with respect, in error.

the Alberta Court of Appeal is thus dismissed.

on appeal from
the court of appeal for ontario

 

Criminal law ‑‑ Defences ‑‑ Self‑defence
‑‑ Accused charged with second degree murder after stabbing
deceased in what he claimed was an act of self‑defence ‑‑
Trial judge instructing jury that words ""without having provoked the
assault"" should be read into s. 34(2) of Criminal Code ‑‑
Whether self‑defence as defined in s. 34(2)  is available to initial
aggressors ‑‑ Whether s. 37 outlining basic principles of self‑defence
should have been put to jury ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C‑46 , ss. 34(1) , (2) , 35 , 37 .

 








The accused, a disc jockey, had given the deceased, who lived in the
same neighbourhood, some sound equipment to repair.  Over the next eight months
the accused made several attempts to retrieve his equipment, but the deceased
actively avoided him.  On the day of the killing, the accused's girlfriend saw
the deceased working outside and informed the accused.  The accused obtained a
kitchen knife and approached the deceased.  Words were exchanged.  According to
the accused, the deceased pushed him, and a struggle ensued.  Then the deceased
picked up a dolly, raised it to head level, and came at the accused.  The
accused reacted by stabbing the deceased with the kitchen knife.  At his trial
on a charge of second degree murder the accused took the position that the stabbing
of the deceased was an act of self‑defence.  The trial judge instructed
the jury, however, that the words ""without having provoked the
assault"", which appear in the self‑defence provision in
s. 34(1)  of the Criminal Code , should be read into s. 34(2) ,
which provides for a self‑defence justification for an aggressor who
causes death or grievous bodily harm.  The accused was convicted of
manslaughter.  The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial.  This appeal is to determine (1) whether the trial judge erred in
holding that the self‑defence justification in s. 34(2)  is not
available where an accused is an initial aggressor, and (2) whether he should
have left s. 37 , which contains a general statement of the principle of
self‑defence, with the jury.

 

Held (La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal
should be dismissed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  Section 34(2)  is clear on its face and is
available to an initial aggressor.  While s. 34(1) includes the statement
""without having provoked the assault"", s. 34(2)  does not.  A
contextual approach to statutory interpretation lends no support to the
position that these words should be read into s. 34(2) .  If Parliament's
intention is to be implied from its legislative actions, then there is a
compelling argument that Parliament intended s. 34(2)  to be available to
initial aggressors, since it could have included a non‑provocation
requirement in the provision.  As well, the contextual approach does not
generally mandate the courts to read words into a statutory provision.  To do
so would be tantamount to amending the provision, which is a legislative and
not a judicial function.  Finally, it is a principle of statutory
interpretation that where two interpretations of a provision which affects the
liberty of a subject are available, one of which is more favourable to an
accused, then the court should adopt this favourable interpretation.  Section
34(2) , on its face, is available to the accused.  It was an error for the trial
judge to narrow the provision in order to preclude the accused from relying on
it.

 








Where a provision is enacted by the legislature by the use of clear
and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, it must be enforced
however harsh or absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be.  The
fact that a provision gives rise to absurd results is not sufficient to declare
it ambiguous and then embark upon a broad‑ranging interpretive analysis. 
Only where a statutory provision is ambiguous, and therefore reasonably open to
two interpretations, will the absurd results flowing from one of the available
interpretations justify rejecting it in favour of the other.  Further, even
assuming that absurdity by itself is sufficient to create ambiguity, a literal
interpretation of s. 34(2) is still to be preferred.  The Criminal Code 
has a direct and potentially profound impact on the personal liberty of
citizens, and thus requires an interpretive approach which is sensitive to
liberty interests.  An ambiguous penal provision must therefore be interpreted
in the manner most favourable to accused persons, and in the manner most likely
to provide clarity and certainty in the criminal law.  Here s. 34(2)
applies on its face to initial aggressors, and is therefore open to such an
interpretation.  This interpretation is more favourable to accused persons than
the alternative advanced by the Crown, and is consistent with the clear wording
of s. 34(2) , thus providing certainty for citizens.

 

While Parliament's intention in enacting s. 37  is unclear, at
the very least the provision must serve a gap‑filling role, providing the
basis for self‑defence where ss. 34  and 35  are not applicable. 
Since the accused has been unable to advance a scenario under which s. 34
as interpreted here and s. 35  would not afford him a defence, there
appears to be no room left for s. 37  in this case.

 








Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  The trial judge did not err in
limiting s. 34(2) to unprovoked assaults in his instructions to the jury. 
The point of departure for statutory interpretation is not the ""plain
meaning"" of the words, but the intention of the legislature.  Since the
words of s. 34(2), taken alone, do not provide a clear and conclusive
indication of Parliament's intention, it is necessary to look further to the
history of the section and the practical problems and absurdities which may
result from interpreting the section one way or the other.  Self‑defence
at common law rested on a fundamental distinction:  where the killer had not
provoked the aggression the homicide was called ""justifiable
homicide"", and where he had provoked the aggression it was called
""excusable homicide"".  In the case of justifiable homicide the killer
could stand his ground and was not obliged to retreat in order to rely on the
defence of self‑defence.  In the case of excusable homicide, on the other
hand, the killer must have retreated as far as possible in attempting to escape
the threat which necessitated homicide, before he could claim self‑defence. 
These two situations were codified in the first Criminal Code  in 1892. 
Under s. 45, the predecessor of s. 34 , an accused who had not
provoked the assault was a person ""unlawfully assaulted""; he was
entitled to stand his ground and need not retreat.  This provision was later
divided into two subsections and the phrase ""so assaulted"" in the
second subsection, which had referred back to the phrase ""unlawfully
assaulted, not having provoked such assault"", was subsequently replaced by
""unlawfully assaulted"".  The need to insert the modifying phrase
""not having provoked such assault"" in the newly worded subsection was
most likely overlooked.  The marginal notes accompanying ss. 34  and 35 ,
Parliament's retention of the phrase ""unlawfully assaulted"" in both
s. 34(1)  and s. 34(2)  and the fact that neither s. 34(1)  nor
s. 34(2)  imposes a duty to retreat support the view that the omission was
inadvertent and that Parliament continued to intend that s. 34  would apply
to unprovoked assaults and s. 35  to provoked assaults.  If the word
""unlawful"" is given its proper meaning, it is unnecessary to read
anything into s. 34(2)  to conclude that it does not apply to provoked
assaults.  Alternatively, if it were necessary to read in the phrase
""without having provoked the assault"", this would be justified.  Policy
considerations support this interpretation.  People who provoke attacks must
know that a response, even if it is life‑threatening, will not entitle
them to stand their ground and kill.  Rather, they must retreat.

 

Since ss. 34 and 35 exclusively dictate the application of the
principles laid out in s. 37  where death or grievous bodily harm has
occurred, the trial judge was correct in declining to leave s. 37  to the
jury.

I.  Factual
Background

 

1                 On February
7, 1991, Basile Hudson, who made his living repairing appliances and electronic
equipment, was stabbed to death by the respondent.  The circumstances
surrounding Hudson's death arose during the summer of 1990 when the respondent,
a 26-year-old man, was working as a disc jockey.  He gave the deceased, who
lived in the same neighbourhood, an amplifier and other equipment to repair. 
Over the next eight months, the respondent made several attempts to retrieve
his equipment, but the deceased actively avoided him.  On one occasion, the
respondent, armed with a knife, confronted the deceased and told him he would
""get him"" if the equipment was not returned.  On another occasion,
the deceased fled through the back exit of his home when the respondent appeared
at the front door.

 








2                 On the day
of the killing, the respondent's girlfriend saw the deceased working outside
and informed the respondent.  The respondent obtained a kitchen knife and
approached the deceased.  Words were exchanged.  The respondent testified that
he told the deceased, ""Get my fucking amp because I need it.  Go suck your
mother and bring my fucking amp.""   According to the respondent, the
deceased pushed him, and a struggle ensued.  Then the deceased picked up a
dolly, raised it to head level, and came at the respondent.  The respondent
reacted by stabbing the deceased with the kitchen knife.   He then threw the
knife down and fled the scene.  Later that day, after consulting with a lawyer,
the respondent turned himself in.

 

3                 On November
25, 1991, the respondent appeared in the Ontario Court (General Division)
before Moldaver J. and a jury on a charge of second degree murder.  He entered
a plea of not guilty, and took the position at trial that the stabbing of the
deceased was an act of self-defence.  The jury found the respondent guilty of
the lesser and included offence of manslaughter.  He was sentenced to two and
one-half years' imprisonment.

 

4                 The
respondent appealed his conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal on the ground
that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that s. 34(2)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , was not applicable in the event they found
that the respondent had been the initial aggressor, having provoked the
deceased.  The Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal, set aside the
conviction and ordered a new trial: (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 450, 84 C.C.C. (3d)
473, 24 C.R. (4th) 265, 65 O.A.C. 199.

 

5                 The Crown
now appeals to this Court, arguing that the Ontario Court of Appeal erred when
it reached the conclusion that self-defence as defined in s. 34(2)  of the Criminal
Code  is available to accused persons who are initial aggressors.

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 








 

                                                      Defence
of Person

 

34. (1) Every one who
is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in
repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or
grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.

 

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted and who
causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if

 

(a) he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or
grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally
made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and

 

(b) he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot
otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.

 

35. Every one who has
without justification assaulted another but did not commence the assault with
intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm, or has without justification
provoked an assault on himself by another, may justify the use of force
subsequent to the assault if

 

(a) he uses the force

 

(i) under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm
from the violence of the person whom he has assaulted or provoked, and

 

(ii) in the belief, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary in
order to preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm;

 

(b) he did not, at any time before the necessity of
preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm arose, endeavour to cause
death or grievous bodily harm; and

 

(c) he declined further conflict and quitted or retreated
from it as far as it was feasible to do so before the necessity of preserving
himself from death or grievous bodily harm arose.

 

36. Provocation
includes, for the purposes of sections 34 and 35, provocation by blows, words
or gestures.

 

37. (1) Every one is
justified in using force to defend himself or any one under his protection from
assault, if he uses no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or
the repetition of it.

 

(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to justify
the wilful infliction of any hurt or mischief that is excessive, having regard
to the nature of the assault that the force used was intended to prevent.

 

 








III.  Decisions
Below

 

A. Ontario
Court, General Division

 

6                 Moldaver J.
first charged the jury with respect to self-defence under s. 34(1) , and then
turned to the application of s. 34(2) .  The portion of the charge with respect
to s. 34(2)  which the Court of Appeal found to be in error is the following:

 

Moving on from there, you will notice, ladies and
gentlemen, that the words ""without having provoked the assault"",
which we saw in s. 34(1) , do not appear in s. 34(2) .  If you take a look
on your paper and you look at 34(1), you will see the words ""without
having provoked the assault"".  You will not see those words in s. 34(2) .

 

However, as a matter of law, I direct you that those
words are to be read into s. 34(2) .  You will see the reason for this when we
deal with s. 35, but for the present time you must accept that the words
""without having provoked the assault"" are to be read into s. 34(2) .

 

 

 

7                 Moldaver J.
then charged the jury with respect to s. 35.  After reading s. 35 to the jury,
Moldaver J. stated:

 

Now, for the purposes of this case, ladies and
gentlemen, this section relates to a situation where the accused has, without
justification, provoked an assault upon himself.  It defines the nature and
scope of the force which a person may use to defend himself after he has provoked
an assault upon himself and the steps he must take before the force used in
response can be justified.

 

 

 

B. Ontario
Court of Appeal 

 

 

 








8                 Austin J.A.
(Goodman and McKinlay JJ.A. concurring) considered two issues: (1) was the
trial judge in error in reading the words ""without having provoked the
assault"" into s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code ?; and (2) was the trial
judge in error in not leaving s. 37  to the jury as a basis on which they could
have found that the respondent was acting in self-defence?

 

9                 In resolving
the first issue, Austin J.A. felt that it was unnecessary to consider the
history of s. 34, principles of statutory interpretation, the law in other
jurisdictions, and the views of academics.  Instead, the focus should be on the
structure of s. 34, and Canadian jurisprudence.  In Austin J.A.'s view, the
problem with s. 34(2)  (i.e., that it does not include the words ""without
having provoked the assault"", whereas s. 34(1)  does) has been apparent
from the very first Criminal Code  provisions dating from 1892.  For this
reason, legislative history did not resolve the problem.

 

10               Austin J.A.
then considered the relevant case law.  The Crown relied on the following cases
for the proposition that ""without having provoked the assault"" should
be read into the provision:  R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96
(Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bolyantu (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 174 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Merson (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 251 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Chamberland
(1988), 96 A.R. 1 (C.A.).  The respondent relied on the following cases to
support his position that provocation is irrelevant to s. 34(2) : R. v.
Stubbs (1988), 28 O.A.C. 14 (C.A.); R. v. Nelson (1992), 71 C.C.C.
(3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.).

 








11               Austin J.A.
determined that the cases relied on by the Crown did not directly confront the
issue he had to consider, and were ""broad brush"" statements
concerning the interrelationship between ss. 34  and 35  of the Criminal Code . 
In contrast, the issue was addressed in the two cases on which the respondent
relied.  In both of those cases, the Ontario Court of Appeal had concluded that
provocation is not relevant to s. 34(2) .  These cases, in his opinion, were
conclusive.

 

12               Austin J.A.
then turned to the second issue.  He disagreed with the respondent that s. 37 
of the Criminal Code  should be put to the jury in every case where
self-defence might arise.  He noted that counsel for the respondent had been
invited to suggest a scenario which would not be covered by ss. 34  and 35 , and
which might therefore be covered by s. 37 .  No scenario was put forward.  There
was therefore no basis on which s. 37  could have been put to the jury.

 

13               As a result,
the court set aside the respondent's conviction and ordered a new trial.

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A.  Introduction

 

14               This case
raises a question of pure statutory interpretation:  Is the self-defence
justification in s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code  available where an
accused is an initial aggressor, having provoked the assault against which he
claims to have defended himself?  The trial judge, Moldaver J., construed s.
34(2)  as not applying in such a circumstance.  The Ontario Court of Appeal
disagreed.

 








15               The conflict
between ss. 34  and 35  is obvious on the face of the provisions.  Section 34(1) 
begins with the statement, ""Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without
having provoked the assault . . ."".  In contrast, s. 34(2)  begins,
""Every one who is unlawfully assaulted . . ."".  Missing from s. 34(2) 
is any reference to the condition, ""without having provoked the assault"". 
The fact that there is no non-provocation requirement in s. 34(2)  becomes
important when one refers to s. 35 , which explicitly applies where an accused
has ""without justification provoked an assault . . ."".  Therefore,
both ss. 34(2)  and 35  appear to be available to initial aggressors.  Hence, the
issue arises in this case of whether the respondent, as an initial aggressor
raising self-defence, may avail himself of s. 34(2) , or should be required
instead to meet the more onerous conditions of s. 35 .

 

16               As a
preliminary comment, I would observe that ss. 34  and 35  of the Criminal Code 
are highly technical, excessively detailed provisions deserving of much
criticism.  These provisions overlap, and are internally inconsistent in certain
respects.  Moreover, their relationship to s. 37  (as discussed below) is
unclear.  It is to be expected that trial judges may encounter difficulties in
explaining the provisions to a jury, and that jurors may find them confusing. 
The case at bar demonstrates this.  During counsel's objections to his charge
on ss. 34  and 35 , the trial judge commented, ""Well, it seems to me
these sections of the Criminal Code  are unbelievably confusing.""  I agree
with this observation.

 

17               Despite the
best efforts of counsel in the case at bar to reconcile ss. 34  and 35  in a
coherent manner, I am of the view that any interpretation which attempts to
make sense of the provisions will have some undesirable or illogical results. 
It is clear that legislative action is required to clarify the Criminal Code 's
self-defence regime.

 

B.                Did the trial judge err in
charging the jury that s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code is not available to an
initial aggressor?








 

(i)  Section 34(2) is not ambiguous

 

 18              In resolving the interpretive
issue raised by the Crown, I take as my starting point the proposition that
where no ambiguity arises on the face of a statutory provision, then its clear
words should be given effect.  This is another way of asserting what is
sometimes referred to as the ""golden rule"" of literal construction: a
statute should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of
its terms.  Where the language of the statute is plain and admits of only one
meaning, the task of interpretation does not arise (Maxwell on the
Interpretation of Statutes (12th ed. 1969), at p. 29).

 

19               While s.
34(1) includes the statement ""without having provoked the assault"",
s. 34(2) does not.  Section 34(2) is clear, and I fail to see how anyone could
conclude that it is, on its face, ambiguous in any way.  Therefore, taking s.
34(2) in isolation, it is clearly available to an initial aggressor.

 

20               The Crown has
asked this Court to read into s. 34(2) the words ""without having provoked
the assault"".  The Crown submits that by taking into consideration the
common law of self-defence, legislative history, related Criminal Code 
provisions, margin notes, and public policy, it becomes clear that Parliament
could not have intended s. 34(2)  to be available to initial aggressors. 
Parliament's failure to include the words ""without having provoked the
assault"" in s. 34(2)  was an oversight, which the Crown is asking this
Court to correct.

 








21               The Crown
labels its approach ""contextual"".  There is certainly support for a
""contextual approach"" to statutory interpretation.  Driedger, in Construction
of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), has stated the modern principle of contextual
construction as follows (at p. 87):

 

Today there is only one principle or approach, namely,
the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. . . . Lord Atkinson in Victoria
(City) v. Bishop of Vancouver Island, [1921] 2 A.C. 384,*
at p. 387, put it this way:

 

In the construction of statutes their words must be interpreted in
their ordinary grammatical sense, unless there be something in the context, or
in the object of the statute in which they occur, or in the circumstances with
reference to which they are used, to show that they were used in a special
sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense.

 

 

Driedger then
reduces the principle to five steps of construction (at p. 105):

 

 

1.  The Act as a whole is to be read in its entire context so as to
ascertain the intention of Parliament (the law as expressly or impliedly
enacted by the words), the object of the Act (the ends sought to be achieved),
and the scheme of the Act (the relation between the individual provisions of
the Act).

 

2. The words of the individual provisions to be applied to the
particular case under consideration are then to be read in their grammatical
and ordinary sense in the light of the intention of Parliament embodied in the
Act as a whole, the object of the Act and the scheme of the Act, and if they
are clear and unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme
and with the general body of the law, that is the end.

 

3. If the words are apparently obscure or ambiguous, then a meaning
that best accords with the intention of Parliament, the object of the Act and
the scheme of the Act, but one that the words are reasonably capable of
bearing, is to be given them.

 








4. If, notwithstanding that the words are clear and unambiguous when
read in their grammatical and ordinary sense, there is disharmony within the
statute, statutes in pari materia, or the general law, then an
unordinary meaning that will produce harmony is to be given the words, if
they are reasonably capable of bearing that meaning.

 

5. If obscurity, ambiguity or disharmony cannot be resolved
objectively by reference to the intention of Parliament, the object of the Act
or the scheme of the Act, then a meaning that appears to be the most reasonable
may be selected. [Emphasis added.] 

 

22               Certainly,
interpreting statutory provisions in context is a reasonable approach. 
However, a ""contextual approach"" lends no support to the Crown's
position.  First, the contextual approach takes as its starting point the
intention of the legislature.  However, given the confused nature of the Criminal
Code  provisions related to self-defence, I cannot imagine how one could
determine what Parliament's intention was in enacting the provisions.  
Therefore, it seems to me that in this case one is prevented from embarking on
a contextual analysis ab initio.

  

23               The Crown
argues that it was Parliament's intention that neither s. 34(1) nor s.
34(2) be available to initial aggressors, and that it was a mere oversight that
the words chosen in s. 34(2) do not give effect to this intention.  I would
have thought it would be equally persuasive to argue that Parliament intended
both ss. 34(1) and (2) to be available to initial aggressors, and that
Parliament's mistake was in including the words ""without having
provoked the assault"" in s. 34(1).

 

24               Parliament's
intention becomes even more cloudy when one refers to s. 45 of the 1892 Criminal
Code, S.C. 1892, c. 29, which was the forerunner of ss. 34(1) and 34(2):

 








45. Every one
unlawfully assaulted, not having provoked such assault, is justified in
repelling force by force, if the force he uses is not meant to cause death or
grievous bodily harm, and is no more than is necessary for the purpose of
self-defence; and every one so assaulted is justified, though he causes
death or grievous bodily harm, if he causes it under reasonable apprehension of
death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was
originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purpose, and if he
believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from
death or grievous bodily harm. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

There is a clear
ambiguity in this provision.  Does the expression ""every one so
assaulted"" refer to ""[e]very one unlawfully assaulted"", or to
""[e]very one unlawfully assaulted, not having provoked such
assault""?  This question is academic, since Parliament appears to have
resolved the ambiguity in its 1955 revision of the Criminal Code, S.C.
1953-54, c. 51.  The first part of the former s. 45 was renumbered s. 34(1),
and the second part became s. 34(2).  The new s. 34(2) omitted any reference to
a non-provocation requirement.

 

25               If
Parliament's intention is to be implied from its legislative actions, then
there is a compelling argument that Parliament intended s. 34(2) to be
available to initial aggressors.  When Parliament revised the Criminal Code 
in 1955, it could have included a provocation requirement in s. 34(2) .   The
result would then be similar to s. 48(2) of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961,
S.N.Z. 1961, No. 43 (repealed and substituted 1980, No. 63, s. 2 ) which was
virtually identical to s. 34(2)  save that it included an express non-provocation
requirement:

 

       48. . . .

(2) Every one unlawfully assaulted, not having
provoked the assault, is justified in repelling force by force although in
so doing he causes death or grievous bodily harm, if . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 








The fact that
Parliament did not choose this route is the best and only evidence we have of
legislative intention, and this evidence certainly does not support the Crown's
position.

 

26               Second, the
contextual approach allows the courts to depart from the common grammatical
meaning of words where this is required by a particular context, but it
does not generally mandate the courts to read words into a statutory
provision.  It is only when words are ""reasonably capable of bearing""
a particular meaning that they may be interpreted contextually.  I would agree
with Pierre-André Côté's observation in his book The Interpretation of
Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 231, that:

 

Since the judge's task is to interpret the statute,
not to create it, as a general rule, interpretation should not add to the terms
of the law.  Legislation is deemed to be well drafted, and to express
completely what the legislator wanted to say. . . .

 

 

The Crown is
asking this Court to read words into s. 34(2) which are simply not there.  In
my view, to do so would be tantamount to amending s. 34(2), which is a
legislative and not a judicial function.  The contextual approach provides no
basis for the courts to engage in legislative amendment.

 

27               Third, in
this case we cannot lose sight of the overriding principle governing the
interpretation of penal provisions.  In Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General
for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, Dickson J. (as he then was) stated the
principle as follows, at p. 115:

 

 








Even if I were to conclude that the relevant statutory
provisions were ambiguous and equivocal . . . I would have to find for the
appellant in this case.  It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of
clarity and certainty when freedom is at stake.  No authority is needed for the
proposition that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise,
in the construction and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a
subject, then that statute should be applied in such a manner as to favour the
person against whom it is sought to be enforced.

 

 

Section 34(2),
as a defence, acts as a ""subtraction"" from the liability which would
otherwise flow from the criminal offences contained in the Criminal Code . 
Criminal Code  provisions concerning offences and defences both serve to
define criminal culpability, and for this reason they must receive similar
interpretive treatment.

 

28               This
principle was eloquently stated by La Forest J.A. (as he then was) in New
Brunswick v. Estabrooks Pontiac Buick Ltd. (1982), 44 N.B.R. (2d) 201, at
p. 210:

 

There is no doubt that the duty of the courts is to
give effect to the intention of the Legislature as expressed in the words of
the statute.  And however reprehensible the result may appear, it is our duty
if the words are clear to give them effect.  This follows from the
constitutional doctrine of the supremacy of the Legislature when acting within
its legislative powers.  The fact that the words as interpreted would give an
unreasonable result, however, is certainly ground for the courts to scrutinize
a statute carefully to make abundantly certain that those words are not susceptible
of another interpretation.  For it should not be readily assumed that the
Legislature intends an unreasonable result or to perpetrate an injustice or
absurdity.

 

This scarcely means that the courts should attempt to
reframe statutes to suit their own individual notions of what is just or
reasonable.

 








29               It is a
principle of statutory interpretation that where two interpretations of a
provision which affects the liberty of a subject are available, one of which is
more favourable to an accused, then the court should adopt this favourable
interpretation.  By this same reasoning, where such a provision is, on its
face, favourable to an accused, then I do not think that a court should engage
in the interpretive process advocated by the Crown for the sole purpose of
narrowing the provision and making it less favourable to the accused.  Section
34(2), on its face, is available to the respondent.   It was, with respect, an
error for the trial judge to narrow the provision in order to preclude the
respondent from relying on it.

 

30               I therefore
conclude that s. 34(2) is not an ambiguous provision, and is available to an
initial aggressor.  I find myself in agreement with the Ontario Court of
Appeal, which has reached a similar conclusion in its rulings in Stubbs,
supra, and Nelson, supra, and in the case at bar.

 

(ii)   Even though s. 34(2) may give rise to absurd
results, the Crown's interpretation cannot be adopted

 

 

 

31               It is
important to reiterate that there is no ambiguity on the face of s. 34(2).  The
Crown's argument that the provision is ambiguous relies on legislative history,
the common law, public policy, margin notes, and the relationship between ss.
34  and 35 .  The Crown alleges that it would be absurd to make s. 34(2)
available to initial aggressors when s. 35  so clearly applies.   Parliament,
the Crown submits, could not have intended such an absurd result, and therefore
the provision cannot mean what it says.   Essentially, the Crown equates
absurdity with ambiguity.

 








32               The Crown
asks this Court to resolve the absurdity/ambiguity by narrowing s. 34(2) so
that it does not apply in the case of an initial aggressor.  If the Crown is
correct, then an initial aggressor could only rely on s. 35  of the Criminal
Code , which imposes more onerous requirements.  In particular, s. 35 (c)
only allows an initial aggressor to raise self-defence where

 

(c) he declined further conflict and quitted or retreated
from it as far as it was feasible to do so before the necessity of preserving
himself from death or grievous bodily harm arose.

 

 

 

33               The
respondent takes the position that if there is ambiguity, it must be resolved
in the manner most favourable to accused persons.  As a result, s. 34(2) must
be made available to initial aggressors.

 

34               I am of the
view that the Crown's argument linking absurdity to ambiguity cannot succeed. 
I would adopt the following proposition:  where, by the use of clear and
unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by the
legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to common
sense the result may be (Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, supra,
at p. 29).  The fact that a provision gives rise to absurd results is not, in
my opinion, sufficient to declare it ambiguous and then embark upon a
broad-ranging interpretive analysis.

 








35               In Altrincham
Electric Supply Ltd. v. Sale Urban District Council (1936), 154 L.T. 379
(H.L.), Lord Macmillan criticized the view that absurdity alone would justify
the rejection of a literal interpretation of a statutory provision.  He
emphasized that an ""absurdity approach"" is generally unworkable
because of the difficulty of developing criteria by which ""to judge
whether a particular enactment, if literally read, is so absurd that Parliament
cannot have intended it to be so read . . ."" (p. 388).  He then proceeded,
at p. 388, to outline what I believe to be the correct approach to statutory
interpretation where absurdity is alleged:

 

. . . if the language of an enactment is ambiguous and susceptible
of two meanings, one of which is consonant with justice and good sense while
the other would lead to extravagant results, a court of law will incline to
adopt the former and to reject the latter, even although the latter may correspond
more closely with the literal reading of the words employed.

 

 

36               Thus, only
where a statutory provision is ambiguous, and therefore reasonably open to two
interpretations, will the absurd results flowing from one of the available
interpretations justify rejecting it in favour of the other.   Absurdity is a
factor to consider in the interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, but
there is no distinct ""absurdity approach"".

 

37               However,
assuming for the moment that absurdity by itself is sufficient to create
ambiguity, thus justifying the application of the contextual analysis proposed
by the Crown, I would still prefer a literal interpretation of s. 34(2).

 

38               As stated
above, the overriding principle governing the interpretation of penal
provisions is that ambiguity should be resolved in a manner most favourable to
accused persons.  Moreover, in choosing between two possible interpretations, a
compelling consideration must be to give effect to the interpretation most
consistent with the terms of the provision.  As Dickson J. noted in Marcotte,
supra, when freedom is at stake, clarity and certainty are of fundamental
importance.  He continued, at p. 115:








If one is to be incarcerated, one should at least know that some Act
of Parliament requires it in express terms, and not, at most, by implication.

 

 

 

Under s. 19 of
the Criminal Code , ignorance of the law is no excuse to criminal
liability.  Our criminal justice system presumes that everyone knows the law.  
Yet we can hardly sustain such a presumption if courts adopt interpretations of
penal provisions which rely on the reading-in of words which do not appear on
the face of the provisions.  How can a citizen possibly know the law in such a
circumstance?

 

39               The Criminal
Code  is not a contract or a labour agreement.  For that matter, it is
qualitatively different from most other legislative enactments because of its
direct and potentially profound impact on the personal liberty of citizens. 
The special nature of the Criminal Code  requires an interpretive
approach which is sensitive to liberty interests.  Therefore, an ambiguous
penal provision must be interpreted in the manner most favourable to accused
persons, and in the manner most likely to provide clarity and certainty in the
criminal law.

 








40               I would agree
that some absurdity flows from giving effect to the terms of s. 34(2).  One is
struck, for example, by the fact that if s. 34(2) is available to an initial
aggressor who has killed or committed grievous bodily harm, then that accused
may be in a better position to raise self-defence than an initial aggressor
whose assault was less serious.  This is because the less serious aggressor
could not take advantage of the broader defence in s. 34(2), as that provision
is only available to an accused who ""causes death or grievous bodily
harm"".  Section 34(1) would not be available since it is explicitly
limited to those who have not provoked an assault.  Therefore, the less serious
aggressor could only have recourse to s. 35 , which imposes a retreat
requirement.  It is, in my opinion, anomalous that an accused who commits the
most serious act has the broadest defence.

 

41               Even though I
agree with the Crown that the interpretation of s. 34(2) which makes it
available to initial aggressors may be somewhat illogical in light of s. 35 ,
and may lead to some absurdity, I do not believe that such considerations
should lead this Court to narrow a statutory defence.  Parliament, after all,
has the right to legislate illogically (assuming that this does not raise
constitutional concerns).  And if Parliament is not satisfied with the judicial
application of its illogical enactments, then Parliament may amend them
accordingly.

 








42               What is most
important in this case is that s. 34(2) applies on its face to initial
aggressors, and is therefore open to such an interpretation.  This
interpretation is more favourable to accused persons than the alternative
advanced by the Crown.  Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the
clear wording of s. 34(2), thus providing certainty for citizens.  Although I
appreciate the efforts of the Crown to underscore the problems with the Criminal
Code 's self-defence regime through a broad historical, academic and
policy-based analysis, I suspect that very few citizens are equipped to engage
in this kind of interpretive approach.  Rare will be the citizen who will read
ss. 34  and 35 , and recognize the logical inconsistencies as between the two
provisions.  Rarer still will be the citizen who will read the provisions and
conclude that they are inconsistent with the common law, or with Parliament's
intention in 1892, or with margin notes.  Given that citizens have to live with
the Criminal Code , and with judicial interpretations of the provisions
of the Code, I am of the view that s. 34(2)  must be interpreted
according to its plain terms.  It is therefore available where an accused is an
initial aggressor, having provoked the assault against which he claims to have
defended himself.

 

C.  Section
37 of the Criminal Code

 

43               Before
concluding, I will briefly address the respondent's argument related to s. 37 
of the Criminal Code .  Section 37 , itself a distinct justification,
contains a general statement of the principle of self-defence:

 

37. (1)  Every one is
justified in using force to defend himself or any one under his protection from
assault, if he uses no more force than is necessary to prevent the assault or
the repetition of it.

 

(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to justify
the wilful infliction of any hurt or mischief that is excessive, having regard
to the nature of the assault that the force used was intended to prevent.

 

 

 

44               Section 37
adds to the confusion surrounding ss. 34  and 35 , since it appears to make the
self-defence justification available to an accused in any circumstance where
the force used by that accused was (i) necessary, and (ii) proportionate.  If
s. 37 is available to an initial aggressor (and there is no indication that it
is not), then it would appear to be in conflict with s. 35 . Moreover, it is
difficult to understand why Parliament would enact the specific and detailed
justifications in ss. 34  and 35 , yet then make available a broad justification
in s. 37 which appears to render ss. 34  and 35  redundant.

 








45               Although
Parliament's intention in enacting s. 37 is unclear, at the very least the
provision must serve a gap-filling role, providing the basis for self-defence
where ss. 34  and 35  are not applicable.  The respondent, though taking the
position that Moldaver J. erred in not putting s. 37 to the jury at his trial,
has been unable to advance a scenario under which ss. 34  (as interpreted above)
and 35 would not afford him a defence.  Therefore, there appears to be no room
left for s. 37 in this case.

 

46               The
respondent has suggested that s. 37 should be put to the jury in all cases
because it outlines the basic principles of self-defence, and this will be
helpful to the jury.  However, a trial judge can explain these principles
without resort to s. 37, since these principles form the foundation of ss. 34 
and 35 .

 

D.  Conclusion

 

47               With respect,
Moldaver J. erred in instructing the jury at the respondent's trial that s.
34(2) was not available to an initial aggressor.  I therefore am in agreement
with the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The appeal is dismissed, the respondent's
conviction set aside and a new trial.

Introduction

 








48               This case
raises the issue of whether a person who provokes another person to assault him
can rely on the defence of self-defence, notwithstanding the fact that he
failed to retreat from the assault he provoked.  The Chief Justice would answer
this question in the affirmative.  I, with respect, take a different view.

 

49               The accused
McIntosh was a disc jockey.  He had given some sound equipment to the deceased
to repair.  Over the next eight months, McIntosh tried to get the equipment,
without success.  On one occasion, McIntosh told the deceased he would
""get him"" if the equipment were not returned.  On another occasion,
the deceased fled though the back door when McIntosh appeared at his front
door.  On the day of the killing, McIntosh, armed with a kitchen knife, ordered
the deceased to return the equipment.  According to McIntosh, the deceased
responded by pushing him.  They struggled.  The deceased picked up a dolly,
raised it to head level, and came at the respondent.  McIntosh stabbed him,
threw the knife down, and fled.

 








50               It was open
to the jury to find, in this scenario, that McIntosh had provoked the assault
by threatening the deceased while armed with a knife.  This raised the question
of which of the self-defence provisions of the Criminal Code  apply to a
person who provokes the aggression that led to the killing.  The answer depends
on the interpretation accorded to ss. 34  and 35  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which codify self-defence in Canada.  Section 35  clearly
applies where the accused initiated the aggression; however, it contains a
requirement that the accused have attempted to retreat, and might not have
assisted McIntosh.  Sections 34(1)  and 34(2) , on the other hand, contain no
requirement to retreat.  Section 34(1)  clearly does not apply to the initial
aggressor.  The debate, in these circumstances, focused on s. 34(2) .  If
McIntosh could avail himself of s. 34(2) , he would be entitled to rely on
self-defence, notwithstanding findings that he provoked the fight and did not
retreat.

 

51               The trial
judge instructed the jury that s. 34(2) would not apply if they found that
McIntosh had provoked the fight in which he killed the deceased.  In his view,
only s. 35  was available to an initial aggressor.  The jury returned a verdict
of guilty of manslaughter.  McIntosh appealed on the ground that the trial
judge erred in telling the jury that s. 34(2) did not apply to the initial
aggressor.  The Court of Appeal agreed and ordered a new trial: (1993), 15 O.R.
(3d) 450, 84 C.C.C. (3d) 473, 24 C.R. (4th) 265, 65 O.A.C. 199.  The Crown now
appeals to this Court, arguing that the trial judge correctly instructed the
jury that s. 34(2) is not available to persons who provoke the attack which led
to the killing.

 

52               A second
issue arose with respect to s. 37  of the Criminal Code .  The trial judge
declined to put it to the jury, on the ground that counsel had not indicated
how it could be applied to the evidence in the case.  The Court of Appeal
agreed.

 

Analysis

 

1.                Does Section 34(2) of the
Criminal Code Apply to a Person Who Provokes an Attack?

 








53               McIntosh
raises one main argument.  It is this.  Section 34(1) states expressly that it
does not apply to people who have provoked the assault from which they defended
themselves. Section 34(2), by contrast, does not expressly exclude provokers. 
Therefore, s. 34(2) must be read as applying to people who have provoked the
assault from which they defended themselves.  In order to prevent s. 34(2) from
applying to initial aggressors, it would be necessary to ""read in"" to
s. 34(2) the phrase found in s. 34(1): ""without having provoked the
assault"".  On this basis, it is argued that the provisions contain no
ambiguity.  It is further argued that even if they did contain an ambiguity, it
must be resolved in favour of the accused, following the principle that an ambiguity
in penal provisions should be resolved in the manner most favourable to accused
persons.

 

54               Section
34(1), as mentioned, contains the phrase ""without having provoked the
assault"".  It reads:

 









 
  
  Self-defence against unprovoked assault
  
  
   
  
  
  34.  (1) Every one
  who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified
  in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause
  death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him
  to defend himself. 
  
 









 

55               Section
34(2), on the other hand, contains no such phrase.  It reads:

 









 
  
  Extent of justification
  
  
   
  
  
  (2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted and who
  causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if
   
             (a) he causes
  it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the
  violence  with which the assault was originally made or with which the
  assailant pursues his purposes; and
   
  (b) he believes, on reasonable grounds, that
  he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
 









56       Section
35 specifically refers to initial aggressors or provocateurs.  It reads:

 














 
  
  Self-defence in case of aggression
  
  
   
  
  
  35.  Every one who
  has without justification assaulted another but did not commence the assault
  with intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm, or has without
  justification provoked an assault on himself by another, may justify the use
  of force subsequent to the assault if
   
  (a) he uses the force
   
  (i) under reasonable apprehension of death or
  grievous bodily harm from the violence of the person whom he has assaulted or
  provoked, and 
   
  (ii) in the belief, on reasonable grounds, that it
  is necessary in order to preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm;
   
  (b) he did not, at any time before the
  necessity of preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm arose,
  endeavour to cause death or grievous bodily harm; and
   
  (c) he declined further conflict and quitted
  or retreated from it as far as it was feasible to do so before the necessity
  of preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm arose.
  
 









 

57               At
first blush the argument seems attractive that the absence of the phrase
""without having provoked the assault"" in s. 34(2) makes it applicable
to all cases of self-defence, even those where the accused provoked the
attack.  Yet, a closer look at the language, history and policy of ss. 34  and
35  of the Criminal Code  suggests that this argument should not prevail.

 








58               The
Chief Justice starts from the premise that ""the language of the statute is
plain and admits of only one meaning"" (p. 697).   From this he concludes
that ""the task of interpretation does not arise"" (p. 697).  I cannot
agree.  First, the language is not, with respect, plain.  The facial ambiguity
of s. 34(2) is amply attested by the different interpretations which it has
been given by different courts.  But even if the words were plain, the task of
interpretation cannot be avoided.  As Driedger on the Construction of
Statutes (3rd ed. 1994) puts it at p. 4, ""no modern court would
consider it appropriate to adopt that meaning, however ""plain"",
without first going through the work of interpretation"".   

 

59               The
point of departure for interpretation is not the ""plain meaning"" of
the words, but the intention of the legislature.  The classic statement of the
""plain meaning"" rule, in the Sussex Peerage Case (1844), 11 C.
& F. 85, 8 E.R. 1034 (H.L.), at p. 1057, makes this clear: ""the only
rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is, that they should be
construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the
Act"".  To quote Driedger, supra, at p. 3: ""The purpose
of the legislation must be taken into account, even where the meaning appears
to be clear, and so must the consequences.""  As Lamer C.J. put it in R.
v. Z. (D.A.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 1025, at p. 1042: ""the express words
used by Parliament must be interpreted not only in their ordinary sense but
also in the context of the scheme and purpose of the legislation"".  The
plain meaning of the words, if such exists, is a secondary interpretative
principle aimed at discerning the intention of the legislator.  If the words
admit of only one meaning, they may indeed ""best declare the intention of
the lawgiver"" as suggested in the Sussex Peerage Case at p. 1057,
but even here it is the intention, and not the ""plain meaning"", which
is conclusive.  But if, as in the case of s. 34(2), the words permit of doubt
as to the intention of Parliament, other matters must be looked to to determine
that intention. 

 








60               I
also depart from the Chief Justice on his application of the proposition that
""where two interpretations of a provision which affects the liberty of a
subject are available, one of which is more favourable to an accused, then the
court should adopt this favourable interpretation"" (p. 702).  This Court
in Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108,
at p. 115, made it clear that this rule of construction applies only where
""real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise"" (per
Dickson J. (as he then was)).  If the intention of Parliament can be
ascertained with reasonable precision, the rule has no place.  As
La Forest J. put it in R. v. Deruelle, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 663, at pp.
676-77:

 

In the court below, the majority
suggested that any ambiguity in a penal provision should be resolved in favour
of the accused. . . . While it is true that s. 254(3) is not a model of
clarity, in this instance the intent of Parliament is sufficiently clear that
there is no need for the aid of that canon of statutory construction.

 

61               In
summary, then, I take the view that this Court cannot evade the task of
interpreting s. 34(2).  The Court's task is to determine the intention of
Parliament.  The words of the section, taken alone, do not provide a clear and
conclusive indication of Parliament's intention.  It is therefore necessary to
look further to determine Parliament's intention to the history of the section
and the practical problems and absurdities which may result from interpreting
the section one way or the other.  These considerations lead, in my respectful
view, to the inescapable conclusion that Parliament intended s. 34(2) to apply
only to unprovoked assaults.  This in turn leads to the conclusion that the
trial judge was correct in declining to leave s. 34(2) with the jury. 

 

The History of Section 34(2)

 








62               Self-defence
at common law rested on a fundamental distinction between cases where no fault
was attributable to the killer, and cases where the killing was partly induced
by some fault of the killer.  Where the killer was not at fault -- that is
where he had not provoked the aggression -- the homicide was called
""justifiable homicide"".  Where blame could be laid on the killer, as
where he had provoked the aggression, on the other hand, the homicide was called
""excusable homicide"".  (See E. H. East,  A Treatise of the Pleas
of the Crown (1803), vol. 1; William Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England (1769), Book IV.)

 

63               Justifiable
homicide and excusable homicide attracted different duties.  In the case of
justifiable homicide, or homicide in defending an unprovoked attack, the killer
could stand his ground and was not obliged to retreat in order to rely on the
defence of self-defence.  In the case of excusable homicide, on the other hand,
the killer must have retreated as far as possible in attempting to escape the
threat which necessitated homicide, before he could claim self-defence.  In
other words, unprovoked attacks imposed no duty to retreat.  Provoked attacks
did impose a duty to retreat.

 

64               The
two situations recognized at common law -- justifiable homicide and excusable
homicide -- were codified in the first Canadian Criminal Code in 1892,
S.C. 1892, c. 29, in ss. 45 and 46.  Section 45 when enacted in 1892 differed
from its modern equivalent, s. 34 , in that it was not divided into two
subsections.  Rather, it consisted of two parts divided by a semicolon.  The
wording too was slightly different.  Its wording indicated that the phrase at
the heart of this appeal -- ""not having provoked the assault"" -- was
applicable to both halves of the section.  Section 45 read:

 














 
  
  Self-defence against unprovoked assault
  
  
   
  
  
  45.  Every one
  unlawfully assaulted, not having provoked such assault, is justified in
  repelling force by force, if the force he uses is not meant to cause death or
  grievous bodily harm, and is no more than is necessary for the purpose of
  self-defence; and every one so assaulted is justified, though he causes death
  or grievous bodily harm, if he causes it under reasonable apprehension of
  death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was
  originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purpose, and if he
  believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself
  from death or grievous bodily harm.
  
 









 

65               The
1892 Code was clear and conformed to the common law on which it was
based.  An accused who had not provoked the assault was a person
""unlawfully assaulted"".  He was entitled to stand his ground and need
not retreat.  An accused who had provoked the assault, on the other hand, was
covered by s. 46 and could not claim to have acted in self-defence unless
he retreated.  

 

66               In
1906 the Criminal Code  underwent a general revision.  One of the
policies of the revision was to divide longer provisions into subsections.  In
accordance with this policy, s. 45 became s. 53(1) and (2).  The wording,
however, remained identical.  The marginal note to s. 53(1) read ""Self
defence.  Assault."", and the marginal note to s. 53(2) read ""Extent
justified."".  In 1927, while the section remained identical in wording and
numbering, the marginal note to s. 53(1) reverted to ""Self-defence against
unprovoked assault."".

 








67               In
1955, in the course of another general revision, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 53
became s. 34 .  The words ""Every one so assaulted is justified, though he
causes"" in the second subsection were removed, and the words ""Every
one who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes"" were substituted.  The
second subsection was further divided into two paragraphs, but all else
remained the same.  Section 35 , like the former s. 46, dealt with provoked
assault.  As might be expected, s. 34  imposed no requirement of retreat; s. 35 
did.  Thus the common law distinction between justifiable homicide and
excusable homicide was carried forward.

 

68               One
incongruity, however, emerged with the 1955 revision.  The phrase ""so
assaulted"" in the second part of the old s. 45 had clearly referred back
to the phrase in the first part ""unlawfully assaulted, not having provoked
such assault"".  In 1955, however, when ""Every one so assaulted""
was replaced in the severed subsection by ""Every one who is unlawfully
assaulted"", the clear reference back that had been present in the older versions
became less clear.  The phrase ""not having provoked such assault"",
which in the old s. 45 had modified or explained the term ""unlawfully
assaulted"" in both the first and second part of the section, was thus
effectively deleted from s. 34(2).

 

69               History
provides no explanation for why the explanatory phrase was omitted from s.
34(2).  Certainly there is no suggestion that Parliament was attempting to
change the law of self-defence.  The more likely explanation, given the history
of the changes, is inadvertence.  In the process of breaking the old s. 45 into
two subsections and later substituting new words for the old connector ""so
assaulted"", and in the context of the significant task of a general revision
of the entire Code, the need to insert the modifying phrase ""not
having provoked such assault"" in the newly worded subsection was
overlooked.

 








70               The
marginal notes accompanying ss. 34  and 35  support the view that the omission of
the phrase ""without having provoked the assault"" in the 1955 Code
was inadvertent and that Parliament continued to intend that s. 34  would apply
to unprovoked assaults and s. 35  to provoked assaults.   The note for s. 34  is
""Self-defence against unprovoked assault/Extent of justification"",
for s. 35  ""Self-defence in case of aggression"", namely assault or
provocation.  While marginal notes are not part of the legislative act of
Parliament, and hence are not conclusive support in interpretation, I agree
with the view of Wilson J. in R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541,
at pp. 556-58, that they may be of some limited use in gleaning the intention
of the enactment.  Inasmuch as they do indicate an intention, they clearly
support the interpretation suggested by the above discussion.

 

71               Parliament's
retention of the phrase ""unlawfully assaulted"" in both s. 34(1) and
s. 34(2) provides yet further confirmation of the view that Parliament did not
intend to remove the long-standing distinction between provoked and unprovoked
assault.  The meaning of that phrase, in the context of the two sections, is
indicated by its conjunction with the phrase ""not having provoked such
assault"" which modified ""unlawfully assaulted"" in the 1892
codification.  This phrase in the 1892 codification suggests that
""unlawfully assaulted"" in the context of that section meant ""not
having provoked such assault"".  There is no reason to suppose that the
meaning of the phrase ""unlawfully assaulted"" changed in the
intervening years.  If so, then on its plain wording s. 34(2) applies only to
an unprovoked assault, even in the absence of the phrase ""without having
provoked the assault"".

 

72               Parliament's
intention to retain the long-standing distinction between provoked and
unprovoked assault in the context of self-defence is also confirmed by the fact
that neither s. 34(1) nor s. 34(2) imposes a duty to retreat, indicating that
these provisions deal with the common law category of justifiable homicide,
contrasted with the excusable homicide of s. 35 .

 








73               Taking
all this into account, can it be said that Parliament intended to change the
meaning of s. 34(2) in the 1955 codification, thus abrogating sixty years of
statutory criminal law, based on hundreds of years of the common law?  I
suggest not.  To effect such a significant change, Parliament would have made
its intention clear.  This it did not do.  If the word ""unlawful"" is
given its proper meaning, it is unnecessary to read anything into the section
to conclude that it does not apply to provoked assaults.  Alternatively, if it
were necessary to read in the phrase ""without having provoked the
assault"", this would be justified.  Driedger, at p. 106, states
that a court will be justified in making minor amendments or substituting one
phrase for another where a drafting error is evidenced by the fact that the
provision leads to a result that cannot have been intended.  Redrafting a
provision, it suggests at p. 108, is acceptable where the following three
factors are present: (1) a manifest absurdity; (2) a traceable error; and (3)
an obvious correction.  All three conditions are filled in the case at bar.  In
a similar vein, Pierre-André Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in
Canada (2nd ed. 1991), suggests that words may be read in to ""express
what is already implied by the statute"" (p. 232).  This condition too is
met in the case of s. 34(2).

 

74               The
argument that Parliament intended to effect a change to the law of self-defence
in 1955 rests finally on the presumption that a change in wording is intended
to effect substantive change.  But this presumption is weak and easily rebutted
in Canada, where making formal improvements to the statute book is a minor
industry.  This is particularly the case where, as in this case, there is
evidence of a drafting error: Driedger, at pp. 450-51.

 

75               I
conclude that the intention of Parliament is clear and that s. 34(2), read
in its historical context, applies only to unprovoked assaults.








The Jurisprudence

 

76               For
many years after the 1955 amendments to the Criminal Code ,  ss. 34  and
35  were interpreted in the way that the history of the sections and the
marginal notes suggest.  In two 1975 cases, the Ontario Court of Appeal made 
broad statements to the effect that s. 34  was available only to the victims of
unprovoked assaults.  In R. v. Bolyantu (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 174, at
p. 176, the Ontario Court of Appeal (per Kelly, Lacourciere and Zuber
JJ.A.) stated:

 

The trial Judge did not instruct
the jury as to the effect of s. 35  of the Criminal Code  and in our view,
he should have so done.  Section 34  entitles one to defend himself from an
unlawful assault that he has not provoked.  Section 35  deals with the right of
a person to defend himself from an assault which he has provoked.  Section 35 
should have been left with the jury in the event that they were of the view
that Bolyantu had provoked an assault (either actual or believed) by Stimac.

 

In R. v. Squire (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 219, at p. 233, Martin
J.A. for the court distinguished between the situation where the deceased had
been provoked and hence had a ""legal right"" to strike back, and a
situation where he had not been provoked, in which case the deceased's strike
would be ""unlawful"".  In the former case, s. 35  governed, in the
latter s. 34 .

 

It is clear that a blow struck
justifiably in self-defence by the deceased cannot afford provocation, since it
is something that the deceased ""had a legal right to do"", within the
proviso to s. 215(3) of the Code.  In such circumstances the blow is not
a wrongful act.

 








The case of a person who has
willingly engaged in a fight without any necessity for defending himself falls
within the provisions of s. 35 of the Code
which establishes the conditions necessary to justify the subsequent use of
force in self-defence by one who has without justification assaulted another or
who has without justification provoked an assault upon himself.  It is
difficult to see how in such circumstances one who has actually and
willingly begun to fight could be said to be the victim of an unprovoked
assault under s. 34 . [Underlining added; italics in original.]

 

77               The
British Columbia Court of Appeal has followed the same approach.  In R. v.
Merson (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 251, at p. 255, it stated, per Nemetz
C.J.B.C. (in dissent, but not on this point):

 

Generally speaking, s. 34  provides a defence of
self-defence to a victim.  Section 35  provides such a defence to the aggressor.

 

 And per Taggart J.A., at p. 266:

 

Unlike s. 34, s. 35 is available to an accused
notwithstanding the fact that he initiates the conflict by assaulting, or by
provoking an assault by, the other combatant.

 

The Alberta Court of Appeal has taken the same view in R. v.
Alkadri (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 467, at p. 470, per Kerans J.A.:

 

If he did not provoke that assault, the killing is
justified under s. 34(2) if the jury has a doubt whether the accused caused the
death under reasonable apprehension of death and in the belief he had no
choice.  If, on the other hand, the jury views the accused as the original
aggressor, he can only invoke s. 35 and the jury must additionally ask itself
both whether he did not, before the threat to his life arose, himself try to
kill and whether he had, after he started the fight, retreated from it as far
as was feasible.

 








78               More
recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal in two cases, R. v. Stubbs (1988),
28 O.A.C. 14, and R. v. Nelson (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 449, took the view
that the court took in this case, that s. 34(2) is available to an aggressor. 
Viewed in the historical continuum, these decisions represent a departure from
the settled view at common law and throughout most of the first century of the
Canadian Criminal Code that both branches of s. 34 apply only in the
situation of justifiable assault, that is where the accused did not provoke the
fight that led to the killing.

 

Policy Considerations

 

79               The
interpretation of ss. 34 and 35 which I have suggested is supported by policy
considerations.  The Crown argues that it would be absurd to make s. 34(2)
available to aggressors when s. 35 so clearly applies.  Parliament, it argues,
could not have intended such a result.  More practically, as the Chief Justice
notes, the sections read as McIntosh urges may lead to absurd results.  If s.
34(2) is available to an initial aggressor who has killed or committed grievous
bodily harm, then that accused may be in a better position to raise
self-defence than an initial aggressor whose assault was less serious; since s.
34(2) is only available to an aggressor who ""causes death or grievous
bodily harm"", the less serious aggressor would not fall under its ambit. 
The less serious aggressor, forced to rely on s. 35, would have no defence in
the absence of retreat.  It is anomalous, to use the Chief Justice's word, that
an accused whose conduct is the more serious has the broader defence.

 

80               Common
sense suggests that ss. 34 and 35 set out two situations, each with its
corresponding defence.  The broader defence of s. 34, not requiring retreat,
goes naturally with the less serious category of conduct by the accused,
namely, the situation where the accused is unlawfully attacked, not having
provoked the assault.  The narrower defence of s. 35 similarly goes naturally
with the more serious conduct by the accused, the situation where the accused
as aggressor provoked the assault.    

 








81               While
I agree with the Chief Justice that Parliament can legislate illogically if it
so desires, I believe that the courts should not quickly make the assumption
that it intends to do so.  Absent a clear indication to the contrary, the
courts must impute a rational intent to Parliament.  As Lord Scarman put it in Stock
v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd., [1978] 1 W.L.R. 231 (H.L.), at p. 239:
""If the words used by Parliament are plain, there is no room for the
`anomalies' test, unless the consequences are so absurd that, without going
outside the statute, one can see that Parliament must have made a drafting
mistake.""   That, in my view, describes this case.  Indeed, as noted
earlier, the law goes so far as to permit a missing provision to be read in
where absurdity, traceable error and obvious correction combine. 

 

82               Not
only is the result McIntosh argues for anomalous; to my mind it is unwise and
unjust.  The common law has for centuries insisted that the person who provokes
an assault and subsequently kills the person he attacks when that person
responds to the assault must retreat if he wishes to plead self-defence. 
Otherwise, a person who wished to kill another and escape punishment might
deliberately provoke an attack so that he might respond with a death blow. 
People who provoke attacks must know that a response, even if it is
life-threatening, will not entitle them to stand their ground and kill. 
Rather, they must retreat.  The obligation to retreat from provoked assault has
stood the test of time.  It should not lightly be discarded.  Life is precious;
the justification for taking it must be defined with care and circumspection. 

 

Conclusion on Section 34(2)

 








83               In
summary, the history, the wording and the policy underlying s. 34(2) all
point to one conclusion: Parliament did not intend it to apply to provoked
assault.  It follows that the trial judge did not err in limiting s. 34(2)
in this way in his instructions to the jury.

 

2.  Should Section 37 of the Criminal Code Have Been Left with
the Jury?

 

84               Section
37 refers to two aspects of defence of the person: self-defence and defence of
others.  With respect to defence of others, the section is unique, and its
meaning is therefore clear.  I agree with the Chief Justice that the purpose of
s. 37 in the self-defence context is not readily apparent and appears to
conflict with s. 35, in so far as it applies to an initial aggressor.  However,
again the section must be viewed in keeping with the overall scheme of
self-defence established by Parliament.  Section 37 gives a broad overview of
the principles of self-defence.  Sections 34 and 35 deal with the common law of
justifiable and excusable homicide.  They thus deal with death and grievous bodily
harm.  It must therefore be assumed that ss. 34 and 35 exclusively dictate the
application of the principles laid out in s. 37 where death or grievous bodily
harm has occurred.  Where death or grievous bodily harm has not occurred, the
principles of s. 37 apply without the focus and direction provided by ss. 34 or
35.  It follows that the trial judge was correct in declining to leave it to
the jury.

 

Conclusion

 

85               I
would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 686(1) (a)(i).

 

                   The accused was
charged with possession of LSD for the purpose of trafficking and with failing
to comply with the terms of a recognizance.  In a search of the house the
accused was renting, in which he sublet two of the rooms, the police had found
a clear plastic zip‑lock bag containing blotting paper impregnated with
682 ""hits"" of LSD under a sofa in the living room where the accused
and his girlfriend had been sitting.  The only identifiable fingerprints on the
bag were those of the accused.  At the time of the search and seizure T, one of
the subtenants, was upstairs in his room, where the police found LSD blotter
paper in stereo speakers which was very similar in design to the paper
containing the LSD found under the sofa.  A five‑gram vial of hash oil
was also discovered in T's bedroom, along with ten ""hits"" of LSD in a
wallet that T was using.  The LSD was on paper of the same design as that found
in the living room.  T told the police that he was the owner of the bag
containing the drugs found under the sofa.  He also advised one of the officers
that he sold LSD in bulk lots of 25 ""hits"".  After being cautioned, T
signed an inculpatory statement reiterating that he was the owner of the
contents of the zip‑lock bag.  T was jointly charged with the accused.  T
swore an affidavit admitting liability for the drugs in order to support the
accused's application for bail.  Eight months after his arrest, however, T went
to the police station and recanted all his previous statements.  The charges
against the accused and T were severed.  T was tried first and was acquitted of
the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking.  At the accused's
trial, T testified on behalf of the Crown.  He stated that the LSD found under
the sofa belonged to the accused and indicated that the basis of this knowledge
was that he had seen the accused dealing in drugs in the past.  The explanation
T offered for lying on his previous confessions was that he was a friend of the
accused.  The accused was convicted.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority
judgment, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial at the Crown's
discretion.  This appeal is to determine (1) whether the trial judge was
entitled to infer that the accused had possession of the LSD from the presence
of his fingerprints on the plastic bag, as well as any other evidence at trial;
(2) whether T's evidence was inadmissible character evidence; and
(3) whether the trial judge's verdict was unreasonable or unsupported by
the evidence.

 

                   Held (Cory and Major JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Gonthier and Iacobucci JJ.: 
Whether or not the inference of possession can be drawn from the presence of
fingerprints is a question of fact which depends on all the circumstances of
the case and all the evidence adduced.  Having concluded correctly that the
inference could as a matter of law be drawn in this case, the trial judge went
on to draw the inference on the basis of all the evidence.  She would have been
entitled to draw an adverse inference from the accused's failure to offer an
explanation for the presence of his fingerprints once the Crown had proved a
prima facie case, although she did not draw such an inference in this case. 
Since the totality of the evidence enabled the trial judge to infer guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt, the absence of any explanation from the accused
merely failed to provide any basis to conclude otherwise.  The fact the
fingerprints were found on the bag and not on the blotter paper itself is
merely another factor to be taken into account in deciding whether or not to
draw the inference of possession based on the totality of the evidence
adduced.  The fact the accused's fingerprints were on the bag is clearly highly
probative of possession of the drugs.

 

                   The trial judge was
entitled to consider T's testimony, along with the fingerprint evidence, in
deciding whether an inference of guilt should be drawn against the accused on
the facts of the case.  While T's testimony can be construed as character
evidence relevant to show the disposition of the accused or his propensity to
traffic in narcotics, evidence which demonstrates bad character may nonetheless
be admissible if it is also relevant to an issue at trial apart from propensity
or disposition.  T's testimony is not merely relevant to the character of the
accused, but is also relevant to possession, which is a key issue in the case. 
The fact that no objection was taken to the admissibility of T's evidence at
trial or at the Court of Appeal is another indication which supports the
conclusion that the evidence was not simply character evidence, but was
admissible owing to its probative value regarding possession.  Provided its use
was so limited, its probative value overbore its prejudicial effect.

 

                   The verdict in this
case was not unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.  Taken as a whole, there
was evidence upon which the trial judge could reasonably have convicted the
accused.  The fingerprint evidence was supplemented to some extent by the
evidence as to where the bag was found as well as T's testimony.  The trial
judge was entitled to accept at least part of T's testimony notwithstanding his
inconsistent statements.

 

                   Per Cory and Major JJ.
(dissenting):  Since the accused was deprived at his trial of the presumption
of innocence and the right to remain silent, his conviction cannot stand.  The
trial judge drew an adverse inference from the fingerprint evidence in this
case, and required the accused to provide an innocent explanation for it.  This
affected the presumption of innocence because the Crown was thereby relieved of
its burden of establishing possession by the accused of the LSD contained in
the plastic bag.  The right to remain silent was infringed by the implied
requirement that the accused had to explain the presence of his fingerprints on
the plastic bag.

 

                   T's testimony
consisted of inadmissible character evidence and so could not lead to a
conclusion of guilt against the accused.  The fact that no objection was taken
to it at trial does not change the nature of the evidence, which essentially
related solely to the character and disposition of the accused, rather than to
the specific facts of the offence with which he was charged.  The Crown must
demonstrate more than a ""likelihood"" or ""opportunity""
arising from the past history of the accused.  It must demonstrate, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that this accused person was in possession of the drugs which
form the subject matter of the charge.  T's testimony could not assist the
Crown in this respect.  The prejudicial effect of such testimony would clearly
outweigh its minimal probative value with respect to the charge of possession
for the purposes of trafficking.

 

                   Once T's testimony
is excluded, the fingerprints are the only evidence against the accused.  This
evidence is not sufficient, and the trial judge erred in concluding that the
accused should have provided an explanation for the presence of the
fingerprints on the plastic bag and impliedly drawing an adverse inference from
his failure to do so.  An adverse inference may be drawn from the failure to
testify in certain circumstances, namely where the Crown has already adduced
sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case supporting a finding of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  If the accused does not adduce evidence in
such a case, he or she is at risk of conviction.  There was a foundation in law
for reasonable doubt in this case, however, given that all three tenants of the
house had access to the kitchen drawers where plastic bags similar to that
containing the LSD were kept.  It was thus possible that the accused had
innocently handled the bag in the kitchen prior to its use as a container for
the LSD.  The fingerprints on the container were not sufficient, in and of
themselves, to draw an inference of guilt requiring the accused to provide an
explanation.

I.  Facts

 

1                 The respondent was charged with
possession of LSD for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 48(2)  of the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-27 .  He was also charged with failing to
comply with the terms of a recognizance contrary to s. 145(3)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

2                 On October 3, 1991, a search
warrant was executed at the respondent's residence which he was renting.  The
respondent in turn sublet two rooms of the house to Kenneth Thelland and John
Paciocco.  All three men had the use of the living room and kitchen areas of
the house.  As a result of the search, the police discovered a clear plastic
zip-lock bag containing sheets of blotting paper impregnated with 682
""hits"" of LSD. 








 

3                 At the time of the search and
seizure Thelland was upstairs in his room and the respondent was in the living
room with his girlfriend.  The bag containing the drugs was found under a couch
in the living room where the respondent and his girlfriend had been sitting. 
The only identifiable fingerprints on the bag were those of the respondent. 
The police also found LSD blotter paper located in stereo speakers in
Thelland's bedroom which was very similar in design to the blotter paper
containing the LSD found under the couch.  A five-gram vial of hash oil was also
discovered in Thelland's bedroom, along with ten ""hits"" of LSD in a
wallet that Thelland was using.  The LSD was on paper of the same design as
that found in the living room.  In the same wallet, the police discovered a
list of names with various amounts of money opposite each name.

 

4                 Thelland told the police that he
was the owner of the bag containing the drugs which were found under the
couch.  Furthermore, while Thelland was being transported to the police
station, he advised one of the officers that he sold LSD in bulk lots of 25 ""hits"". 
After being cautioned, Thelland signed an inculpatory statement reiterating
that he was the owner of the contents of the zip-lock bag.  Thelland was
jointly charged with the respondent.

 

5                 Thelland swore an affidavit admitting
liability for the drugs in order to support the respondent's application for
bail.  However, eight months after his arrest, Thelland went to the police
station and recanted all his previous statements.  The charges against the
respondent and Thelland were severed.  Thelland was tried first before Pardu J.
of the Ontario Court (General Division), and was acquitted of the charge of
possession for the purpose of trafficking.

 

6                 At the respondent's trial, which
was also held before Pardu J., Thelland testified on behalf of the Crown.  The
explanation offered by Thelland for lying on his previous confessions was that
he was a friend of the respondent.  Thelland stated that during the police
search, while in the kitchen, he told the respondent that he would take the
blame for the offences.  However, upon later realizing how serious the charge
was, Thelland concluded that ""it wasn't worth it"".  Thus, he went to
the police and recanted his confessions.  Thelland also stated that the drugs
belonged to the respondent.  He indicated that the basis of this knowledge was
that he had seen the respondent dealing in drugs in the past.

 

7                 At trial, Thelland stated that
he had no knowledge of the LSD border paper found in his room and that the LSD
paper must have already been in the speakers when he purchased them from a
friend, whom he declined to name.  Thelland also testified that the wallet he
was using belonged to Paciocco and he had no knowledge of the list of names
found in it.  He further denied that he was the owner of the LSD found under
the sofa.  He testified that he was on welfare and could not afford to buy a
large quantity of drugs.  However, Thelland admitted that the hash oil and the
ten ""hits"" of LSD found in his room were for his personal use.

 

8                 Thelland agreed that it was
possible that the zip-lock bag found under the couch could have come from a
drawer in the kitchen to which everyone had access, although there was no
evidence whether the respondent did, in fact, handle plastic bags in the
kitchen.  Paciocco was not called by the Crown and the respondent did not
testify.

 

9                 The respondent was convicted on
both counts and was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months on the first
count and to a consecutive term of two months on the second count.  The
respondent appealed his conviction and applied for leave to appeal his
sentence.  The majority of the Court of Appeal, Finlayson J.A. dissenting,
allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial at the
discretion of the Crown: (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 43, 68 O.A.C. 58.

III.  Judgments Below

 

A.  Ontario Court (General
Division)

 

10               After reviewing the evidence,
Pardu J. noted that the credibility of Thelland was ""substantially
tarnished by his multiple falsehoods"".  She also concluded that the
blotter paper borders and the paper containing the ten ""hits"" of LSD
found in Thelland's bedroom did ""not tie Thelland to the LSD found in the
living room although some of the paper was of a similar design as there is no
indication as to the extent of distribution of this type of paper"". 
Furthermore, Pardu J. found that the alleged debt list in the wallet used by
Thelland seemed to refer to contraband cigarettes and not drugs.

 

11               In the trial judge's view, the
issue to determine was whether a court ought to infer possession by the accused
of the drugs from the presence of his fingerprints on the plastic bag.  She
referred to the case of R. v. O'Keefe (1958), 121 C.C.C. 273 (Ont.
C.A.), where Laidlaw J.A. held that ""[t]he mere fact that a person has
handled stolen goods and left his fingerprints on them is not conclusive proof
that he had possession in law of them"" (p. 279).  On the other hand, in O'Keefe,
Morden J.A. indicated that if the appellant ""had called no evidence
explaining the presence of his fingerprints, then he would have run the risk of
the Judge drawing the inference that he had had possession in law and finding
him guilty"" (p. 283).  Pardu J. then concluded as follows:

 

There
is no evidence Lepage did handle plastic bags in the drawer in the kitchen,
only that he could have had access to the drawer.  I note also that these drugs
were obvious contraband unlike a stolen article which could be handled
innocently in a multitude of ways.  Having regard to all of the evidence I am
persuaded, notwithstanding the differences in Thelland's evidence, that the
Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Lepage had possession of the
drugs, and having regard to the quantity that such possession was for the
purpose of trafficking.  A conviction on Count 2 will follow as a result.

 

B.  Ontario Court of Appeal
(1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 43

 

(1) 
Weiler J.A. (for the majority)

 

12               Weiler J.A. agreed with the
argument of the respondent that the decision in O'Keefe, supra,
where the accused's fingerprints were found on the stolen article itself,
should be distinguished from this case.  Here, the respondent's fingerprints
were found on the bag, but there was no evidence that his fingerprints were on
the actual LSD blotter paper found inside the bag.  Weiler J.A. noted that the
bag itself could have been handled in a variety of innocent ways prior to the
LSD paper being placed in it.  The trial judge failed to appreciate this
distinction.

 

13               In this regard, Weiler J.A.
referred to the case of R. v. Sweezey (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont.
C.A.), which held that the reasoning in O'Keefe did not apply where the
fingerprints were not on the stolen articles themselves, but merely on a slip
which was placed in the same package as the stolen articles.  Weiler J.A. then
held (at p. 49):

 

                   In
this case, the evidence of Lepage's fingerprints on the bag was not sufficient
to warrant the inference that he was in possession of the paper containing the
L.S.D.  In the circumstances, therefore, the trial judge erred when she drew an
inference from the fact that the accused chose not to testify:  see R. v.
Johnson (1993), [12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.), at p. 348].  It cannot be said
that, absent this error, the trial judge would have reached the same
conclusion.

 

14               Weiler J.A. allowed the appeal,
set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial at the discretion of the
Crown.  In the event of a new trial, Weiler J.A. noted that a major portion of
Thelland's evidence-in-chief appeared to be evidence of the respondent's bad
character.  After observing that there was no evidence that Thelland actually
saw the respondent place the paper containing LSD in the bag, place the bag
under the sofa or deal LSD from the bag, Weiler J.A. concluded as follows (at
p. 50):

 

                   It
is a fundamental principle of common law that the prosecution is not allowed to
prove that an accused has committed the offence with which he is charged by
evidence that he is a person of bad character and one who is in the habit of
committing crimes . . . .  Although no objection was taken to this evidence at
trial, and the appellant's counsel has not specifically raised this as a ground
of appeal, a trier of fact is entitled to accept only evidence which has been
properly admitted.  There is no indication that this evidence was proffered for
any purpose other than to indicate that Lepage was a person of bad character
and therefore likely to have committed the offence.

 

(2) 
Finlayson J.A. (dissenting)

 

15               Finlayson J.A. was of the view
that the respondent had been convicted on the basis of two sources of
evidence:  the testimony of Thelland and the respondent's fingerprints on the
exterior of the bag.  He found that the trial judge dealt properly with both of
these sources and that the Court of Appeal should not interfere with her
verdict.  With respect to the first source, Finlayson J.A. held (at p. 45):

 

It
is true that the learned trial judge did not identify what specific portions of
Thelland's evidence that she did accept.  It would appear, however, that
despite recognizing that ""the credibility of Thelland is substantially
tarnished by his multiple falsehoods"", she did believe his testimony at
least to the extent that he did not own the L.S.D., otherwise she would have
been obliged to acquit the appellant.

 

16               Finlayson J.A. disagreed with the
majority that much of Thelland's testimony was evidence of the respondent's bad
character.  He acknowledged that this evidence did cast a shadow on the
character of the respondent but he found that it was highly probative with
regard to the matters at issue in the case.  Where evidence is relevant to the
principal facts in dispute, it should be admitted with regard to possible
prejudice.  Finlayson J.A. stated (at p. 46):

 

                   Thelland
was a friend of the appellant and lived with him in the same house.  He stated
that the appellant was a drug dealer and that he owned the drugs in question. 
This evidence is highly probative to a charge that the appellant had these
drugs in his possession for the purposes of trafficking.  Any objection would
go to possible hearsay with respect to some of it and to weight with regard to
all of it.  Indeed, a vigorous cross-examination exposed these very frailties
in this portion of Thelland's testimony.  It is probably for this reason that
no objection was made at trial or on appeal to the admissibility of this
evidence.

 

Finlayson J.A. held that the trial
judge did not accept Thelland's evidence without considering its weaknesses.

 

17               Finlayson J.A. then considered the
trial judge's findings concerning the respondent's fingerprints on the bag.  He
noted that the trial judge implicitly drew an adverse inference from the
respondent's failure to testify and offer an explanation for the presence of
his fingerprints.  He dismissed the argument that these fingerprints could not
be used to support the inference that the respondent was in possession of the
bag's contents.  Finlayson J.A. then held (at pp. 46-47):

 

With
great deference to those who think otherwise, it is my opinion that the
presence of the appellant's prints on the outside of a clear package which
contains nothing but drugs is prima facie proof of his possession of the
package and its contents.  The court does not have to speculate as to how the
appellant's prints could have travelled innocently to the package alone.  I
support the reasoning of the trial judge that ""these drugs were obvious
contraband unlike a stolen article which could be handled innocently in a
multitude of ways"".

 

                   The
verdict under appeal is not unreasonable.  Additionally, the appellant did not
testify and the trial judge was entitled to draw the adverse inference that he
could not have given a sustainable explanation for the presence of these drugs
in his home and with his fingerprints on the package.  The trial judge properly
instructed herself as to the law on this issue and this court should not
interfere with the exercise of that judgment.

 

18               Finlayson J.A. stated that it was
open for the trial judge to find, on all the evidence, that the appellant was
in possession of the bag of LSD and that it was for the purpose of trafficking.

 

IV.  Issues

 

1.Did
the majority of the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the trial judge
erred in finding that the Crown had proven the respondent's possession of the
LSD from all of the evidence presented at the trial, including the evidence of
the presence of the respondent's fingerprints on the clear bag which contained
the LSD?

 

2.Was
the evidence of Thelland inadmissible character evidence?

 

3.Was
the verdict of the trial judge unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence
pursuant to s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code ?

 

 

V.  Analysis

 

19               The key issue to determine in this
case is whether the trial judge was entitled to infer that the respondent had
possession of the LSD based on the presence of his fingerprints on the plastic
zip-lock bag, as well as any other evidence at trial.  The appellant submitted
that the totality of the evidence supported the inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt and that the Court of Appeal erred in substituting its view of
the evidence for that of the trial judge.  The respondent's basic position was
that the fingerprint evidence alone could not justify an inference of guilt and
the trial judge erred in drawing an adverse inference from the respondent's
failure to testify.

 

A.  Was the trial judge entitled to
infer possession from the presence of the          fingerprints?

 

20               In order to determine whether the
trial judge erred in convicting the respondent, it is necessary to analyze
whether she was entitled to infer possession of the narcotics from the
existence of the fingerprints found on the bag or any other evidence.

 

21               In her reasons, Pardu J. placed
much emphasis on the decision of O'Keefe, supra.  In that case,
the accused was charged with breaking and entering and committing theft and the
Crown relied on the doctrine of recent possession to support its case.  The
only evidence of possession of the stolen goods was the presence of the
accused's fingerprints on the items stolen.  The accused offered the
explanation that he had innocently handled the goods at one time.  Although the
Court of Appeal was unanimously of the view that the trial judge erred in
failing to give effect to this explanation which might reasonably have been
true, there was a difference of opinion with respect to the effect of the
fingerprint evidence.

 

22               Laidlaw J.A. had this to say
regarding the fingerprint evidence, at p. 279:

 

The
mere fact that a person has handled stolen goods and left his fingerprints on
them is not conclusive proof that he had possession in law of them.  That fact
alone does not raise any presumption that they came into his possession in a
dishonest or unlawful manner.  The inference cannot be drawn from that fact
alone that he had any control whatsoever in respect of the stolen goods. 
Indeed, the mere fact of handling stolen goods and leaving fingerprints on them
is equally consistent with innocence as with any wrongful act in respect of
them.

 

                   In
my opinion, the Crown failed to establish a prima facie case against the
accused because there was no sufficient proof that any of the stolen articles
were in the possession of the accused at any time.

 

23               Although concurring in the result,
Morden J.A. concluded as follows, at pp. 282-83:

 

                   In
the case at bar at the close of the Crown's case it had been established that
the appellant's fingerprints were on the stolen articles.  This was evidence
that he had handled them, and from this it could be inferred that he had had,
perhaps for a very short space of time, physical possession of the goods.  It
is at this point that I differ, with great respect, from the persuasive
reasoning of my brother Laidlaw.  In my opinion, the Crown had made out a prima
facie case of possession in law against the appellant.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

From
the proof of the appellant's fingerprints upon the stolen articles, an
inference could have been drawn that he had had possession in law.  Whether or
not such an inference should be drawn in any particular case is a question for
the jury, and in this case for the trial Judge only, after all the evidence had
been adduced.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   The
secondary onus, that of adducing evidence, passed to the appellant.  If he had
called no evidence explaining the presence of his fingerprints, then he
would have run the risk of the Judge drawing the inference that he had had
possession in law and finding him guilty.  [Emphasis added.]

 

24               LeBel J.A. basically agreed with
the above passage and held that, in the circumstances, an explanation of the
accused was required as it was shown at least prima facie that he had possession.

 

25               In my view, whether or not the
inference of possession from the presence of fingerprints can be drawn is not
subject to a hard and fast rule.  Rather, as Morden J.A. noted, it is a
question of fact which depends on all of the circumstances of the case and all
of the evidence adduced.  In this regard, I agree with the following statement
of Fairgrieve Prov. J. from R. v. Mehrabnia (1993), 26 C.R. (4th) 98
(Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)), at p. 106:

 

                   Contrary
to Mr. Dolhai's submission concerning the effect of O'Keefe, I think
that the principle that emerges from all these cases is that whether an
accused's fingerprint on an article will support an inference that he was in
possession of the article will depend on the particular circumstances of the
case.

 

26               In the present case, after
referring to the two opposing views expressed above in O'Keefe, Pardu J.
noted that there was no evidence in this case that the respondent innocently
handled the plastic bags, only that he could have access to the kitchen drawer
where the bags were kept.  Contrary to the contention of the respondent, I do
not interpret this observation as an indication that the trial judge was
relying on the failure of the respondent to testify or to offer an explanation
as a basis upon which to draw an inference of possession.  Rather Pardu J., in
this part of her judgment, was addressing the question as to whether the
inference could, in law, be drawn.  Applying the majority view in O'Keefe,
an inference was permissible in the absence of an explanation.  While the
absence of explanation was strictly unnecessary to the determination that an
inference could be drawn in this case, Pardu J. came to the right conclusion on
this question.

 

27               Having concluded correctly that
the inference could as a matter of law be drawn, Pardu J. went on to draw the
inference, as she was entitled to do, on the basis of all the evidence
including, to some extent, the evidence of Thelland.  She concluded as follows:

 

Having
regard to all of the evidence I am persuaded, notwithstanding the differences in Thelland's
evidence, that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Lepage had
possession of the drugs, and having regard to the quantity that such possession
was for the purpose of trafficking.  A conviction on Count 2 will follow as a
result.  [Emphasis added.]

 

28               Thus, the trial judge concluded
that all of the evidence adduced entitled her to conclude beyond a reasonable
doubt that the respondent was in possession of LSD for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

29               Although I have concluded above
that Pardu J. did not draw any adverse inference from the respondent's failure
to offer an explanation for the presence of his fingerprints, I note that once
the Crown had proved a prima facie case, the trial judge would be entitled to
draw such an inference in any event.  The following passage from R. v.
Johnson (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.), at pp. 347-48, is on point:

 

No
adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer.  A weak
prosecution's case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to
testify.  But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in
R. v. Jenkins (1908), 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.),
""circumstantial evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent
network of inculpatory facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or
stand condemned"".  That point, it seems to me, can only be the point where
the prosecution's evidence, standing alone, is such that it would support a
conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Viewed that way, it would be
better said that the absence of defence evidence, including the failure of the
accused to testify, justifies the conclusion that no foundation for a
reasonable doubt could be found on the evidence.  It is not so much that the
failure to testify justifies an inference of guilt;  it is rather that it fails
to provide any basis to conclude otherwise.  When linked in that fashion to
the strength of the Crown's case, the failure to testify is no different than
the failure to call other defence evidence. . . . If the Crown's case cries out
for an explanation, an accused must be prepared to accept the adverse
consequences of his decision to remain silent:  R. v. Boss (1988), 46
C.C.C. (3d) 523, 68 C.R. (3d) 123 (C.A.), at p. 542 C.C.C., p. 42 [sic]
C.R.  But the failure to testify cannot be used as simply one of the
circumstances from which the guilt of the accused can be inferred: R. v.
Armstrong (1989), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 190 . . . As Doherty J. pointed out in R.
v. Manchev, an unreported judgment of the Ontario High Court, August 23,
1990, the accused's failure to testify is not an independent piece of evidence,
to be placed on the evidentiary scale.  It is rather a feature of the trial
which may assist in deciding what inferences should be drawn from the evidence
adduced.  [Emphasis added.]

 

I note that the Johnson
decision was cited with approval by this Court in R. v. François, [1994]
2 S.C.R. 827.

 

30               In this case, since the totality
of the evidence enabled the trial judge to infer guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt, the absence of any explanation from the respondent merely failed to
provide any basis to conclude otherwise.

 

31               It was also argued, as Weiler J.A.
found, that there is a distinction between fingerprints on a bag and
fingerprints found on the blotter paper itself, on which the LSD was
contained.  However, this distinction is merely another factor to be taken into
account in deciding whether or not to draw the inference of possession based on
the totality of the evidence adduced.  Clearly, the fact that the respondent's
fingerprints were on the bag containing the LSD is highly probative of
possession of the narcotics.  Pardu J. was entitled to consider this, along
with other evidence, in reaching her verdict.

 

32               In my opinion, the conclusion
reached by the trial judge did not constitute an error unless she relied on
inadmissible evidence in drawing the inference, or the inference of guilt was
unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code .  I will next consider each of these issues.

 

B.  The admissibility of Thelland's
evidence

 

33               In support of the trial judge's
conclusion, it appears that she relied at least in part on the testimony of
Thelland.  The following portion of Thelland's testimony is relevant for the
purpose of inferring whether the respondent was in possession of the LSD:

 

 

 

Q. 
What do you know about that LSD?

 

A. 
I know it belonged to John Paul Lepage.

 

Q. 
How do you know that?

 

A. 
He's the only one that was the major dealer in the house.

 

Q. 
When you say major dealer, what do you mean by that?

 

 

A. 
Well, quantity.

 

Q. 
Of what?

 

A. 
Of any narcotic that was coming in.

 

                   Q.  What can you
tell me about this specific bundle of drugs?

 

A.  It
belongs to John Paul Lepage.

 

Q. 
How do you know that?

 

A. 
Because I lived at the house.  I knew that he was dealing.

 

Q. 
How did you know that?

 

A. 
Well, I've seen.  Most of his friends are my friends, too, and I've seen all
kinds of it around.  So I knew basically who he was hanging around with and
stuff like that, too.

 

Q. 
Were these narcotics yours?

 

A. 
No, they were not. [Emphasis added.]

 

34               The respondent asserts that the
evidence of Thelland ought not to have been admissible as it was evidence of
bad character adduced for the purpose of showing that the respondent was the
type of person who would possess LSD.

 

35               It is true that the testimony of
Thelland can be construed as character evidence relevant to show the
disposition of the respondent or his propensity to traffic in narcotics. 
Clearly, this would be an inadmissible purpose for adducing the evidence.  However,
evidence which demonstrates bad character may nonetheless be admissible if it
is also relevant to an issue at trial, apart from propensity or disposition. 
In R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, Iacobucci J. explained the
appropriate principles, at pp. 730-31:

 

                   The
basic rule of evidence in Canada is that all relevant evidence is admissible
unless it is barred by a specific exclusionary rule.  One such exclusionary
rule is that character evidence which shows only that the accused is the
type of person likely to have committed the offence in question is
inadmissible.  As Lamer J. (as he then was) wrote for this Court in Morris
v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 201-2:

Thus
came about, as a primary rule of exclusion, the following: disposition, i.e.,
the fact that the accused is the sort of person who would be likely to have
committed the offence, although relevant, is not admissible.  As a result
evidence adduced solely for the purpose of proving disposition is itself
inadmissible, or, to put it otherwise, evidence the sole relevancy of which to
the crime committed is through proof of disposition, is inadmissible.

However,
evidence which tends to show that the accused is a person of bad character but
which is also relevant to a given issue in the case does not fall within this
exclusionary rule.  As Lamer J. went on to write at p. 202:

 

                   This
is not to say that evidence which is relevant to a given issue in a case will
of necessity be excluded merely because it also tends to prove disposition. 
Such evidence will be admitted subject to the judge weighing its probative
value to that issue (e.g. identity), also weighing its prejudicial
effect, and then determining its admissibility by measuring one to the other.

 

                   Accordingly,
evidence which tends to show bad character or a criminal disposition on the
part of the accused is admissible if (1) relevant to some other issue beyond
disposition or character, and (2) the probative value outweighs the prejudicial
effect.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

36               In the present case, the testimony
of Thelland is not merely relevant to the character of the respondent, but is
also relevant to possession which is a key issue in the case.  In the
circumstances of this case, there were three people living in the house and it
was clear that the drugs belonged to one of the three.  Surely, it is relevant
to the issue of possession to have one of the three testify that the drugs were
not his and furthermore, indicate that the respondent is in the business and
therefore it is more likely that he was the owner of the drugs.

 

37               The evidence is not being adduced
solely for the purpose of showing that the respondent is likely to have
committed the crime because he is the type of person who would be likely to
possess drugs.  As I stated above, this would be inadmissible character evidence
based on the criminal disposition or propensity of an individual.  Rather, the
evidence of Thelland merely illustrates that someone who is in the business of
dealing narcotics has more opportunity and is more likely to be in possession
of narcotics.  In this regard, the comments of Finlayson J.A., in dissent, are
apposite (at pp. 45-46):

 

                   Weiler
J.A. is of the view that much of Thelland's testimony was inadmissible, being
evidence of bad character.  She criticizes this evidence as being directed at the
[respondent's] disposition rather than his specific ownership of the drugs.  I
respectfully differ in this regard:  I accept that Thelland's evidence did cast
a shadow on the character of the accused, but it was, I think, highly probative
with regard to the matters at issue in this case.  Where evidence is very
relevant to the principal facts in dispute, it should be admitted with due
regard to its possible prejudicial effects. . . .

 

                   Thelland
was a friend of the [respondent] and lived with him in the same house.  He
stated that the [respondent] was a drug dealer and that he owned the drugs in
question.  This evidence is highly probative to a charge that the
[respondent] had these drugs in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. 
Any objection would go to possible hearsay with respect to some of it and to
weight with regard to all of it.  Indeed, a vigorous cross-examination exposed
these very frailties in this portion of Thelland's testimony.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

38               I agree with the above comments. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that no objection was taken to the
admissibility of Thelland's evidence at trial or at the Court of Appeal.  This
is another indication which supports the conclusion that the evidence was not
simply character evidence, but was admissible due to its probative value
regarding possession.  Given the manner in which the evidence was introduced, I
am not prepared to find that it was misused as evidence of disposition merely. 
Provided its use was so limited, its probative value overbore its prejudicial
effect.  Therefore, the trial judge was entitled to consider Thelland's
testimony, along with the fingerprint evidence, in deciding whether, on the
facts of the case, an inference of guilt should be drawn against the
respondent.

 

C.  Was the verdict unreasonable or
unsupported by the evidence pursuant to        s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the
Criminal Code?

 

39               It does not appear that the
majority of the Court of Appeal held that the verdict of the trial judge was
unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence since a new trial was
ordered.  If the Court of Appeal had concluded that the verdict fell within the
terms of s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code , then an acquittal
would have been the necessary result.  As well, Finlayson J.A. specifically
held that the verdict under appeal was not unreasonable.

 

40               Although the respondent was
entitled to rely on s. 686(1) (a)(i) in order to support the judgment
below, in my view, it cannot be said that the verdict was unreasonable. 
Perhaps if the Crown's case rested solely on the fingerprints found on the bag
containing the LSD one could conclude that there would be insufficient evidence
to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, in the case at bar, the
fingerprint evidence was also supplemented, to some extent, by the evidence as
to where the bag was found as well as the testimony of Thelland.  Taken as a
whole, there was evidence upon which the trial judge could reasonably have
convicted the respondent.

 

41               I should note that there is some
question concerning which portions of Thelland's testimony were accepted by the
trial judge and what weight she gave to his evidence in light of her conclusion
that Thelland's credibility ""is substantially tarnished by multiple
falsehoods"".  However, I agree with the conclusion of Finlayson J.A. (at
p. 45) that the trial judge did believe Thelland's testimony ""at least to
the extent that he did not own the L.S.D., otherwise she would have been
obliged to acquit"" the respondent.  Pardu J. does not explain why she
accepted some of Thelland's evidence in view of her comment about his tarnished
credibility.  Given the importance of Thelland's testimony in supplementing the
fingerprint evidence to support the verdict, it would have been preferable for
the trial judge to have explained more clearly which part of his evidence she
accepted and for what reasons.  Nonetheless, her failure to do so does not
amount to an error of law.  See R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p.
296.  Pardu J. was, as a matter of fact, entitled to accept at least part of
Thelland's evidence notwithstanding his inconsistent statements.  I am
satisfied that before accepting the evidence of Thelland she properly
considered its frailties and found on all the evidence that the case had been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  I cannot say that in the circumstances this
was a verdict that no jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could
reasonably have rendered.

 

VI.  Disposition

 

42               In the result, I would allow the
appeal and restore the conviction.

 

//Major J.//

 

                   The reasons of Cory
and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

43                      Major
J. (dissenting) -- It is well known that every person charged with an
offence in Canada is entitled to the benefit of the fundamental principles of
the Canadian criminal justice system, two of which are the presumption of
innocence that endures until the state has proven that person guilty of the
crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, and the right of the accused to remain
silent.

 

44               While the presumption of innocence
has endured in our criminal justice system since the country's inception, it
was clearly identified and recognized in Woolmington v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.).

 

45               The rationale for this principle
was understood long before then.  As early as the 18th century, Blackstone
asserted his oft-repeated statement that ""it is better that ten guilty
persons escape than that one innocent suffer"" (W. Blackstone, Commentaries
on the Laws of England (1897), Book IV, c. 27, at p. 358).

 

46               If our society accepts this cost
for their protection from prosecution, it follows that guilty persons will not
be convicted when the evidence fails to meet the established benchmarks.

 

47               The state faces substantial
hurdles in obtaining a conviction but, so long as we are guided by these
principles, only proof and not suspicions will suffice.

 

48               These principles remain in force
throughout the entire criminal process.  Simply stating the principles is
insufficient.  They must be fully applied in every prosecution.  They cannot be
lightened or varied, let alone disregarded.  It is my respectful conclusion
that the accused was deprived of these rights at his trial and the conviction
should not be permitted to stand.

 

49               The trial judge drew an adverse
inference from the fingerprint evidence, and required the accused to provide an
innocent explanation for it. This affected the presumption of innocence because
the Crown was thereby relieved of its burden of establishing possession by the
respondent of the LSD contained in the plastic bag. The right to remain silent
was infringed by the implied requirement that the respondent had to explain the
presence of his fingerprints on the plastic bag. 

 

50               In the case at bar, there were
only two sources of evidence which could lead to a conclusion of guilt against
the respondent: the fingerprint evidence and the testimony of Thelland. For the
reasons set out below, it is my conclusion that the evidence of Thelland
consisted of inadmissible character evidence, and the fingerprint evidence
standing alone was not sufficient to found a conviction.

 

I.                 Thelland's
Testimony

 

51               In her reasons for judgment, the
trial judge noted that Thelland's credibility was ""substantially tarnished
by his multiple falsehoods"". She did not indicate in her reasons whether
she relied on his evidence in deciding the respondent's guilt. As pointed out
by Finlayson J.A. in the court below, however, she must have believed his
testimony at least to the extent that he did not own the LSD. 

 

52               In order to establish the guilt of
the respondent, the Crown had to demonstrate that he had possession of the LSD
which was found in the living room. The plastic bag was found in a common area
of the house, used by all three residents. There was no way to determine the
age of the fingerprints, or when the bag was placed underneath the couch. Apart
from the fingerprints on the plastic bag, there was no other physical evidence
connecting Lepage to the LSD. Aside from that fingerprint evidence, the only
evidence through which the respondent's possession could have been demonstrated
was through Thelland's testimony. 

 

53               In my view, however, the testimony
of Thelland did not provide any evidence which actually connected the
respondent to the drugs whose possession he was charged with. Thelland's
evidence was in the nature of character or disposition evidence. The fact that
no objection was taken at the trial does not change the nature of that
evidence. 

 

54               Thelland testified in his examination
in chief by the Crown as follows:

 

 

 

 

Q.What
do you know about that LSD?

A.I
know it belonged to John Paul Lepage.

Q.How
do you know that? 

A.He's
the only one that was the major dealer in the house.

Q.When
you say major dealer, what do you mean by that?

A.Well,
quantity.

Q.Of
what?

A.Of
any narcotic that was coming in.

Q.What
can you tell me about this specific bundle of drugs?

A.It
belongs to John Paul Lepage.

Q.How
do you know that?

A.Because
I lived at the house. I knew that he was dealing.

Q.How
did you know that? 

A.Well,
I've seen. Most of his friends are my friends, too, and I've seen all kinds
of it around. So I knew basically who he was hanging around with and stuff like
that, too.

 

Q.Were
these narcotics yours? 

 

A.No,
they were not. [Emphasis added.]

 

The underlined portions demonstrate,
in my view, the essential nature of Thelland's testimony as relating solely to
the character and disposition of the accused, rather than to the specific facts
of the offence with which he was charged. Thelland did not testify that he had
seen Lepage handle the bag of LSD or have the bag in his possession. He did not
testify that he saw Lepage place the bag under the couch. Nor did he testify
that Lepage had admitted possessing the LSD. The only purpose of this evidence
in my view was to show the disposition of the accused, or his propensity to
traffic in narcotics and associate with dealers. This is an impermissible
purpose. 

 

55               As recognized by my colleague,
character evidence may be admissible if it is relevant to an issue in the
trial, and if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect: R. v. B.
(F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697. In Justice Sopinka's view, the evidence of
Thelland was relevant not solely to character, but also to possession, in that
someone in the business of dealing narcotics had more opportunity and was more
likely to be in possession of narcotics. With respect, this is evidence of
propensity to deal in drugs, and nothing more. This is what is precluded by the
general exclusion of character evidence. The accused is only forced to stand
trial for the transactions forming the subject matter of the charge for which
he is being tried. The Crown must therefore  demonstrate more than a
""likelihood"" or ""opportunity"" arising from the past history
of the accused. It must demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this
accused person was in possession of the drugs which form the subject matter of
the charge. The testimony of Thelland, in my view, could not assist the Crown
in this respect. The prejudicial effect of such testimony would clearly
outweigh its minimal probative value with respect to the charge of possession
for the purposes of trafficking.

 

II.                The Fingerprint
Evidence

 

56               It is not clear from the reasons
for judgment of the trial judge whether, or how, she considered Thelland's
evidence. If she did rely on it in coming to her decision, this was an error of
law. However, there remained the evidence of the fingerprints on the plastic
bag containing the LSD to consider. Once Thelland's testimony is excluded, the
fingerprints are the only evidence against the respondent. It is my opinion
that this evidence is not sufficient, and that the trial judge erred in
concluding that the respondent should have provided an explanation for the
presence of the fingerprints on the plastic bag and impliedly drawing an
adverse inference from his failure to do so.

 

57               The trial judge considered the
decision in R. v. O'Keefe (1958), 121 C.C.C. 273 (Ont. C.A.), as does my
colleague in his reasons. In that case, the accused was charged with breaking
and entering and committing theft. The only evidence of possession of the goods
by the accused was his fingerprints on the stolen goods. The Court of Appeal
was unanimous in concluding that the trial judge erred in not giving effect to
the explanation of the accused that he had innocently handled the goods, not
knowing that they were stolen. However, the majority (Morden and Lebel JJ.A.)
of the Court found that the fingerprints founded a prima facie case of
possession in law against the appellant, which could be rebutted by his
explanation. Laidlaw J.A., on the other hand, had this to say, at p. 279:

 

The
mere fact that a person has handled stolen goods and left his fingerprints on
them is not conclusive proof that he had possession in law of them. That fact
alone does not raise any presumption that they came into his possession in a
dishonest or unlawful manner. The inference cannot be drawn from that fact
alone that he had any control whatsoever in respect of the stolen goods.
Indeed, the mere fact of handling stolen goods and leaving fingerprints on them
is equally consistent with innocence as with any wrongful act in respect of
them. 

                   In
my opinion, the Crown failed to establish a prima facie case against the
accused because there was no sufficient proof that any of the stolen articles
were in the possession of the accused at any time. 

 

58               Since this decision, there have
been a number of cases dealing with the effect of fingerprint evidence. In R.
v. Bowes (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 367 (N.B.C.A.), the accused's fingerprints
were found on a stolen object, a fibreglass globe located on a post on the
property of the complainant. Ryan J.A. for the court followed the majority's
reasoning in O'Keefe and held that the trial judge ought to have found
that the accused was in possession of the object due to the presence of the
fingerprints. In Bowes, however, there was no reasonable innocent
explanation for the presence of the fingerprints on the globe, and they were
found on the stolen object itself rather than on the container. 

 

59               In Goguen v. The Queen
(1956), 116 C.C.C. 306 (N.B.C.A.), the fingerprints of the accused, charged
with break and enter, were found on the inside of a broken window. No
explanation was offered by the accused. The Court of Appeal held that the
magistrate was entitled, as a question of fact, to draw an inference of guilt
from the fingerprint evidence. In Dufresne v. The Queen (1966), 50 C.R.
208 (Que. C.A.), the accused was convicted of armed robbery largely on the
basis of the presence of a fingerprint on the rear view mirror of the stolen
car used to commit the offence. In the absence of any explanation, the jury was
entitled to infer that the accused had participated in the crime, and the
weight of the fingerprint evidence was a question for the jury. Choquette J.A.
for the court explicitly recognized that this was not a case where it was
necessary to prove possession of stolen goods. In R. v. Keller (1970), 1
C.C.C. (2d) 360 (Sask. C.A.), the fingerprints of the accused were found on a
matchbook cover recovered near a safe which had been opened by a cutting torch.
This  was held to be sufficient circumstantial evidence to found a conviction. 

 

60               In Goguen, Dufresne,
and Keller, the fingerprint evidence was used merely as circumstantial
evidence to place the accused at the scene of the crime. These cases did not
deal with the use of fingerprint evidence to prove possession of the stolen
property itself. 

 

61               In R. v. Kuhn (No. 1)
(1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 17 (Sask. C.A.), the accused's fingerprints were found
on one of two bottles containing heroin. The bottles were found in an abandoned
barn and the fingerprint was the only evidence linking the accused with the
bottles. The court found that this was not sufficient to convict the accused.
Culliton C.J.S. for the court stated, at p. 19:

 

The
fingerprint on the bottle establishes that the appellant had handled the bottle
but handling alone does not establish possession. To enter a conviction for
possession solely on the fingerprint, in the absence of any other evidence in
support thereof, in my view, is tantamount under such circumstances, to placing
a burden on the appellant to prove his innocence. This should not be done.
[Emphasis added.]

 

62               In R. v. Breau (1987), 33
C.C.C. (3d) 354 (N.B.C.A.), Ayles J.A. for the court held that evidence of the
accused's fingerprints on the outside of a car trunk and on one of eight clear
plastic bags found inside a green garbage bag containing six pounds of
marijuana was not sufficient for conviction. Ayles J.A. agreed with the
position of Laidlaw J.A. in O'Keefe that the mere fact that a person has
handled goods and left fingerprints on them is not proof of possession in law.
No inference of control could be inferred from the presence of fingerprints
alone. 

 

63               A more recent decision, R. v.
Mehrabnia (1993), 26 C.R. (4th) 98, (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)), considered
this issue in the context of a preliminary inquiry into charges of possession
of heroin for the purposes of trafficking. The only evidence against one of the
accused was a palm print on a piece of tissue paper which had been used to wrap
the bags of heroin. There was no evidence connecting the accused with the
premises where the heroin was found, nor of any relationship with the other
accused who resided at those premises.

 

64               Fairgrieve Prov. J. concluded that
this evidence was not sufficient to commit the accused for trial. After
reviewing the case law, including the decisions mentioned above, Fairgrieve
Prov. J. stated, at pp. 106-7:

 

. .
. I think that the principle that emerges from all these cases is that whether
an accused's fingerprint on an article will support an inference that he was in
possession of the article will depend on the particular circumstances of the
case. The nature of the article will clearly be of significance, such that a
fingerprint on a frying pan, as in O'Keefe, for example, would much more
readily establish possession of that item than a fingerprint on a container,
such as the bottle in Kuhn (No. 1), which might prove prior handling of
the bottle, but not necessarily knowledge and control of its contents at the
relevant time. Whether the further inference of possession would be available
would presumably depend on the presence or absence of such evidence as when the
fingerprint was placed on the bottle, whether the contents could be seen when
handling the bottle, or whether the nature of the substance in the container
was readily recognizable.

 

65               An adverse inference may be drawn
from the failure to testify in certain circumstances, namely where the Crown
has already adduced sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case
supporting a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the accused does
not adduce evidence in such a case, he or she is at risk of conviction. As
Arbour J.A. explained in R. v. Johnson (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.),
at pp. 347-48:

 

No
adverse inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer. A weak
prosecution's case cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to
testify. But there seems to come a time, where, in the words of Irving J.A. in R.
v. Jenkins (1908) 14 C.C.C. 221 at p. 230, 14 B.C.R. 61 (C.A.), ""circumstantial
evidence having enveloped a man in a strong and cogent network of inculpatory
facts, that man is bound to make some explanation or stand condemned"". That
point, it seems to me, can only be the point where the prosecution's evidence,
standing alone, is such that it would support a conclusion of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. Viewed that way, it would be better said that the absence of
defence evidence, including the failure of the accused to testify, justifies
the conclusion that no foundation for a reasonable doubt could be found on the
evidence. It is not so much that the failure to testify justifies an
inference of guilt; it is rather that it fails to provide any basis to conclude
otherwise.  [Emphasis added.]

 

66               In my view, there was a foundation
in law for reasonable doubt in this case given that all three tenants of the
house had access to the kitchen drawers where plastic bags similar to that
containing the LSD were kept. It was thus possible that the respondent had
innocently handled the bag in the kitchen prior to its use as a container for
the LSD. The fingerprints on the container were not sufficient, in and of
themselves, to draw an inference of guilt requiring the accused to provide an
explanation. 

 

67               I agree with my colleague that the
question of whether an inference should be drawn from the presence of
fingerprints is not subject to a hard and fast rule. In the circumstances of
the case at bar, however, I would conclude that the inference should not be
drawn. The fingerprints were on the container, rather than on the prohibited
substance. That container could have been handled by the respondent in an
innocent manner. There was no other evidence, aside from the inadmissible character
evidence of Thelland, which would link the respondent to the possession of the
LSD found under the couch, in a common area of a house shared by two other
individuals. This was not a case where the presence of fingerprints on the
container was sufficient to meet the burden resting on the Crown.

     S was charged with break, enter, and theft.  M was separately charged with the same offence.  The charges against the two young offenders were laid separately because of an administrative procedure applicable at the youth court.  The Crown subpoenaed M as its main witness at S's trial but, following an application by M's counsel, the trial judge quashed the subpoena on the ground that to compel M's testimony would violate s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The trial judge found that, in the circumstances, M had an absolute right to silence which made him non-compellable.  The Crown proceeded with the trial against S and called the owner of the stolen property and the investigating officer who had received the property from S and placed it in the charge of the property officer.  The Crown did not call the property officer and, at the close of the Crown's case, defence counsel argued that failure to call the property officer constituted a break in the continuity of the evidence.  In response, the Crown asked the trial judge to dismiss the charges against S on the basis that the charges had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge dismissed the charges and, subsequently, the charges against M were stayed.  The Crown appealed the acquittal on the ground that the trial judge erred in quashing M's subpoena.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.
     Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.
     Per La Forest, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  There is in Canada a principle against self-incrimination which is part of fundamental justice.  The policy justification for the principle, at common law and in the Charter , rests upon the idea that the Crown must establish a ""case to meet"".  The principle, however, is not absolute and may reflect different rules in different contexts.  It also has the capacity to introduce new rules to benefit the overall system.
     On the facts of this case, M was properly compellable at S's trial and the trial judge erred in quashing the subpoena.  While a statutory compulsion to testify engages the liberty interest of s. 7 , M's liberty interest is affected in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  Fundamental justice is satisfied because neither M's testimony, nor a limited class of evidence derived from his testimony, can later be used to incriminate him in other  


page 453

proceedings (save for proceedings in respect of perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence).
     The similarity between the structure of ss. 11 (c) and 13  of the Charter , and the statutory approach apparent in s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , demonstrate an obvious attempt to enact in constitutional form the same structural protection against self-incrimination for witnesses which existed historically.  The protection envisioned involves a general rule of witness compellability, coupled with an evidentiary immunity.  Although care must be taken to guard against defining the principles of fundamental justice in overreliance upon a legislative position, even a position of long standing, to contend that s. 7 of the Charter demands a testimonial privilege for all witnesses is to suggest that the framers of our Constitution misunderstood the nature of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  and forgot to include a provision in the Charter  comparable to the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution.  Such a proposition is unacceptable.
     Further, for s. 7  purposes, there is no need for an exemption to the general compellability rule which is based upon the status of the person whose evidence is sought to be compelled.  The possibility that a proceeding not instituted for the purpose of obtaining self-conscriptive evidence will nonetheless have that effect is a problem which confronts every witness who is compellable and who must answer questions pursuant to s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .  The Charter  protections against self-incrimination should not vary with individual status.  The Charter 's structure, however, cannot be invoked to condone all types of inquisition and one must focus on the purpose, or character, of proceedings at which testimony is sought to be compelled as a way to confine the reach of a general compellability rule.  An objection must be lodged against proceedings which are justified by a self-incriminatory purpose.  Here, although S's trial might be considered an inquiry in relation to M as witness, the inquiry is of the sort permitted by our law.  The search for truth in a criminal trial against a named accused has an obvious social utility, and the truth-seeking goal operates to limit effectively the scope of the proceedings in terms of the ""inquiry effect"".  The  


page 454

laws of relevancy would preclude the random examination of individuals within a criminal trial.
     While in Hebert the recognition of a residual role for s. 7  gave effect to the Charter  as a coherent system, to use s. 7  as the repository for an absolute right to silence or for the common law witness privilege would do violence to that system since it would become difficult to account for the existence of s. 13  of the Charter .
     Section 13 , however, does not exclusively define the scope of the available evidentiary immunity.  The principle against self-incrimination also finds recognition under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  and a review of the principles developed under that section discloses a need for a partial derivative use immunity under s. 7  of the Charter .  Derivative evidence which could not have been obtained, or the significance of which could not have been appreciated, but for the testimony of a witness ought generally to be excluded under s. 7  in the interests of trial fairness.  Such evidence, although not created by the accused and thus not self-incriminatory by definition, is self-incriminatory nonetheless because the evidence could not otherwise have become part of the Crown's case.  To this extent, the witness must be protected against assisting the Crown in creating a case to meet.
     The test for exclusion of derivative evidence involves the question whether the evidence could have been obtained but for the witness's testimony and requires an inquiry into logical probabilities, not mere possibilities.  The important consideration is whether the evidence, practically speaking, could have been located.  Logic must be applied to the facts of each case, not to the mere fact of independent existence.  There should be no automatic rule of exclusion in respect of any derivative evidence.  Its exclusion ought to be governed by the trial judge's discretion.  The exercise of the trial judge's discretion will depend upon the probative effect of the evidence balanced against the prejudice caused to the accused by its admission.  The burden is on the accused to demonstrate that the proposed evidence is derivative evidence deserving of a limited immunity protection.
     In the context of S's criminal trial, M's testimony is therefore compellable under the general rule applicable to all witnesses, and the principle against self-incrimination is satisfied if M receives the simple use immunity provided by s. 13  of the Charter , together with a residual derivative use immunity in respect of evidence which could not have been obtained but for his  


page 455

compelled testimony.  This residual immunity will be given recognition by the trial judge through the exercise of a discretion, but exclusion will be the likely result because the self-incrimination principle demands the preservation of trial fairness.
     Section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  does not infringe s. 7  of the Charter .  Section 5(1) of the Act abolishes the common law privilege against self-incrimination, with the result that a compellable witness must answer questions posed, and s. 5(2)  offers such a witness protection in the form of an immunity.  Neither subsection purports to make evidence of any kind necessarily admissible at a subsequent proceeding.  Thus, nothing in s. 5  offends the requirement for a partial derivative use immunity under s. 7 .
     This Court had jurisdiction to consider this appeal since S could properly raise a question of law based upon M's compellability as a witness.  The question associated with M's rights and privileges was initially raised by the Crown in the Court of Appeal, and it would ill comport with our system of law to suppose that S had no right to respond.  An appeal to this Court is simply an extension of S's response.
     The Court of Appeal did not err in ordering a new trial pursuant to s. 686(4) (b)(i) of the Criminal Code .  The Crown did not concede the continuity problem and only made a general concession to the effect that its case did not meet the criminal standard of proof.  Irrespective of the Crown's effort to link S to the offence by focusing on his alleged possession of certain property, the Crown had also planned to link him to the offence by offering M's eyewitness evidence.  The Court of Appeal was correct to order a new trial in these circumstances, since it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if M had testified.
     Per Lamer C.J.:  Iacobucci J.'s comments concerning the status of the principle against self-incrimination as a principle of fundamental justice were agreed with and his conclusions regarding the availability of derivative evidence immunity as a means of realizing this principle were generally agreed with.  In certain circumstances, however, s. 7  of the Charter  will provide additional protection beyond evidentiary immunity in order to  


page 456

safeguard adequately the right of individuals not to be compelled to incriminate themselves and will mandate exceptions to the general rule that the state is entitled to every person's evidence.  The right of an accused not to be forced into assisting in his own prosecution is perhaps the most important principle in criminal law and the principles of fundamental justice require that courts retain the discretion to exempt witnesses from being compelled to testify, in appropriate circumstances.  The person claiming the exemption has the burden of satisfying the judge that in all the circumstances the prejudice to his interests overbears the necessity of obtaining the evidence.  The factors suggested by Sopinka J. will ordinarily need to be considered by the judge exercising this discretion.  Here, the trial judge erred in quashing the subpoena against M on the basis of an absolute right to silence.
     Iacobucci J.'s conclusions  on the other issues arising in this case were agreed with.
     Per Sopinka and McLachlin JJ.:  The question in this case is whether, under the principles of fundamental justice, a co-accused can be compelled as a witness.  This question can be resolved in each case by balancing the principle that the state is entitled to every person's evidence and the principle that an accused is entitled to remain silent.  This, generally, is the approach which accords with the common law and therefore, if carried into s. 7  of the Charter , is the relevant principle of fundamental justice.  If not included in s. 7 , it remains a principle of the common law.
     It would be consistent with the development of the common law and the principles of fundamental justice to allow the court to make an exception to the general right of the state to every person's evidence when the right of the accused to remain silent is seen to outweigh the necessity of having that evidence.  This exception would recognize the anomaly of the systematic compulsion of persons accused of crime to testify in other proceedings while, at the same time, they are entitled to remain silent if interrogated by the police before their trial and are granted absolute immunity from testifying during their trial.  The absence of such an exception would undermine these rights if not rendering them illusory.  This approach accepts the basic tenets of the applicable common law principles but with a flexible, principled approach to the exceptions to a common law rule.   


page 457

Further, this approach does not affect the operation of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , which deals with the right of a witness who is already on the stand.  It is also more conducive to the efficient conduct of trials.
     In some cases, the unfairness of compelling a witness to testify will not appear until after that witness has given evidence. In such circumstances, the person so compelled should not be precluded from seeking a remedy at the trial stage in proceedings against that person.
     A person charged may thus have a right to an exception from the principle that the state is entitled to every person's evidence.  The person claiming the exception must assert the right before his testimony is taken and has the burden of satisfying the judge that in all the circumstances the prejudice to his interests overbears the necessity of obtaining the evidence.  A person who is for all intents and purposes an accused but has not been formally charged may in some circumstances also claim the exception.  In balancing the accused's interest in remaining silent against the Crown's interest in obtaining evidence, the following non-exhaustive factors should be considered in arriving at a decision with respect to compellability:  (1) the relative importance of the evidence to the prosecution in respect of which the accused is compelled; (2) whether the evidence can be obtained in some other manner; (3) whether the trial or other disposition of the charge against the accused whose evidence is sought to be compelled could reasonably be held before he is called to testify; (4) the relationship between the proposed questions to the accused witness and the issues in his trial; (5) whether the evidence of the accused witness is likely to disclose defences or other matters which will assist the Crown notwithstanding the application of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act ; and (6) any other prejudice to the accused witness, including the effect of publication of his evidence.  Failure to raise the issue of compellability at the appropriate time, or an adverse ruling in that regard, will in some circumstances not preclude the matter being renewed in subsequent proceedings. Here, the trial judge erred in quashing the subpoena against M on the basis of the application of an absolute right to remain silent which made him non-compellable.  Since  


page 458

the charge against M has been stayed, however, the issue of his compellability will not arise at S's new trial.
     Per L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ.:  Common law protections against self-incrimination focus specifically on situations in which the state seeks to rely on compelled communications -- words or actions that may be communicative in character -- as a means of proving the accused's guilt.  The principle is not so broad as to contemplate all self-incriminatory effects.  Such a broad vision of the principle against self-incrimination would be inconsistent with many state actions, such as compulsion to submit to a breath sample, fingerprinting, participation in identification line-ups, or compulsion to produce documents, all of which implicate the individual in his own prosecution.  There is also no rule at common law that prohibits use by the state of derivative evidence per se.  The derivative use immunity approach is an American invention required to deal with the unique language of their Fifth Amendment.  Many of the concerns at common law said to be countenanced by the principle against self-incrimination actually relate even more fundamentally to general considerations of fairness, human decency and the integrity of the judicial system.  The doctrine of abuse of process has developed as a means to address these concerns directly.  The occasional exception to compellability has been recognized to address these concerns indirectly.  If exceptions are to be made to the general rule of compellability, then they should develop along the lines of these underlying principles of fairness rather than out of an imprecise extension of the common law principle against self-incrimination.
     In the Charter , ss. 10 (b), 11 (c) and 11 (d) are evidence that there exists a residual principle against self-incrimination under s. 7 .  This protection manifests itself in the form of the ""right to silence"".  A careful examination of ss. 13 , 24  and 7  of the Charter , however, reveals that the Charter  has not created a broader fundamental principle against self-incrimination than that which existed previously at common law.

The historical context in which s. 13  of the Charter  was introduced suggests strongly that Parliament did not intend to enhance significantly the protections against self-incrimination available under s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . Had the Charter 's drafters intended to depart from the Canadian status quo towards the  


page 459

American model involving derivative use immunity, there would have been material changes in the wording or breadth of s. 13  as compared to s. 5(2) .  The drafters would not have left such an important change to the indefinite realm of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter .
     The Charter  did not, under s. 7 , actually create any brand new principles of fundamental justice.  The Charter  embodies those principles which Canadians consider fundamental to our system of justice and the principle against self-incrimination has not been radically redefined by the advent of the Charter . Defining ""self-incrimination"" over-inclusively as arising whenever the state obtains evidence which it could not have obtained ""but for"" the individual's participation would take the notion of self-incrimination far beyond the communicative character that grounds it at common law.  If a principle against self-incrimination under s. 7  of the Charter  were to be based on the ""but for"" test, the admission of evidence obtained through breathalyzers, fingerprinting, searches, or compelled production of documents would be inconsistent with s. 7 .  Objections made to the constitutionality of such evidence, however, are only recognized under the Charter  in so far as they address the manner in which that evidence was obtained.  Objections to the fact that such evidence may be gathered, and to the fact that the individual was compelled to assist in its production, are not recognized under the Charter .  Both the common law and the Charter  draw a fundamental distinction between incriminating evidence and self-incriminating evidence:  the former is evidence which tends to establish the accused's guilt, while the latter is evidence which tends to establish the accused's guilt by his own admission, or based upon his own communication.  The s. 7  principle against self-incrimination that is fundamental to justice requires protection against the use of compelled evidence which tends to establish the accused's guilt on the basis of the latter grounds, but not the former.  Since evidence may not be admitted at trial on the basis of any compelled act which is communicative in character, the substantive fairness of the trial is not prejudiced by the fact of prior compelled testimony.  Any remaining concerns about fairness must therefore relate to the manner by which the derivative evidence was obtained, and are therefore procedural.  Such concerns centre on the integrity of our justice system and on fairness to, and the dignity of, the individual.  These concerns are addressed by resort to the notions of fundamental fairness which underlie almost all of the values and principles said to flow from our Charter , and not  


page 460

merely by a broad expansion of the principle against self-incrimination.
     Furthermore, like other provisions of the Charter , s. 7  must be approached purposively.  A commitment to purposive interpretation entails a commitment to ensuring that a legal principle is interpreted sufficiently broadly to further the interests it is meant to protect, yet not so broadly as to overshoot them.   Ultimately, the principles of fundamental justice require a balancing of societal interests with those of the accused.  To strike a balance that would effectively prohibit the state from engaging in otherwise lawful activity, in furtherance of a pressing and substantial state objective, which nonetheless has the effect of conscripting an individual to assist in his own investigation, would stultify law enforcement in our country.  Accordingly, the common thread that is truly fundamental to our system of justice cannot be so broad as to extend to all potentially self-incriminatory effects of state action.  What is fundamental to justice is that the state not be able to invade the sanctum of the mind for the purpose of incriminating that individual.  This fundamental tenet is preserved, in its entirety, by a principle against self-incrimination that is communicative in character.  This principle, in turn, is largely embodied in s. 13  of the Charter .  To the extent that state compulsion may elicit incriminating communications or communicative behaviour from an individual even though not in the context of formal proceedings, this fundamental protection is rounded out by the recognition of a residual right to silence in s. 7 .  The right to silence in s. 7  is triggered when an adversarial relationship arises between the individual and the state.  Given the protections that already enure to a witness under s. 13  of the Charter  and s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , an individual who is compelled as a witness at other proceedings only truly stands in an adversarial position vis-à-vis the state when the state is seeking predominantly to build its case against that witness.  This adversarial position can exist even in circumstances where the witness has not yet been charged.  As long as the state is pursuing a valid purpose and not seeking predominantly to obtain discovery against the witness, however, the right to silence is not engaged, nor has an adversarial relationship between the compelled witness and the state crystallized.


page 461


     Section 24(2)  of the Charter  is a remedy for a breach of a Charter  right.  It is neither a substantive right itself nor a principle of fundamental justice.  The s. 24(2)  jurisprudence elaborates mainly upon what is meant by the phrase ""bringing the administration of justice into disrepute"" and should not be overly relied upon in order to define a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 .  Section 24(2)  is not coextensive with s. 7 .  If the principles of fundamental justice are the bedrock of our legal system, then they must rest on more solid foundations than this Court's most recent jurisprudence governing s. 24(2) .
     A witness may be entitled to claim an exception under s. 7  from the principle that the state is entitled to every person's evidence if it is established that the Crown is engaging in fundamentally unfair conduct.  Attempts to by-pass the procedural safeguards that are intrinsic to the notions of dignity and individual liberty contained in the Charter  and to our conception of fundamental trial fairness are fundamentally unfair conduct that violates the principles of fundamental justice.  Fundamentally unfair conduct thus will most frequently occur when the Crown is seeking, as its predominant purpose (rather than incidentally), to build or advance its case against that witness instead of acting in furtherance of those pressing and substantial purposes validly within the jurisdiction of the body compelling the testimony.  A witness may not be compelled in a proceeding which is, in essence, an investigation of that witness, rather than a prosecution of an accused.  When the state legitimately compels an individual to testify in order to pursue a valid purpose, unfavourable effects flowing from the disclosure of information that may incriminate or otherwise prejudice that person would not per se contravene the principles of fundamental justice embodied in s. 7 , given other existing protections under the Charter .  As well, the subsequent acquisition of evidence which may be derivative would not, per se, violate the Charter , where that evidence is acquired in a manner that is incidental to the valid purposes for which the witness was compelled.  The onus is on the witness to establish fundamentally unfair conduct contrary to s. 7 .  In determining whether such conduct exists, the status of that witness as a person who has already been charged is not conclusive, but is an important factor in determining whether fundamentally unfair conduct has been established.  While findings of fundamentally unfair conduct should not be limited to persons charged, as a practical  


page 462

matter it will be difficult to establish such conduct without such status.
     The issue of fundamentally unfair conduct amounting to a breach of the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7  may be raised when the witness is subpoenaed and when the witness is tried.  At the subpoena stage, the state shall disclose to the tribunal the general purpose for which it seeks to compel that individual's testimony and the relative importance of that evidence to the prosecution in respect of which the witness is compelled.  The witness may then attempt to demonstrate fundamentally unfair conduct from the fact of the compulsion.  If the witness succeeds, the appropriate  remedy will be a quashing of the subpoena.  If not, the issue may again be raised at the trial stage.  At that stage, the court will ask itself whether, if what is now known had been known at the time the state sought to compel the witness, an exception would have been made to the general rule of compellability and the subpoena would have been quashed.  Through fundamentally unfair conduct, the state may have gained important and diverse strategic advantages.  If fundamentally unfair conduct contrary to s. 7  is demonstrated at that stage, the appropriate remedy is generally a stay of proceedings.
     In light of the finding as to Crown conduct that would violate s. 7 , the protections accorded a witness under ss. 7  and 13  of the Charter  are such that although s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  abrogates the common law privilege against self-incrimination, this fact does not render s. 5  unconstitutional.  Section 5  therefore does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .
     In the present case, the compulsion to testify subject to possible imprisonment for failure to comply was, itself, a deprivation of liberty which brings the issue of the witness's compellability within the scope of a s. 7  examination. The trial judge, however, erred in quashing the subpoena against M since he arrived at this conclusion on the basis that, under the circumstances, M should enjoy an absolute right to remain silent.  The charge against M has been stayed and any question as to his compellability is now moot.

While I agree with Iacobucci J.'s remarks concerning the status of the principle against self-incrimination as a principle of fundamental justice (remarks that are in accordance with the views I expressed in R. v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, and R. v. Jones, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229), and while I generally agree with his conclusions regarding the availability of derivative-evidence immunity as a means of realizing this principle, I believe it is necessary to say more about the question of whether, in certain circumstances, s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  requires additional measures to be taken to safeguard the right of individuals not to be compelled to incriminate themselves.


page 469


     Although I agree with Iacobucci J.'s conclusion that the mere fact that a person is charged with a crime or is a serious suspect does not automatically entitle him or her to avoid being compelled to testify, this does not answer the question of whether s. 7  might sometimes mandate exceptions to the general rule that the state is entitled to every person's evidence.  In my view, in certain circumstances such an exemption is justified and, indeed, is constitutionally required.
     As I observed in P. (M.B.), supra, at p. 577, ""[p]erhaps the single most important organizing principle in criminal law is the right of an accused not to be forced into assisting in his or her own prosecution"" -- the ""case to meet"" principle.  This principle, I noted, ""is perhaps best described in terms of the overarching principle against self-incrimination, which is firmly rooted in the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms "" (p. 577).  The use immunity provided by s. 13  of the Charter , together with the s. 7  based derivative-use immunity proposed by my colleague Iacobucci J., will protect witnesses against the possibility of their testimony being used directly as evidence against them, or being used indirectly as a means of gathering derivative incriminatory evidence.  In many cases, these forms of immunity will provide adequate protection for the principle against self-incrimination.  In some situations, however, forcing a witness to testify will violate the case-to-meet principle in a manner that cannot be remedied by an exclusionary rule.  For example, the compelled testimony might reveal an accused's defence strategy, or bring to light crimes of which the state was previously unaware.  In these latter cases, attempting to protect the principle against self-incrimination through use immunity and derivative-use immunity would indeed be, as my colleague Sopinka J. notes (at p. 625), ""like closing the barn door after  


page 470

the horses have escaped"".  As Iacobucci J. observes (at p. 535):
     [I]f it be accepted that a person can always be compelled as a witness and that protection by way of evidentiary immunity will always be sufficient, then it must also be accepted that we have gone considerable distance toward diluting the principle of the case to meet without ever having said so.  [Emphasis in original.]
     In my view, the principles of fundamental justice require that, in addition to the exclusionary rule proposed by Iacobucci J., courts retain the discretion to exempt witnesses from being compelled to testify, in appropriate circumstances.  I agree with my colleague Sopinka J. that the person claiming the exemption ""has the burden of satisfying the judge that in all the circumstances the prejudice to his or her interests overbears the necessity of obtaining the evidence"" (p. 630).  I also share his view that the factors listed on pp. 630-31 will ordinarily need to be considered and weighed by the judge exercising this discretion.  Of course, it follows from my general agreement with the position adopted by Iacobucci J. that I am of the view that witnesses who fail to satisfy the court that they should be excused from testifying will still receive the protection of the use immunity rules and derivative-use immunity rules he sets out in his reasons.
     The assertion that the courts have the discretion to make exceptions to the general rule of compellability in situations where it would be unfair to force a person to testify is not, I would suggest, a novel proposition in Canadian law, even as it stood before the Charter .  As Sopinka J. observes at p. 621, this Court's decision in Batary v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan, [1965] S.C.R. 465, can be seen as having been informed by this view.  My colleague notes that in Batary ""the Supreme Court, speaking through Cartwright J. (no stranger to the principles of fundamental justice), considered that the circumstances in which the accused was called were unfair and therefore an exception could be made to the general principle of compellability"".  I agree with this interpretation of Batary, and with  


page 471

Sopinka J.'s observation that Batary was expressly confirmed by a majority of this Court in O'Hara v. British Columbia, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 591, at p. 607.  Even if, strictly speaking, the remarks of the majority in that case are obiter dicta, the statement in O'Hara represents the well-considered opinion of the Court and constitutes the applicable law on this point.
     As an example of a situation where a judicial exemption from compellability would, in my view, be warranted, the following hypothetical case can be considered.   Suppose that the members of a trade association in a particular industry met and agreed upon a scheme to fix the prices of the goods they produced, an indictable offence under s. 45(1) (c) of the Competition Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34 .  Suppose further that the Director of Investigation and Research obtained documents clearly indicating the persons involved and the nature of their involvement -- for example, an agreement to fix prices signed by the parties.  If the Director commenced an inquiry and obtained subpoenas compelling the signatories to testify, it would, in my view, be open to the signatories to apply to the court for an exemption from compulsion to testify.  In such a case, where the facts revealed that the Director had already concluded that an offence had been committed and had identified the parties to the offence, the court would be justified in concluding that forcing the suspects to testify would violate their s. 7  rights.  In these circumstances, I believe the court would have the discretion to declare the subpoenas to be of no force and effect, thereby excusing the suspects from testifying.
     In his reasons, Iacobucci J. recognizes the need for additional protection of the principle against slf-incrimination beyond evidentiary immunity in certain cases.  As he notes (at p. 536):

[T]he Charter 's structure ... is founded upon the Crown's obligation to make a case, but it also assumes a general rule of compellability coupled with evidentiary  


page 472

immunity.  If, however, the Charter  places no limits on when this structure can be invoked, then the Charter  could, in fact, condone an inquisition of the most notorious kind.  Such condonation would bespeak an impossible dualism.  To ask a question by paraphrasing a concern voiced in Thomson Newspapers [Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425], at p. 606 (per Sopinka J.): are we prepared to arm the police with subpoena powers?
     In my view, the answer to this question must be ""no"".  Although I have the greatest respect for the view of my colleague Iacobucci J. that the fashioning of an acceptable response should be left to another day, I believe that it is incumbent upon this Court to provide guidance to the lower courts, which have been confronted with this problem in the past, and which will continue to face similar problems in the future.  In my view, the judicial discretion recognized by Sopinka J. serves as an appropriate means of responding to Iacobucci J.'s concerns, which I share.
     On the facts of this case, I agree with Sopinka J. that the trial judge erred in quashing the subpoena against J.P.M. on the basis of an absolute right to silence which made J.P.M. non-compellable.  I further agree with the conclusions reached by Iacobucci J. on the other issues arising in this case, and would answer the constitutional questions as he proposes.
     The judgment of La Forest, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by
     IACOBUCCI J. -- This appeal principally asks a narrow question:  is a person separately charged with an offence compellable as a witness in the criminal trial of another person charged with that same offence?  To seek an answer to this narrow question, however, is to embark on a much broader inquiry.  We are asked to contemplate fundamental issues like the principle against selfincrimination, the right to silence, the protection offered by the testimonial privileges, and the prospect of  


page 473

evidentiary immunity.  Where do these concepts fit in our criminal justice system, and how are they to be treated by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     I.  Facts
     The appellant, R.J.S., was charged with the indictable offence of break, enter, and theft, contrary to s. 348(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  J.P.M. was separately charged with the same offence.  The Scarborough youth court had exclusive jurisdiction in respect of these alleged offences, inasmuch as the alleged offenders were both ""young persons"" as defined by the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1 , ss. 2(1)  and 5(1) .  Charges against the two were separately laid because of an administrative procedure applicable at that court which directs that younger accused be tried in Phase One youth court, and the older accused in Phase Two.
     J.P.M. was to be the Crown's main witness at the trial of R.J.S.  However, after R.J.S. was arraigned but before he entered a plea, counsel for J.P.M. brought a motion to quash the subpoena which had been issued to compel J.P.M.'s testimony.  The trial judge allowed the motion and quashed the subpoena.
     The Crown proceeded with the trial against R.J.S. and called two witnesses:  Isaac Chung, the owner of the business where the offence allegedly occurred, and Detective Constable Carter.  Chung testified about the property which disappeared from his store and which the police later returned to him.  Carter testified that R.J.S., whom he knew to be wanted in relation to an offence, arrived at the police station one day and turned over certain property to him.  Carter said that he tagged the items he received from R.J.S. and placed them in the control of a property officer who did not testify at trial.
     The defence called no evidence.  After the Crown closed its case, defence counsel argued that  


page 474

the Crown could not prove continuity in respect of the tagged property.  In response, Crown counsel stated that ""there is not enough evidence here to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a break and enter has been committed and I'd ask Your Honour to dismiss the charges on that basis"".
     The trial judge dismissed the charges against R.J.S.   The Crown appealed, and the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the subpoena issued against J.P.M. should not have been quashed:  (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 774, 61 O.A.C. 395, 80 C.C.C. (3d) 397, 21 C.R. (4th) 47, 14 C.R.R. (2d) 244.  A new trial was ordered.  R.J.S. appeals as of right to this Court pursuant to s. 27(1)  of the Young Offenders Act and s. 691(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  on a question of law alone.  On this point, the Court in R. v. C. (T.L.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 1012, subsequently held that such appeals as of right were not available under the Young Offenders Act.  In the circumstances, the Court has granted leave nunc pro tunc.
     II.  Relevant Constitutional and Statutory Provisions

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
     7.  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
     11.  Any person charged with an offence has the right
     . . .
     (c)  not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence;
     (d)  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;
     13.  A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given

used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence.
     Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 
     5.  (1)  No witness shall be excused from answering any question on the ground that the answer to the question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.
     (2)  Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer on the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering the question, then although the witness is by reason of this Act or the provincial Act compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or admissible in evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of that evidence.

     III.  Judgments
     Ontario Court, Provincial Division
     Bovard Prov. Div. J. accepted the argument made by counsel for J.P.M., namely, that the subpoena issued against J.P.M. infringed his Charter  right to remain silent.  In an oral decision, Bovard Prov. Div. J. stated that ""[i]t's  clear in our law that the accused is not obliged to disclose any kind of information or defenses to the Crown beforehand"".  He thoroughly reviewed Re Praisoody (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 606  (Gen. Div.), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (sub nom. R. v. Devasagayam), and cases cited therein, and concluded that he was both bound and  


page 476

persuaded by the logic of that decision.  Bovard Prov. Div. J. held that to compel J.P.M.'s testimony would be to violate s. 7  of the Charter .  He quashed the subpoena and later acquitted R.J.S. after Crown counsel conceded that its case could not meet the criminal standard of proof.
     Ontario Court of Appeal (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 774
     J.P.M. did not participate before the Court of Appeal because the charge against him was stayed after R.J.S.'s acquittal.  Carthy J.A. for the court noted, and counsel were agreed, that the change in J.P.M.'s  status could not affect the issues on appeal.  Carthy J.A. also noted that, although proper notices were not given to the Attorneys General, s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act  was at issue before him since the trial judge's decision failed to give effect to the language of that provision.  In light of his Charter  conclusions, however, Carthy J.A. did not regard the failure to give notice as important.
     Carthy J.A. first reviewed the decisions of this Court in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, and R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.  He stated that s. 7  of the Charter  recognizes residual rights not recognized in either s. 11  or s. 13 , but he said that such rights are not ""absolute"" and that ""a balancing of interests is required"" to determine their extent.  In this regard, he contrasted the criminal trial setting to the investigatory setting.
     Carthy J.A. noted that ""[t]he right of an accused to remain silent at his or her trial has long existed side by side with the compellability of a witness who has been charged with the same offence but who will be tried separately"" (p. 779).  He indicated  


page 477

that such compellability is the foundation for an accused person's ability to apply for a separate trial, which ability in part protects the accused's right to make full answer and defence, but which ability also ensures that justice will be done.  Carthy J.A. reasoned that ""attaining a true result on all the available evidence overshadows the marginal area of exposure of the witness that is not protected by s. 13  of the Charter "" (p. 779).

Carthy J.A. also noted that an absolute right to silence could be manipulated by accused persons tried separately.  He suggested that it would not be possible to distinguish between a subpoena issued by the Crown, and one issued by an accused person, for Charter  purposes.  He then noted two points made by counsel for R.J.S.:  first, that a subpoena issued by an accused protects the right to make full answer and defence; second, that any right to silence must be protected at the moment of compulsion and not at a later trial.
     According to Carthy J.A., the s. 7  structure proposed by counsel for R.J.S. would compel the court to uphold a subpoena issued on behalf of an accused, even though this would impose a breach of Charter  rights upon a separately charged witness.  Carthy J.A. suggested that, once a breach is imposed, only a stay or an assurance of immunity for the witness could remedy the breach.  He held that this result ""would clearly be an unacceptable consequence of any formula of fundamental justice and would encourage manipulation of the system by co-accuseds"" (p. 780).
     Carthy J.A. concluded by noting that a contrary result was reached in Praisoody, supra.  However, he expressed ""no view as to the correctness of that decision, depending as it does on a balancing in a different context than that of a trial"" (p. 780), and instead expressed a preference for the result in R. v. Morra (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 202 (Gen. Div.).


page 478


     Carthy J.A. allowed the Crown's appeal and ordered a new trial.
     IV.  Issues
     The appellant's notice of appeal to this Court states a question of law comparable to the narrow question posed at the outset.  Therefore, only one question is squarely before this Court, and it can be stated in the following general terms:
     Is a person separately charged with an offence compellable as a witness in the criminal trial of another person charged with that same offence, or would compellability in this context violate s. 7  of the Charter ?
     In answering this general question, regard will be had to the following constitutional questions stated on July 19, 1993:
     1.[Does] s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 , infringe[] s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?
     2.If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, is the limitation one which is reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?
     In passing, however, I note that the parties contest two additional points which are necessarily incidental to the larger questions of law stated above.  First, the Crown asks whether it is proper for R.J.S. to raise a right to silence or testimonial privilege which is personal to the witness J.P.M., as a ground of appeal.  Second, R.J.S. asks whether it was appropriate for the Court of Appeal to order a new trial since the Crown chose not to call the property officer.  I will return to these subsidiary issues at the end of these reasons.
     V.  Analysis
     A.  Introduction
     The appellant's contention is that s. 7  of the Charter  operates to prevent J.P.M. from being compelled as a witness in the appellant's criminal  


page 479

trial.  Although other sections of the Charter  are invoked to support this contention, especially ss. 11 (c) and 13 , it is not suggested that these other sections have any direct role to play in precluding compellability per se.  In other words, if the Charter  is to keep J.P.M. off the stand, it will only be because  of s. 7 .
     Section 7  establishes that ""[e]veryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"".  An analysis under this provision can logically proceed in stages.  First, it can be determined whether there exists a real or imminent deprivation of an interest or interests recognized in the section.  Second, the relevant principles of fundamental justice can be isolated, and the deprivation can be measured against these principles to determine whether s. 7  has been infringed.  I will consider each stage in turn.
     Before doing so, however, it may be helpful to state my eventual conclusions up front.  In particular, I will note immediately below that a statutory compulsion to testify engages the liberty interest of s. 7 .  However, I will proceed to suggest that the liberty interest is affected in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  In this case, no principle of fundamental justice demands that J.P.M. should have a right to silence or a privilege against self-incrimination.  That is, J.P.M. is properly compellable on the facts.  Fundamental justice is satisfied because neither J.P.M.'s testimony, nor a limited class of evidence derived from his testimony, can be later used to incriminate him in other proceedings (save for proceedings in respect of perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence).
     These are conclusions which can and will, no doubt, be criticized because the issues involved are difficult and on which reasonable persons will differ.  Indeed, if an unrestricted policy choice were available to design a system capable of protecting  


page 480

Canadians against self-incrimination, one might design a system different from the one reflected in my conclusions; then again, one might not.  However, as I will proceed to explain, I believe that a particular system of protection was consciously selected by those who framed the Charter .  While I will repeatedly acknowledge other theoretical approaches to self-incrimination in these reasons, and while many such approaches are sustainable, it is my opinion that, at the end of the day, only one such approach finds favour in the language and structure of the Charter .
     B.  The Liberty Interest
     Section 7  of the Charter  is engaged by deprivations in respect of life, liberty, or security of the person.  To date, this Court has recognized that an interest is subject to deprivation, in this context, if there is either an immediate or imminent threat to the interest, and, in this appeal, the interest at stake is liberty.  For example, both imprisonment and an imminent threat of imprisonment constitute deprivations of the liberty interest:  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, and R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.
     With respect to the concept of liberty, it is germane to observe that the liberty interest may be engaged although there is no coincident deprivation in respect of the other s. 7  interests, life or security of the person:  Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177.  Moreover, I observe that not every restriction on absolute freedom constitutes a deprivation of liberty for s. 7 :  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at p. 524 (per Wilson J.), and R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at pp. 785-86 (per Dickson C.J.).
     It is in this context that the compulsion to speak must be considered.  In Thomson Newspapers, supra, where this context was recognized, a majority of this Court held that such compulsion somehow engages the liberty interest.  I use the word  


page 481

""somehow"" advisedly in the last sentence, since I believe the exact manner of its engagement was left unclear by Thomson Newspapers.  As an initial task, therefore, I believe it is necessary to comment upon the relationship between the liberty interest and the compellability of a witness.
     The provision challenged in Thomson Newspapers was s. 17 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, which established, in part, the authority to compel testimony from ""any person resident or present in Canada"".  That is, the appellants in Thomson Newspapers challenged a subpoena power.  Like an ordinary subpoena power, the power invested in the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was associated with the Commission's ability to enforce statutory compliance using ""all powers that are exercised by any superior court in Canada for the enforcement of subpoenas to witnesses or punishment of disobedience thereof"":  s. 17(1).  In other words, the constitutional challenge mounted in Thomson Newspapers was directed toward a subpoena power enforceable by contempt proceedings.
     Five members of this Court heard the appeal in Thomson Newspapers, and each wrote separate reasons.  Of these five, four held that s. 17 of the Combines Investigation Act engaged the liberty interest, but these four split evenly on the question whether the subpoena power infringed fundamental justice.  The fifth, Lamer J. (as he then was), reasoned that it was not appropriate to focus on the subpoena power at the expense of a direct constitutional challenge to s. 20(2) of the Combines Investigation Act.  That provision, like s. 5(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act , is silent on the question whether a person can be compelled to speak.  It is a provision concerned only with the kind of speech which may be compelled.


page 482


     The distinction between a compulsion to speak, and a compulsion to speak in response to particular questions, was well drawn by Lamer J.  He stated (at p. 443):
     In this case, no one is suggesting that the contempt power or the Criminal Code  offences for which a recalcitrant witness may be prosecuted offend the principles of fundamental justice.  What can only be argued, irrespective of the parties' approach, is that s. 17  violates s. 7  of the Charter  to the extent that it enables a Commissioner to punish for contempt a witness who refuses to give an answer to a question put to him, on the ground that it may tend to incriminate him.  Section 17  empowers generally to punish for contempt witnesses who refuse to answer.  That does not violate s. 7 .  It is s. 20 , in fact the first few lines of s. 20(2)  which takes away the common law right to refuse to give incriminatory answers, that brings the refusal to answer within contempt and that really triggers the violation.  [Emphasis in original.]
     It was this distinction which motivated Lamer J. to resolve the appeal in Thomson Newspapers without regard for the compellability issue.  In the absence of a direct attack on s. 20(2) of the Combines Investigation Act, Lamer J. refused to be led ""into inferentially pronouncing upon s. 5(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act "", especially given that a challenge to s. 5(1)  ""would have attracted different interventions from the Attorneys General"" (at p. 445).
     Thus, the question which underlies the apparent disagreement in Thomson Newspapers asks whether the proper focus of attack in a case such as the present one is a subpoena power on the one hand, or s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  on the other, the latter of which purports to abolish the common-law privilege against self-incrimination:  see Di Iorio v. Warden of the Montreal Jail, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 152, at p. 219, and Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p. 362.  But does this question not promote a somewhat circular analysis?  Perhaps it is not possible to determine the proper focus of attack before one determines how the  


page 483

Charter  will respond to problems of compelled speech.
     On the one hand, a witness who claims a complete right to silence might legitimately challenge a subpoena power.  In effect, such a witness denies the very essence of a subpoena, namely, the direction that a person can ""be examined upon oath"":  Combines Investigation Act, s. 17(1).  On the other hand, if the Charter  protects the witness using any mechanism short of an absolute right to silence, then the focus logically shifts to whatever statutory authority compels the sworn witness to answer.  Stated another way, the focus shifts from the fact of compelled speech, to the nature of compelled speech.
     In Thomson Newspapers, supra, different Charter  outcomes led naturally to different points of focus.  Both Wilson and Sopinka JJ. held the state could not compel self-incriminatory speech in the circumstances there considered, such that s. 17 of the Combines Investigation Act, the subpoena power, was a proper and complete remedial target.  Section 20(2) , the abolition of the common-law privilege, although not irrelevant to their discussion, became irrelevant as a constitutional target once the power to compel testimony was rejected.
     The opposite was true for L'Heureux-Dubé and La Forest JJ.  In their reasons, the subpoena power targeted by the appellants prompted a primary rejection of an absolute right to silence, and a consequential analysis of the kind of speech which can be compelled from a witness who takes the stand.  Although such a consequential analysis probably involved s. 20(2) of the Combines Investigation Act by necessary implication, in view of the conclusions L'Heureux-Dubé and La Forest JJ. reached about the propriety of provisions like s. 20(2), it was perhaps unnecessary for them to highlight its inferential role in their examination of the liberty interest.


page 484


     Finally, Lamer J. objected to the structure of the appeal in Thomson Newspapers, but did not otherwise finally pronounce upon the proper target of a s. 7  challenge.  Although he indicated that s. 20(2) should have been challenged, this position was premised upon the assumption ""that it is and has long been in Canada a principle of fundamental justice that a witness may refuse to give an incriminating answer"" (p. 442).  If a different assumption had been made, namely, that a principle of fundamental justice suggests that there is an absolute right to silence, then s. 20(2) might naturally have been relevant for him in remedial terms.  I reiterate that Lamer J. concerned himself with the structure of the appeal in Thomson Newspapers.  He voiced his concern by making the first assumption noted above, but in no way precluded himself from adopting the latter.
     All of which is to say that, in my view, a case which broadly asks questions about witness compellability tends to involve an encroachment upon liberty which is initially defined by a subpoena power, and which may be further defined by a provision like s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , but this further definition depends upon one's ultimate Charter  conclusions.  In view of the opinion I will ultimately render, I believe that s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  is the more important focus in respect of the liberty-interest deprivation in this appeal, and it is that provision which is the subject of the constitutional questions dated July 19, 1993.  Although no constitutional question has been stated in respect of the subpoena power, I regard that deficiency as of purely academic interest, first, because of the view I ultimately take of the case, and, second, because this appeal was heard along with British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch
1
.  Branch involves a direct challenge to a subpoena power.  By consolidating these appeals,  


page 485

sufficient notice was given to the Attorneys General regarding the kinds of provisions in jeopardy.
     To conclude, I reiterate that Thomson Newspapers, supra, is authority for the proposition that a statutory compulsion to testify constitutes a deprivation of liberty.  Thomson Newspapers in no way precludes the further refinement of this liberty-interest holding to embrace the concern articulated by Lamer J. in that case.  A deprivation of liberty may arise by virtue of a compulsion to speak per se, but that deprivation may be particularized if one's approach to the Charter  requires one to reach conclusions regarding the kind of speech which is compelled.
     I note that if one particularizes the liberty-interest deprivation to include an analysis of the character of compelled speech, this refinement in no way changes the temporal focus of s. 7 .  If one examines the self-incriminatory character of speech, then one's attention is naturally drawn to the prospect of subsequent prosecution.  However, this does not mean that the liberty interest is engaged in relation to that prospect.  As A. W. Mewett has stated in ""The Right to Silence"" (1990), 32 Crim. L.Q. 273, at p. 274, ""if it is true that being under compulsion to obey a subpoena is a deprivation of liberty, then the time to consider fundamental justice is at the time of the compulsion, not later when it may be too late"".  In other words, the encroachment upon liberty is complete at the moment of compelled speech, regardless of its character.  D. Stratas, in The Charter of Rights  in Litigation (1990), vol. I, has noted that an uncertainty which currently exists is ""just how immediate a threatened deprivation of liberty must be"" (p. 17-2.1).  Inasmuch as a statutory compulsion to give oral testimony engages the liberty interest, it is unnecessary to resolve this uncertainty today.  When J.P.M. challenged the subpoena in this case, he faced an imminent deprivation of liberty.

     C.  The Principles of Fundamental Justice
     1.  Introduction
     The rights listed in s. 7  of the Charter  are not guaranteed at large.  Although J.P.M.'s liberty interest is engaged by the fact of testimonial compulsion, it does not follow that s. 7  will provide relief.  J.P.M. cannot claim an abstract right to liberty.  He can only demand that a deprivation of his liberty take place in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.  As Lamer J. stated in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, the principles of fundamental justice ""set the parameters of that right"" (p. 512).
     In the discussion to follow, I will conclude that the principle of fundamental justice which is operative in the present appeal is the principle against self-incrimination.  It is against this principle that the fact of testimonial compulsion must be measured.  In reaching this conclusion, I acknowledge that I will largely follow the course already charted by Lamer C.J. in R. v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, and R. v. Jones, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229.
     In Jones, Lamer C.J. dissented on the question whether dangerous offender proceedings serve to ""incriminate"" further a person who has already been convicted of an offence.  I regard his dissent as limited to that issue, such that his discussion of self-incrimination otherwise generally reflects Canadian law.  In particular, I note that Lamer C.J. in Jones reviewed disparate jurisprudential topics and concluded that ""the principle against self-incrimination is a principle of fundamental justice and this Court has, at least implicitly, recognized its status as such"" (p. 257).  To this point I would merely add that the Chief Justice's majority opinion in P. (M.B.), supra, discusses a point of criminal procedure not considered in Jones, and gives explicit recognition to the principle against self-incrimination (p. 577).


page 487


     Thus, I acknowledge that P. (M.B.) and Jones have, so to speak, cleared the path I will follow in these reasons.  However, I do not believe it would be sufficient for me simply to cite those cases here and move on.  In all of its aspects, this appeal is intimately associated with the idea of self-incrimination broadly conceived.  Moreover, the various protections against self-incrimination promote troubling terminological confusion.   Ratushny has stated:
     The idea of the right against self-incrimination has been expressed in a variety of ways:  ""privilege against self-incrimination"", ""right to remain silent"", ""nemo tenetur seipsum prodere"", ""nemo tenetur seipsum accusare"", ""nemo tenetur armare adversarum contra se"".  More recently, the Canadian Bill of Rights adopted the term ""self-crimination"".  No useful purpose is served in attempting to ascribe a precise meaning to one of the phrases in comparison to another.  The scope of this inquiry will encompass all matters which could be said to be related to the concept of self-incrimination in its broadest sense so that all of these phrases are enveloped.
     (Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process (1979), at p. 2.)
     Like  Ratushny, I must embark upon a discussion of various matters ""which could be said to be related to the concept of self-incrimination in its broadest sense"", and, in doing so, I wish to heed the admonition that one ""bears a heavy responsibility to be as precise as possible"" when one discusses self-incrimination:  D. M. Paciocco, Charter Principles and Proof in Criminal Cases (1987), at p. 539.  To achieve both goals, I thus consider it advisable to discuss the principle against self-incrimination in general terms at the outset, notwithstanding the helpful direction of P. (M.B.), supra, and Jones, supra.
     To commence my analysis, however, I note that in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, Lamer J. set forth the guiding thought that ""the principles of fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles, not only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal system"" (p. 512).  Therefore, to explain why the  


page 488

principle against self-incrimination is a principle of fundamental justice, I should examine the basic tenets of our legal system.  These tenets may be reflected in the common-law and statutory environment which exists outside of the Charter , they may be reflected in the specific and enumerated provisions of the Charter , or they may be more expansive than either of these:  see Hebert, supra, at pp. 162-64.  To begin my analysis, however, I think it will be sufficient for me to examine first self-incrimination protections apart from the Charter  and then to turn my attention upon the Charter  itself.  Once that is done, I will be better placed to determine what the principle demands in respect of a statutory testimonial compulsion.
     2.  Protections Against Self-Incrimination Outside of the Charter 
     The protections against self-incrimination which exist apart from the Charter  compose a topic of enormous scope.  Indeed, before the Charter  was proclaimed, at least one entire book investigated these protections:  see Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra.  My goals are more modest, however, and the discussion to follow will embrace three subjects.  First, I will review the history of the testimonial privileges.  This review will canvass the common-law privilege against self-incrimination for witnesses, the common-law non-compellability of an accused person, and the status of these concepts in other jurisdictions and in pre-Charter Canada.  Second, I will review the confessions rule with a view to determining the extent to which the confessions rule is relevant to a principle against self-incrimination.  Finally, I will consider policy arguments which have been advanced to account for these protections.
     (a)  The Testimonial Privileges 
     I cannot begin to comment upon the testimonial privileges without confining the inquiry.  As Professor Mewett has rightly admonished, ""[p]erhaps no phrase is bandied about with more imprecision and with more unawareness of its legal and social  


page 489

significance than the privilege against self-incrimination"":  ""Law Enforcement and the Conflict of Values"" (1970), 12 Crim. L.Q. 179, at p. 186.  The first point to note, therefore, is that I discuss here only the privileges against self-incrimination, and not, except by implication, the larger principle against self-incrimination which otherwise dominates my s. 7  investigation.
     The privilege and the principle must be kept distinct.  In Thomson Newspapers, supra, Sopinka J. stated that ""[a] privilege is an exclusionary rule of evidence which is appropriately asserted in court"" (p. 599); see also, Hebert, supra, at p. 195.  In other words, a privilege is an evidentiary rule which operates in court to render otherwise relevant and probative evidence inadmissible, generally for policy reasons:  see R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 263, at p. 288.  The principle is something else.  In Jones, supra, Lamer C.J. isolated the critical point when he stated:  ""The principle is a general organizing principle of criminal law from which particular rules can be derived. . . .  The privilege is merely one rule that has been derived from the principle"" (p. 249 (emphasis in original)).
     I proceed, then, to consider only the common-law privilege against self-incrimination, along with its origins and modern status.  As I will describe below, the privilege embraces two different yet related rules:  first, the privilege of a witness not to answer questions which might tend to incriminate that witness; second, the non-compellability of an accused person.
     To search for the origins of the privilege against self-incrimination is to embark upon a perilous journey.  Dean Wigmore introduced the privilege's ""long story"" by commenting upon the ""complicated task"" ahead of him, an understatement which should stand as a warning to those who lack Wigmore's formidable expertise and skills:  Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), [sect  ]2250, at p. 269.  It is a warning that I heed; even  


page 490

more, it is a warning which makes me wonder whether the historical journey is worth the price.
     In Thomson Newspapers, Wilson J. relied upon Wigmore's analysis to suggest that the privilege against self-incrimination has its origins in ""a revulsion against the practices of the courts of the Star Chamber and the High Commission in the seventeenth century"" (p. 471).  It is probably fair to state that this account rests upon an emotional touchstone of the common law, embracing as it does the facts of Lilburn's trial:  The Trial of John Lilburn and John Wharton, for Printing and Publishing Seditious Books (1637), 3 How. State Tr. 1316.  In Wigmore's account of that trial, Lilburn offers these stirring words ([sect  ]2250, at p. 283):
     I am not willing to answer you to any more of these questions, because I see you go about by this examination to ensnare me; for, seeing the things for which I am imprisoned cannot be proved against me, you will get other matter out of my examination; and therefore, if you will not ask me about the thing laid to my charge, I shall answer no more.
     Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers, again in reliance upon Wigmore, describes how Lilburn's objection was not aimed at the mere possibility of self-incriminatory speech, but rather at the lack of specificity in the indictment he faced.  Wilson J. suggests, however, that ""through the effluxion of time, the underlying rationale for the rights became blurred"" (p. 471), such that a much broader privilege against self-incrimination was born.
     In questioning whether this historical journey is worth its price, I do not in any way impugn the approach of Wigmore or of Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers.  Rather, I simply believe that an analysis of the privilege's origin is more amenable to an historical inquiry than to a legal one.  In this regard, I note that there are at least three competing explanations for the development of the privilege against self-incrimination, one of which postulates that the privilege was available to witnesses  


page 491

long before Lilburn's trial:  M. R. T. MacNair, ""The Early Development of the Privilege against Self-Incrimination"" (1990), 10 Oxford J. Legal Stud. 66.  The point is this:  as I will discuss in greater detail below, policy explanations for rules against self-incrimination have arisen largely as ad hoc developments in our law, and one should not be misled into adopting a policy explanation in toto simply because the explanation fits well with an emotional view of history which is not, itself, susceptible to final proof.
     Therefore, the more useful investigation does not attempt to define the privilege against self-incrimination as a product of certain historical forces.  Rather, it attempts only to define the rules which developed at common law, since rules can be known with some certainty.  By adopting this approach, it becomes quickly apparent that the focus should be on that common-law rule which recognizes a privilege against self-incrimination for witnesses who are compelled to testify.  Lamb v. Munster (1882), 10 Q.B.D. 110, at pp. 112-13, is a frequently cited authority for the common-law privilege:
     [T]he privilege extends to protect a man from answering any question which ""would in the opinion of the judge have a tendency to expose the witness, or the wife or husband of the witness, to any criminal charge"". . . . The extent of the privilege is I think this:  the man may say, ""If you are going to bring a criminal charge, or if I have reason to think a criminal charge is going to be brought against me, I will hold my tongue.  Prove what you can, but I am protected from furnishing evidence against myself out of my own mouth.""
     The privilege is a privilege not to give answers which tend to incriminate the witness.  It is a dormant giant who can be awakened in proceedings which are not perceived to involve its express statutory abridgement:  see, e.g.,  Bell v. Klein, [1954] 1 D.L.R. 225 (B.C.S.C.), and Brown v. Hooper (1885), 3 Man. R. 86 (Q.B.).


page 492


     Moreover, it is true that the common-law privilege did not simply protect a witness's testimony.  Derivative evidence, that is, evidence which may come to light as a result of a compelled disclosure, was implicitly protected because a witness could claim the privilege not only in relation to facts which were directly incriminatory, but also in relation to so-called ""clue facts"".  Wigmore defined a ""clue fact"" as being a fact ""which increases the probability that a subordinate fact will be discovered and thus that an ultimate fact, and the crime, will be proved"" (supra, [sect  ]2260, at p. 371).  Although his summary notes that some early cases rejected clue-fact protection, it also notes that most modern cases do not (p. 372).
     For the witness, then, the privilege operated as a potentially broad protection which could be asserted on the stand.  With respect to the accused person, however, the common law took a different approach.  This is so because the accused had more than simply a right to refuse to give self-incriminatory answers.  The accused could refuse testimony altogether.  The accused's right was a right against compellability.  To delve once more into legal history, it may be that the accused's non-compellability can be linked to the pre-17th century status of accused persons.  At that time, an accused could not take an oath in the common-law courts because the oath was a decisive thing.  The accused was to be tried by the oaths of the jurors, not by his own:  Wigmore, supra, [sect  ]2250, at p. 285.
     Whatever its origin, however, non-compellability as an aspect of the privilege against self-incrimination appeared long ago as a judge-made rule. But this extension of the rule was far from dramatic.   Ratushny, supra, has stated (at p. 173):
     [I]n the second half of the seventeenth century, the rule came to be established, in judicial decisions, that a person could not be compelled to be a witness in his trial even where a proper accusation was present.  The exact process by which this rule developed is difficult to pinpoint.  However, the extension of the privilege would  


page 493

not be difficult since it had little practical consequence for the accused.  The accused was not competent as a witness until 1898.  In other words, he needed no protection against being compelled to testify in the common law courts.  He could not testify even if he wished to do so.  [Emphasis in original.]
     It is perhaps the interaction between the privilege against self-incrimination and the testimonial incompetence of accused persons in the common-law courts which led to the somewhat anomalous rule of non-compellability.
     In particular, it is, at first blush, anomalous to equate a rule of non-compellability with a testimonial privilege, since a privilege by definition is an exclusionary rule ordinarily asserted on the stand.  As Wigmore stated with regard to this problem, ""the prosecution could nevertheless on principle have a right at least to call [the accused] to be sworn because, as with an ordinary witness, it could not be known beforehand whether he would exercise his privilege"" (supra, [sect  ]2268, at p. 406 (emphasis in original)).  With rare exceptions (e.g., R. v. Pantelidis, [1943] 1 D.L.R. 569 (B.C.C.A.)),  however, the accused's privilege against self-incrimination at common law has not required assertion by the accused.  The privilege was embodied in the expanded rule of non-compellability.
     To summarize briefly, I note that, in Canada, the privilege against self-incrimination at common law means only two things:  the privilege claimable by a witness, and the non-compellability of an accused person.  That is, the privilege is limited by its testimonial character.  This was definitively established by Marcoux v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R 763, where it was argued that an accused's participation in a police line-up engaged the privilege.  Dickson J. (as he then was) rejected the argument in these terms (at pp. 768-69):


page 494


     The limit of the privilege against self-incrimination is clear.  The privilege is the privilege of a witness not to answer a question which may incriminate him.
     . . .
     As applied to witnesses generally, the privilege must be expressly claimed by the witness, when the question is put to him in the witness box. . . . As applied to an accused, the privilege is the right to stand mute.  An accused cannot be asked, much less compelled, to enter the witness box or to answer incriminating questions.  If he chooses to testify, the protective shield, of course, disappears.  In short, the privilege extends to the accused qua witness and not qua accused, it is concerned with testimonial compulsion specifically and not with compulsion generally. . . .
     This point has been reiterated on a number of occasions:  e.g.,  Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 683 (per Lamer J.); Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 599 (per Sopinka J.); Hebert, supra, at pp. 173 (per McLachlin J.) and 195 (per Sopinka J.).
     To state, however, that the common-law privilege against self-incrimination can be defined by two rules in Canada, is not to say that the Canadian position has been fully explored.  Indeed, in order to understand the Canadian experience, it is essential for me to examine the statutory intervention which has affected these rules.
     In this regard, I first note that the non-compellability rule has been largely unaffected by history.  This lack of interference has not been universal, inasmuch as there are instances of its statutory abridgement:  e.g.,  R. v. Fee (1887), 13 O.R. 590 (Ch. Div.); see also S. Schiff, Evidence in the Litigation Process (4th ed. 1993), vol. 2, at pp. 1343-44.  However, abridgement has been rare, and, more to the point, the history of statutory interference with the witness's privilege saw the accused's privilege expressly affirmed by Parliament.
     To explain this last point, I cite (in part) the original forerunner of s. 5(1) of the Canada   


page 495

Evidence Act, namely, s. 4 of The Canada Evidence Act, 1893, S.C. 1893, c. 31.  That provision read:
     4.  Every person charged with an offence, and the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, shall be a competent witness, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly with any other person.
     On its face, s. 4 purported to affect only the testimonial competence of accused persons.  However, in Gosselin v. The King (1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, this Court held that s. 4 rendered accused persons not only competent, but also compellable by the prosecution.  In reaching this conclusion, the Court was influenced by the wording of an English statute, the Criminal Evidence Act, 1898 (U.K.), 61 & 62 Vict., c. 36, s. 1, which made accused persons and spouses competent witnesses ""for the defence"".  The Court considered the absence of these three words in the Canadian Act to be important.  Notably, however, the brief threat to non-compellability posed by Gosselin was undone when these words were added by amendment a few years later:  An Act further to amend The Canada Evidence Act, 1893, S.C. 1906, c. 10, s. 1.  In the result, as  Ratushny has obliquely noted, ""the non-compellability of an accused was specifically adopted in Canada by the implied incorporation of a common law principle"":  E. Ratushny, ""Is There a Right Against Self-Incrimination in Canada?"" (1973), 19 McGill L.J. 1, at p. 30 (emphasis in original).
     Thus, it can be properly said that pre-Charter Canada witnessed the retention of the common-law privilege against self-incrimination as it applied to accused persons.  However, the same is not true of the witness's privilege since the Canada Evidence Act , quoted above, abolished this privilege in Canada in so far as it could (the effect was made largely complete by complementary provincial provisions):  see Di Iorio, supra, and Dubois, supra.  In its place, the Act afforded witnesses a limited form of immunity applicable not at the moment of compelled testimony, but rather in  


page 496

respect of subsequent proceedings.  This approach survives in s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act .  Pursuant to s. 5(2) , if protection is claimed by a witness, that witness's self-incriminatory answers cannot ""be used or admissible in evidence against [the witness] in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury"".
     The Canadian approach can be contrasted to the approach of other systems.  Most obviously, it can be contrasted to the constitutional status of the privilege against self-incrimination in the United States.  In that country, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in part that ""[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"".  That language, as Wigmore has discussed in depth, ""protects a witness as well as an accused party"":  supra, [sect  ]2252, at p. 326.  That is, in the United States, both the accused person and the witness benefit from a constitutionalized version of the common-law privilege against self-incrimination.  It is this constitutional status which has driven the American experience with immunity statutes and the concepts of simple-use, derivative-use, and transactional immunity.  These are matters which I will further address below.
     The Canadian approach can also be contrasted to the approach in England.  In that country, there is no statutory abrogation of the common-law privilege comparable to s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act .  However, it does not follow that the common-law status of the testimonial privileges has persisted unmodified in that country.  In Thomson Newspapers, supra, after Wilson J. completed her review of the common-law privilege against self-incrimination, she asserted that ""[t]his remains the law of England to this day"" (p. 473).  I agree with her assertion as far as it goes -- that is, I agree that the common-law privilege remains available in England -- but I would not go so far  


page 497

as to imply that the privilege is uniformly available.  In J. D. Heydon, ""Statutory Restrictions on the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination"" (1971), 87 L.Q.R. 214, the author considers a variety of statutory compulsions which have historically abrogated the common-law position.  Heydon states (at pp. 215-16):
     The problem is of some practical importance, for statutes of the type to be considered are common.  They apply to the public examinations of bankrupts and of company officials in winding-up proceedings; to officials investigating liability to taxation; to inquiries into bribery and other election offences; to inquiries by parliamentary committees; to police questioning with respect to certain offences; to investigations of such matters as gambling, and corrupt war-contracting; and in many other areas as well.
     Moreover, Heydon describes how these statutory inroads have not been accompanied by uniform immunity protections.  In the result, I regard the English position as resting somewhere in between the Canadian and American positions, inasmuch as the common-law privilege has not always been available in England, and inasmuch as it has not always been replaced by a co-extensive immunity.
     The spectrum of national approaches demonstrates to my mind the importance of focusing on the Canadian system in any examination of the common-law testimonial privileges.  Some are too quick to assume that the Canadian system is Draconian when compared to the American and English models.  But surely the constitutional status of the American system, and the historical complexity of the English system, are not matters to be lightly ignored.  And, moreover, we should not quickly assume that the balance of power in Canada has been tipped in favour of the state regarding witness compellability.  In the report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections, Toward Unity:  Criminal Justice and Corrections (1969), at p. 68, there exists the following much-quoted statement regarding Canadian immunity protection:


page 498


     A searching examination may, however, elicit facts or clues which enable the case to be independently proved.  Thus the abolition of the privilege of a witness to refuse to answer on the ground that his answer may tend to incriminate him places an additional and powerful weapon in the hands of law enforcement.  [Emphasis in original.]
     The absence of clue-fact protection in pre-Charter Canada is a legitimate point of focus.  However, the absence of this protection does not necessarily suggest that Canada has been unsuccessful in maintaining a healthy degree of protection for witnesses.  It is intriguing to note, for example, that there is quantitative support for the idea that s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  more effectively protects witnesses than does the common-law privilege:  Report of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982), at p. 439.

And, finally, Canada's approach to the common-law privilege should not be treated as a theoretical anomaly.  Various positions abound.  Testimonial privileges, non-compellability, and related issues like pre-trial silence, were all subject to the will of Parliament in the pre-Charter  era:  Attorney General of Quebec and Keable v. Attorney General of Canada, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 218, at p. 258 (per Estey J.).  It is no surprise, therefore, to discover Canadian academics and judges debating such points as whether accused persons should have been made compellable witnesses for the prosecution in the decade before the Charter 's proclamation:  see E. Haines (View I), and A. Maloney and P. V. Tomlinson (View II), ""Future of the Law of Evidence -- The Right to Remain Silent -- Two Views"", in R. E. Salhany and R. J. Carter, eds., Studies in Canadian Criminal Evidence (1972), 321.  And, equally, although I have focused on the testimonial privileges here, it is germane to note that the question of pre-trial silence has prompted a range of proposals, some of which are at extreme odds with the Canada Evidence Act :  see, e.g.,  Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (U.K.), 1994, c. 33; and S. Greer, ""The Right to Silence:  A Review of the Current Debate"" (1990), 53 Mod. L. Rev.  


page 499

709.  Clearly, ideas of self-incrimination have prompted diverse legislative responses.
     I will return below to such questions of philosophy.  For the present, it is sufficient to conclude that the common law recognizes a privilege for witnesses against self-incrimination, along with a privilege for accused persons in the form of testimonial non-compellability.  These are the testimonial privileges.  In Canada, the latter rule remains largely untouched by statute, whereas the former has undergone significant theoretical modification which makes inter-jurisdictional comparisons difficult.  Having made these points, I turn to consider briefly a related issue:  the confessions rule.
     (b)  The Confessions Rule
     In Jones, supra, Lamer C.J. discussed the confessions rule only briefly before concluding that the rule is ""grounded in the principle against self-incrimination"" (p. 252).  The confessions rule, of course, operates to exclude pre-trial statements made to persons in authority which are not made freely and voluntarily.  The traditional rule derives from Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), and has been the subject of many appeals to this Court, most recently in R. v. Whittle, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914.  In Jones, Lamer C.J. did not elaborate upon his conclusion.  For the sake of clarity, I consider it advisable to do so here.
     In particular, any effort to rationalize the confessions rule using a self-incrimination penumbra must be historically qualified.  That is so because the confessions rule only partakes of a self-incrimination principle to the extent that it is founded upon more than a concern for the trustworthiness of statements.  Wigmore has compared the confessions rule to the common-law privilege against self-incrimination in these terms:


page 500


     A distinction of the two rules on grounds of principle is no longer easy.  The original confession rule -- that involuntary confessions are excluded on grounds of untrustworthiness -- was obviously based on principle almost entirely unrelated to that of the privilege. . . . Until recently, the relationship between the privilege and the confession rule could be found only in the general spirit of protection and caution which our legal system shows toward an accused. . . . There was no more reason for linking the privilege with the confession rule than with the others.  [Emphasis in original.]
     (Wigmore, supra, [sect  ]2266, at pp. 401-2.)
     In the passage above, Wigmore was speaking of common-law systems generally, and of the United States in particular.  In Canada, a rationale for the confessions rule extending beyond trustworthiness has not always been easy to locate:  see Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 98.
     Indeed, the difficulty of this search occupied McLachlin J.'s attention in Hebert, supra.  After a review of the authorities, she was left to conclude that, as a result of R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, the fairness rationale for the confessions rule in pre-Charter Canada created only ""a strong and continuing undercurrent of dissent"" (p. 172).  While she suggested that the common-law confessions rule is associated with ""the right to freely choose whether or not to make a statement to the police"" (p. 173), she explained this association in the following terms (at p. 173):
     This idea is accompanied by a correlative concern with the repute and integrity of the judicial process.  This theme has not always been ascendant.  Yet, its importance cannot be denied.  It persists, both in Canadian jurisprudence and in the rules governing the rights of suspects in other countries.
     In reliance upon these considerations, McLachlin J. proceeded to postulate that there is a principle of fundamental justice within s. 7  of the Charter  to the effect that ""a person whose liberty is placed in jeopardy by the criminal process cannot be  


page 501

required to give evidence against himself or herself, but rather has the right to choose whether to speak or to remain silent"" (p. 175).  But, and I highlight this point, she indicated that this right to silence under the Charter  ""must extend beyond the narrow view of the confessions rule which formed the basis of the decision of the majority of this Court in Rothman"" (p. 175 (emphasis added)).  Although she proceeded to align the confessions rule with this right (at pp. 181-82), thus demonstrating a kind of synergy between the common-law and Charter  jurisprudence, her review of history conclusively demonstrates that during much of Canada's history, the confessions rule had little to do with ideas of self-incrimination.
     In this respect, then, it may be misleading to assert, in unqualified terms, that the confessions rule is grounded in a principle against self-incrimination.  While this is true in a modern sense, it is only true historically if one adopts the language used by McLachlin J. in Hebert.  That is, it is historically true in the sense that protection against self-incrimination is a recurring theme, or even a ""leitmotif"" (p. 167), in the confessions rule cases, as opposed to an organizing principle which can explain the past decisions of this Court.  As stated by Sopinka J. in Whittle, supra, with reference to the reliability rationale, ""a strong undercurrent developed which also supported the rule in part on fairness in the criminal process"" (p. 932).  In this case, we should not confuse the undercurrent with the current itself.  Nor should we overlook the fact that the extension of the common-law position in Hebert was perhaps motivated by conditions existing within the Charter  itself, as I will explain below.
     (c)Policy
     I have so far discussed the protections against self-incrimination which exist apart from the Charter , but I have not discussed the policy basis for these protections in any significant way.  I have  


page 502

adopted this approach intentionally.  To the extent that we cannot know for certain how and why these protections first arose in history, any policy justification for the existing state of affairs is necessarily ad hoc.  In pre-Charter  terms, the rules were not derived from the principle.  It was the other way around:  see generally Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra.
     Which is not to say that the policy basis of the protections is irrelevant.  On the contrary, as will become apparent later, the same policy basis may explain protections against self-incrimination which exist in the Charter  itself.  In other words, I choose to discuss policy at this stage of the analysis, not because pre-Charter  policy considerations can necessarily be distinguished from the policy basis of Charter  rights, but rather because I wish to emphasize that, prior to the Charter , any self-incrimination policy could do nothing more than partly explain the state of Canadian law.  Wigmore, whose discussion has been fairly characterized as ""[p]erhaps the most comprehensive and balanced survey of the policy basis"" (Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 7), offered this introduction:
     There is no agreement as to the policy of the privilege against self-incrimination.  This is partly because there is no ""the"" privilege.  It is many things in as many settings.  The privilege is a prerogative of a defendant not to take the stand in his own prosecution; it is also an option of a witness not to disclose self-incriminating knowledge in a criminal case, and in a civil case, and before a grand jury and legislative committee and administrative tribunal.  It is alleged by some to apply to suppress substances removed from the body, to confessions, and to facts tending to disgrace. . . . Suggestions as to the policy of ""the"" privilege are lurking in all of these settings and more.  [Cross-references omitted.]
     (Wigmore, supra, [sect  ]2251, at pp. 296-97.)
     I have already noted that, in Canada, the common-law privilege against self-incrimination has a testimonial character, such that Wigmore's  


page 503

reference to bodily substances can be set aside:  Marcoux, supra.  Similarly, I have qualified the proposition that there has always been a clear relationship between the Canadian confessions rule and a principle against self-incrimination.  And, of course, I have noted that the privilege itself was legislatively transformed in this country over a century ago.
     These factors notwithstanding, it is fair to suppose that Wigmore's discussion of policy retains a relevance for Canada.  The rule of an accused's non-compellability retains its common-law truth, the confessions rule has always had an undercurrent related to the common-law privilege, and while the privilege has been abrogated in Canada, there is good reason to believe that the offsetting immunity protection was intended to respond to the same policy as the privilege it replaced.  What, then, is this policy?
     Wigmore's discussion advanced twelve possible justifications for the privilege against self-incrimination (broadly conceived); see also, Heydon, supra, at pp. 217-21; and Schiff, supra, at pp. 1344-46.  Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, quoted all of these (at pp. 477-78).  Suffice it to say that, of the twelve justifications, Wigmore identified two fundamental ones:
     The first is to remove the right to an answer in the hard cores of instances where compulsion might lead to inhumanity, the principal inhumanity being abusive tactics by a zealous questioner....  The second is to comply with the prevailing ethic that the individual is sovereign and that proper rules of battle between government and individual require that the individual not be bothered for less than good reason and not be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself....
     (Wigmore, supra, [sect  ]2251, at p. 318.)
     In keeping with the approach adopted by Paciocco, supra, I think it is helpful, whenever possible, to discard as irrelevant policy justifications which do not inform a given topic.  Accordingly, since we are dealing here with the topic of statutorily compelled testimony, I leave to one side the policy justification associated with inhumanity.  In modern  


page 504

Canada, abusive tactics have little to do with testimonial compulsion authorized by statute.
     This leaves for consideration only one policy justification, namely, the principle of sovereignty embodied in the idea that individuals should be left alone in the absence of justification, and not conscripted by the state to promote a self-defeating purpose.  I agree with the following statement made by Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 480:
     The state must have some justification for interfering with the individual and cannot rely on the individual to produce the justification out of his own mouth.  Were it otherwise, our justice system would be on a slippery slope towards the creation of a police state.
     To use language which will appear again in my analysis of the Charter , the policy justification for the common-law protections rests upon the idea that the Crown must establish a ""case to meet"".  The ad hoc justification comes to reflect a concern often voiced historically, the idea ""that someone is going to start `poking about in the speculation of finding something chargeable'"":  Mewett, ""Law Enforcement and the Conflict of Values"", supra, at p. 188.
     Thus, it is clearly an abhorrence for self-incrimination which is discernable.  This abhorrence has taken on many a Latin visage in the cases, including nemo tenetur seipsum accusare and nemo tenetur seipsum prodere (essentially, a person shall not be compelled to betray or accuse the self).  In passing, however, I would highlight that these Latin maxims have a checkered past, and tend to lead once again into the troubled realm of the legal historian: see Wigmore, supra, [sect  ]2250, at pp. 268-69, note (2), and at pp. 287-88; Heydon, supra, at p. 216;  Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 169; and, MacNair, supra, at pp. 78-79.   Mewett, for example, characterizes the latter maxim as ""Coke's usual facile adoption of a convenient Latin tag"":  ""Law Enforcement and the Conflict of Values"", supra, at p. 187.  Moreover, since I am investigating policy in a discussion ultimately directed  


page 505

toward identifying the principles of fundamental justice, I shy away from these maxims because Dickson J. in Marcoux, supra, bluntly limited their scope in respect of the testimonial privileges by stating (at p. 768):
     The limit of the privilege against self-incrimination is clear.  The privilege is the privilege of a witness not to answer a question which may incriminate him.  That is all that is meant by the Latin maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, often incorrectly advanced in support of a much broader proposition.
     See also the reasons of Sopinka J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 599.  To state the point more simply, I distinguish between these maxims and the policy justification I have identified.
     In conclusion, I find that the protections existing apart from the Charter  reflect a basic distaste for self-conscription.  The state, and not the accused, should be expected to produce a case.  As an ad hoc explanation, however, this case-to-meet principle necessarily incorporates, or permits, those deviations from it which arose pre-Charter .  It does not rationalize them.  To adopt the refrain from Hebert, supra, the principle has not always been ascendant.  In particular, as I have described it above, the principle recognizes individual sovereignty subject to the proposition that the state may have justification to interfere.  I will consider the scope of that justification below, which in this context equates with the demands of fundamental justice, after I have introduced the protections of the Charter .
     3.  Protections Against Self-Incrimination Within the Charter 
     Experience with the Charter  to date reflects a concern for a principle against self-incrimination which builds upon the discussion above.  A concern for that principle is evident in this Court's treatment of the enumerated protections in ss. 8 -14  of the Charter , and it can be seen to operate as a  


page 506

unifying principle in Hebert, supra, one which is capable of justifying residual rights.  I turn first to consider the enumerated protections in the order they appear.
     According to s. 10 (b) of the Charter , ""[e]veryone has the right on arrest or detention . . . to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right"".  In succinct terms, Lamer C.J. in Jones, supra, described how this Court's jurisprudence on s. 10 (b) implicitly recognizes a concern for self-incrimination.  Lamer C.J. stated (at pp. 254-55):
     Wilson J. wrote in Clarkson v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at p. 394, that the ""right (to counsel), as entrenched in s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , is clearly aimed at fostering the principles of adjudicative fairness"".  I then wrote in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 284, that ""one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial (is) the right against self-incrimination"".  The purpose of s. 10 (b), it can be concluded, is the fostering of the right against self-incrimination.  Or, as L'Heureux-Dubé J. said more directly in R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 539:
     The right to counsel is primarily aimed at preventing the accused or detained person from incriminating herself.  Thus the main concern would be with coerced or uninformed confessions.  In such circumstances, the accused would be manufacturing the evidence against herself.  This is something which, in the interests of fairness, the right to counsel would seek to protect.
     To this informative discussion, I can add nothing of consequence.
     According to s. 11 (c) of the Charter , ""[a]ny person charged with an offence has the right . . . not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence"".  This provision gives constitutional recognition to the rule of non-compellability which existed at common law, and which, as described above, was reaffirmed by Parliament in a 1906 amendment to The Canada Evidence Act, 1893.  It is not surprising,  


page 507

therefore, that this Court has recognized in Charter  terms the same policy justification for s. 11 (c) which, as I will discuss below, was advanced to account for the common-law rule.  In R. v. Amway Corp., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 21, this Court was asked whether a corporation could claim the protection of s. 11 (c).  In response, Sopinka J. stated (at p. 40):
     Applying a purposive interpretation to s. 11 (c), I am of the opinion that it was intended to protect the individual against the affront to dignity and privacy inherent in a practice which enables the prosecution to force the person charged to supply the evidence out of his or her own mouth.  Although disagreement exists as to the basis of the principle against self-incrimination, in my view, this factor plays a dominant role.
     Sopinka J. proceeded in Amway to cite with approval a passage which suggests that a corporation should not be regarded as a ""witness"" because the case-to-meet principle cannot benefit corporations in any meaningful way.  Corporations do not suffer affronts to individual dignity.
     According to s. 11 (d) of the Charter , ""[a]ny person charged with an offence has the right . . . to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal"".  In my view, both the presumption of innocence and the fair-hearing guarantees of s. 11 (d) are relevant to a principle against self-incrimination.  With respect to the presumption of innocence, Dickson C.J. stated in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 120:
     The presumption of innocence confirms our faith in humankind; it reflects our belief that individuals are decent and law-abiding members of the community until proven otherwise.
     What is this statement, if not an assertion of the case-to-meet principle?  The presumption of innocence operates to ensure that individuals are left in peace until the Crown establishes a prima facie case, and no sooner than that should a practical  


page 508

compulsion to testify arise:  P. (M.B.), supra, at p. 579.
     A not dissimilar kind of protection arises in respect of the duty of Crown disclosure.  In R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, Sopinka J. defined this duty, and related it to the accused's right to make full answer and defence, which right has attained constitutional importance under s. 7  of the Charter ; see also R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at p. 466.  However, inasmuch as this right is intimately associated with the fairness of trial proceedings themselves, it might also be considered under s. 11 (d), at least for present purposes.  In this regard, I note Sopinka J.'s statement in Stinchcombe which contrasts the Crown's duty to the obligations of the defence, in so far as ""the defence has no obligation to assist the prosecution and is entitled to assume a purely adversarial role toward the prosecution"" (p. 333).  The absence of any obligation to assist the Crown in the creation of a case, here recognized in the context of Crown disclosure, again complements the principle against self-incrimination.
     Section 13  of the Charter  falls next to be considered.  That provision provides that ""[a] witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence"".  Since s. 13 will be the subject of further comment below, it is sufficient at this stage to note that, regardless of what it protects or what the Charter  might additionally demand, s. 13  clearly responds to a self-incrimination concern.  In Dubois, supra, the leading case on s. 13  of the Charter , ss. 11 (c), 11 (d) and 13  were united by Lamer J. in the following passage (at p. 358):
     [T]he concept of the ""case to meet"" is common to ss. 11 (c), (d) and 13 .  In the context of ss. 11 (c) and 13 , it means specifically that the accused enjoys ""the initial  


page 509

benefit of a right of silence"" (R. v. Appleby, supra) and its corollary, protection against self-incrimination.  Section 13 , like s. 11 (c), is a recognition of the principle that,
     . . . the individual is sovereign and that proper rules of battle between government and individual require that the individual not be bothered for less than good reason and not be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself.
     (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), para. 2251, at p. 318.)
     Hence, the purpose of s. 13 , when the section is viewed in the context of s. 11 (c) and (d), is to protect individuals from being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves, to ensure that the Crown will not be able to do indirectly that which s. 11 (c) prohibits.  It guarantees the right not to have a person's previous testimony used to incriminate him or her in other proceedings.
     By preventing the subsequent use of a witness's compelled testimony, s. 13  offers the witness some protection against being forced to create a case to meet.
     In passing, I observe that these same ideas find expression beyond the specifically enumerated protections in ss. 8 -14  of the Charter .  With respect to s. 24(2)  of the Charter , Lamer C.J. observed in Jones, supra, at pp. 255-56:
     Evidence is generally inadmissible under s. 24(2)  if it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Evidence will tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute if it renders the trial process unfair.  Evidence renders the trial process unfair if it is obtained, after a violation of the Charter , by conscripting the accused against himself (that is, by using evidence that could not have been obtained but for the participation of the accused in the construction of the evidence); ""(t)he use of such evidence would render the trial unfair, for it did not exist prior to the violation and it strikes at one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial, the right against self-incrimination"" (Collins, at p. 284).


page 510


     It is not only logical, but also desirable, for the jurisprudence under s. 24(2)  to evolve with regard to a principle against self-incrimination.
     Finally, leaving aside the enumerated protections and s. 24(2)  of the Charter , I consider s. 7 , a provision which is especially instructive in respect of the principle against self-incrimination.  In Thomson Newspapers, supra, this Court held that s. 7  may contain residual protections capable of extending beyond ss. 11 (c) and 13 .  No agreement emerged in Thomson Newspapers regarding the availability or scope of such residual protections, but in Hebert, supra, a residual role for the provision was recognized.
     As already discussed, McLachlin J. in Hebert postulated a principle of fundamental justice which reflects concerns formerly embodied in the confessions rule and the common-law privilege against self-incrimination.  She stated that the principle involves ""the right of the individual to choose whether to make a statement to the authorities or to remain silent, coupled with concern with the repute and integrity of the judicial process"" (p. 175).  Given that I have associated the common-law protections underlying this principle from Hebert with the principle against self-incrimination, it is important to note that McLachlin J. in Hebert also linked the right to silence to ideas of self-incrimination.  She indicated that the measure of the right to silence may ""reside in the notion that a person whose liberty is placed in jeopardy by the criminal process cannot be required to give evidence against himself or herself"" (p. 175 (emphasis added)).

In my opinion, therefore, the residual protection developed in Hebert reflects the principle against self-incrimination or the concept of the case to meet.  Regarding this reflection, however, I would make the following point.  In Hebert, supra, this Court recognized a residual protection against self-incrimination, but that recognition was prompted in part by the need to protect the s. 11 (c) right  


page 511

against compellability.  McLachlin J. stated (at p. 174):
     From a practical point of view, the relationship between the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence at the investigatorial phase is equally clear.  The protection conferred by a legal system which grants the accused immunity from incriminating himself at trial but offers no protection with respect to pre-trial statements would be illusory.  [Emphasis added.]
     Hebert thus reflects the philosophy earlier expressed in Dubois, supra, that the Charter  should be ""construed as a system"" (p. 365; see also Hebert, supra, at p. 176).  But I would highlight that, in the enumerated provisions of the Charter , there exists ""no protection"" against self-incrimination applicable in respect of pre-trial statements to the police.  The guarantee of s. 11 (c) was regarded as potentially ""illusory"" in that context.  It does not follow that, in another context where the Charter  provides some protection, an analysis along Hebert lines should necessarily proceed.
     This point notwithstanding, I would conclude my review of Charter  protections against self-incrimination by highlighting the vigour of s. 7 .  Before the Charter , and, indeed, before Thomson Newspapers, it was generally believed that there was no functional principle against self-incrimination, but only a collection of specific rules which might be grouped beneath such a label:  see E. Ratushny, ""Self-Incrimination:  Nailing the Coffin Shut"" (1978), 20 Crim. L.Q. 312.  But it was also asserted, by Ratushny along with others (see Paciocco, supra, at p. 544), that a functional principle might be desirable.  In my opinion, Hebert removes all doubt not only as to the desirability, but also as to the existence, of a such a functional, unifying, principle.  If pre-trial silence was once nothing more than a particular manifestation of the general freedom to do as one pleases (see Ratushny, ""Is There a Right Against Self-Incrimination in Canada?"", supra; contra: Hebert, supra, at p. 198 (per Sopinka J.)), that is no longer the case.   


page 512

Pre-trial silence has been elevated to the status of a constitutional right.
     For these reasons, I conclude that a review of Charter  jurisprudence demonstrates not only that the pre-Charter  policy justification persists, but also that it has attained fresh constitutional nourishment.  The case-to-meet principle, first articulated in this country by  Ratushny (Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 179), has become a unifying thought.  There is a conceptual purity about this development, as M. Hor has noted in ""The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination and Fairness to the Accused"", [1993] Singapore J. Legal Stud. 35, at p. 35:
     Conceptually, it would seem that if there is any single organizing principle in the criminal process, it is the right of the accused to resist any effort to force him to assist in his own prosecution.  It provides substance to the common law ideal of a fair trial through an adversarial or accusatorial process.  The parties to a criminal prosecution are seen as competitors and the trial the competition.
     There is a principle against self-incrimination in Canada which is part of fundamental justice.  The task which remains is the task of determining what this principle demands in the context of this appeal.
     4.The Principle Against Self-Incrimination and Testimonial Compulsion
     (a)  Introduction:  Principles and Rules
     It is important to distinguish between rules and principles.  Section 7  of the Charter  directs an inquiry into the principles of fundamental justice.  I have identified one such principle, namely, the principle against self-incrimination.  It does not follow, however, that a particular rule which reflects that principle will reflect it in any particular way, or with any pre-defined scope.


page 513


     In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, Lamer J. commented upon the specific rights enumerated in ss. 8 -14  of the Charter  in the following terms (at p. 502):
     Sections 8  to 14  are illustrative of deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice.  For they, in effect, illustrate some of the parameters of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person; they are examples of instances in which the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person would be violated in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
     It is clear from this passage that the parameters of the right to liberty can be affected by the context in which the right is asserted.  In other words, I have suggested above that certain specific enumerations of the Charter  reflect a unifying principle against self-incrimination.  It stands only to reason, however, that this principle may demand different things at different times; the parameters of the principle may be found in disparate rights.
     I regard this point as important to the present appeal.  A failure to realize the distinction between principles and rights can promote two extreme kinds of error.  On the one hand, as I will discuss below, the assumption that one should give full effect to a principle might lead one to run roughshod over specific enumerations in the Charter .  This assumption fails to take account of context.  As Mewett has observed:  ""An individual's right means a legally protected interest, but the way in which that interest is protected differs in the case of different rights"" (""Law Enforcement and the Conflict of Values"", supra, at p. 181).
     On the other hand, an exclusive focus on rights would destroy the meaningful residual role for s. 7  which was recognized in Hebert, supra.  In speaking of lower court decisions which rejected such a role, Paciocco has stated (at p. 602):


page 514


     Suffice it to say, it is my view that the error of reasoning that these cases have fallen into is caused by a failure to distinguish rules from principles.  Granted, the only specific rules dealing exclusively and directly with self-incrimination in operation prior to the Charter  were subsumed by sections 11 (c) and 13 .  Yet, section 7 directs us to search for principles, not rules per se.  In particular, in this context, the question is whether there is a fundamental notion of justice related to self-incrimination which has influenced the development of, and supported the existence of, rules other than those enumerated in Marcoux.  [Emphasis in original.]
     At the same time, it is necessary to emphasize that the framers of the Charter  did not draft a free-standing right against self-incrimination.  Ratushny has suggested that the absence of such language is a laudable feature of the Charter , in that ""[i]t encourages attention to be focussed upon the specific procedural protections to which an accused is entitled without the distractions of emotive political battles of the past"":  Ratushny, ""The Role of the Accused in the Criminal Process"", in G.-. Beaudoin and E. Ratushny, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (2nd ed. 1989), 451, at p. 453.  The task, as I envision it, is to use existing rules to help one understand the limits upon a principle, while at the same time acknowledging that the principle has the capacity to introduce new rules to benefit the overall system.
     I proceed with these thoughts in mind to conduct the following examination.  First, I will note in cursory fashion how the self-incrimination principle reflects different rules in different contexts, such that it cannot be regarded as an absolute directive.  Second, I will consider whether the principle demands a rule to prohibit witness compellability on the facts of this appeal.  Third, after concluding that the Charter  condones testimonial compulsion on the facts, I will suggest that fundamental justice nonetheless demands that the witness have some protection beyond the limited protection provided by the language of s. 13 .


page 515


     (b)Limits on an Absolute Principle Against Self-Incrimination
     I regard as incontrovertible the fact that the principle against self-incrimination has not in the past, and does not now, find full and complete expression in Canadian law.  I have discussed in some detail above how statutory interference with the witness's privilege historically departed from the principle, particularly with respect to the perceived absence of derivative-use immunity under s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act .  But there are other limitations which should be noted as well.
     For example, even with regard to the common-law privilege against self-incrimination for witnesses itself, it cannot be said that the principle found full expression.  It was subject to at least two important limitations.  First, there was the problem that the privilege claimed by a witness could be rejected by the trial judge, leaving the witness entirely unprotected in the case of a wrongful rejection.  The trial judge's role appears in Re Westinghouse Electric Corp. Uranium Contract Litigation MDL Docket No. 235 (No. 2), [1977] 3 All E.R. 717 (C.A.), at p. 721:
     The common law . . . says:  ""If a witness claims the protection of the court, on the ground that the answer would tend to incriminate himself and there appears reasonable ground to believe that it would do so, he is not compellable to answer:"" . . . It is for the judge to say whether there is reasonable ground or not. [Emphasis added.]
     Such a witness must confront unprotected what Wigmore called the ""three horns of the triceratops -- harmful disclosure, contempt, perjury"" ([sect  ]2251, at p. 316 (emphasis in original)).  To a similar effect was the problem of the adverse inference which might be drawn from a witness's decision to claim the privilege.  It has been said that an ""adverse inference for refusal to answer while in the witness box was eminently available"":  J. Watson, ""Talking About the Right to Remain Silent""  


page 516

(1991), 34 Crim. L.Q. 106, at p. 117.  See generally, Paciocco, supra, at p. 449.
     In post-Charter  terms, other limitations on the principle against self-incrimination are also visible.  The right to silence recognized by Hebert, supra, is not a free-floating right always available, but rather a right which has so far been linked to the concept of detention, and, moreover, it is not a right which is absolute and ""capable of being discharged only by waiver"" (p. 183).  Similarly, the discussion in Stinchcombe, supra, which suggests that the defence has no obligation to assist the Crown, must be qualified in certain respects.  In P. (M.B.), supra, Lamer C.J. stated (at p. 578):
     However, it should be borne in mind that this protection against disclosure is not an absolute one.  For example, failure to disclose an alibi defence in a timely manner may affect the weight given to the defence:  E. G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada (2nd ed. 1987), at para. 16:8070; McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence, supra, at paras. 28:10711-10712.
     To a similar effect, the relationship between the case-to-meet principle and the presumption of innocence is altered, if not destroyed, by constitutionally permissible reverse-onus provisions.  On a number of occasions, this Court has found that a provision which violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter  may nonetheless constitute a reasonable limit, demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society:  R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3; R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697; R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303; R. v. Romeo, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86; R. v. Ratti, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 68; and R. v. Downey, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 10.  By definition, a provision which relieves the Crown of some burden which would otherwise exist, and which places upon the accused a burden of adducing evidence, obfuscates the case-to-meet principle:  see Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 179.  And yet, in certain circumstances, we have held that the thing must be done.


page 517


     Finally, before turning my attention to ss. 7  and 13  of the Charter , I call attention to an inherent but often overlooked limitation on the principle against self-incrimination as recognized by s. 11 (c) of the Charter .  Section 11 (c) constitutionalizes the accused's common-law right of noncompellability, but it is not insignificant that the accused who testifies is subject to cross-examination.  Although it might be suggested that the accused will not testify until the Crown has produced a case to meet, this is no guarantee that the accused's cross-examination will not serve to incriminate further the accused.  Ratushny recognized this point in the pre-Charter  context with respect to the Canada Evidence Act :
     An important feature of the approach [of the Canada Evidence Act  which renders an accused competent but not compellable] was that, if he decided to take the stand on his own behalf, he could also be required to testify against himself.  No attempt was made in the Act to protect him against cross-examination which might incriminate him at the trial at which he testified.
     (""Is There a Right Against Self-Incrimination in Canada?"", supra, at p. 31.)
     If the principle against self-incrimination were to be given full sway, we might permit the accused to testify for the purpose of offering a defence, but then prohibit the Crown from bolstering its case with evidence out of the accused's own mouth.
     These cursory observations are sufficient, in my opinion, to demonstrate that the principle against self-incrimination may mean different things at different times and in different contexts.  The principle admits of many rules.  What should the rule be in respect of testimonial compulsion?
     (c)The Principle Against Self-Incrimination and WitnessCompellability
     I begin this inquiry by asserting that any rule demanded by the principle against self-incrimination which places a limit on compellability is in dynamic tension with an opposing principle of fundamental justice.  That is the principle which  


page 518

suggests that, in a search for truth, relevant evidence should be available to the trier of fact.  Wigmore, supra, expressed the point well ([sect  ]2192, at p. 70):
     For more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public (in the words sanctioned by Lord Hardwicke) has a right to every man's evidence.  When we come to examine the various claims of exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule. . . .
     Obviously, the Charter  sanctions deviations from this positive general rule.  Sections 11 (c) and 13  stand as obvious examples.  The question is whether we need another exemption, and if so, why?
     The difficulty of this question is evidenced by the fact that it has prompted academics to adopt points of polar opposition.  Ratushny and Mewett have both expressed the view that protection of the self-incrimination principle demands, in essence, a return to the common-law position, such that a witness should have the right to object to questions which tend to incriminate:  Ratushny, Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at pp. 393 et seq.; Mewett, ""Law Enforcement and the Conflict of Values"", supra, at pp. 198-99; and Mewett, ""The Right to Silence"", supra, at p. 274.  Aligned with this view is the proposition that testimony which is nonetheless desired by authorities should be available, provided that immunity protection is provided.  Ratushny states:
     The precise scope of a unified right against self-incrimination will have to be fashioned carefully.  However, at a minimum it should permit a potential witness to refuse to provide testimony which would be personally incriminating in the absence of a specific and binding grant of immunity from prosecution in relation to the subject-matter of such testimony.
     (""The Role of the Accused in the Criminal Process"", supra, at p. 487.)


page 519


     The immunity protection envisioned by this passage is apparently the ""transactional immunity"" recognized historically in the United States by Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547 (1892).  The suggestion is that nothing short of formal prosecutorial immunity can justify the forced production of a self-incriminatory answer.
     I point out that the position of the appellant in this case amounts to an extension of this first view.  That is, in the absence of guaranteed transactional immunity, the appellant would claim not just a right equivalent to the common-law privilege against self-incrimination, but rather he would claim a complete right to silence.  The claim amounts to an extension of the reasoning in Hebert, supra, such that the appellant argues ""[t]here is no logical distinction between the accused person being questioned pursuant to a subpoena under oath at his co-accused's trial or pursuant to arrest or detention at the station-house"".
     Then there is the second polar view.  According to Paciocco, supra, there is a fundamental distinction between testimonial self-incrimination, meaning the use of a person's communications ""as evidence of the truth of their contents to assist the Crown in proving the commission of a criminal offence by that person"" (p. 540), and non-testimonial self-incrimination.  According to Paciocco, when a person's communication is merely a source of information, such that the accused person is not directly engaged in the creation of self-incriminatory evidence, a different analysis is appropriate.  In Paciocco's view, the only residual protection against self-incrimination required under s. 7  of the Charter  is the kind of protection already recognized by Hebert, that is, protection against self-incriminatory pre-trial statements to police (at p. 597):
     The principle does not take offence at compelled disclosure.  The relevant principle, I suggest, is that forcing the accused to respond to an allegation at the proceedings   


page 520

where he is being tried and where his liberty is imperilled violates the principle of a case to meet because it compels the accused to answer.  Using the accused's pretrial compelled statements would subvert that principle by using an enforced answer as part of the Crown's case just as if the answer had been compelled at the trial itself.  Using evidence discovered as a result of a pretrial compelled statement is not the admission of an enforced answer and is not, therefore, an enforced response at the trial which has been required prior to the establishment by the Crown of a case to meet.  Evidence discovered by compelled ""clue facts"" is not therefore protected.  [Emphasis in original.]
     Likewise, in respect of compelled testimony in parallel proceedings, Paciocco suggests that the relevant principle demands only what s. 13  provides, namely, protection against the subsequent use of compelled testimony.  To state the matter another way, Paciocco would not demand derivative-evidence protection, whether in the form of a clue-fact privilege or a derivative-use immunity, for the purposes of s. 7 .
     To resolve this disagreement, I am of the opinion that one must have primary regard for the structure and language of the Charter .  In Thomson Newspapers, supra, this sentiment tended to ignite a debate regarding the propriety of interpreting the Charter  using the expressio unius principle of statutory construction.  That is, there was a current of resistance, most evident in the reasons of Wilson J., against the suggestion that the mere presence of ss. 11 (c) and 13  is determinative of the question whether additional self-incrimination protections are possible.  I agree with Wilson J. that a mechanical application of an expressio unius principle would be ""inconsistent with the purposive approach to Charter  interpretation"" (p. 470).  Indeed, taken to an extreme, such mechanics might have precluded the result in Hebert.  But it does not follow that the presence of the enumerated protections can be ignored.  L'Heureux-Dubé J. reflected this sentiment in Thomson Newspapers when she stated that ""once the values have been identified, these rules [of statutory interpretation] might still  


page 521

be available in later stages of the analysis"" (p. 570).  That is another way of saying that, in a particular case, the result which might have been demanded by the expressio unius rule turns out to be the same result which is demanded by a purposive approach.
     The enumerated protections in the Charter  are of particular importance when one considers the broader context of our legal system.  The relevance of this context to an inquiry under s. 7  is beyond dispute:  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at p. 503.  Moreover, it is clear that the investigation can target not only the common-law or constitutional context, but also the legislative context.  It is relevant to consider the principles which ""have animated legislative and judicial practice in Canada"":  R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 327; see also R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387; and R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.
     So, I simply make a point which has been made before:  it is difficult, if not impossible, to ignore the similarity between the structure of ss. 11 (c) and 13  of the Charter , and the statutory approach apparent in s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .  The two structures share a concern for the non-compellability of accused persons, and both seek to protect witnesses against self-incrimination by providing a form of use immunity.  They principally differ in that s. 13  of the Charter  omits that much criticized portion of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  which requires a witness to claim its protection:  see Dubois, supra, at p. 360.
     Thus, there are two aspects of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  which one might suppose have been constitutionalized in s. 13  of the Charter :  first, a general rule of compellability for witnesses; second, a general rule that witnesses will be protected against self-incrimination through immunity protection rather than a privilege.  The first polar view described above takes issue with  


page 522

the propriety of these general rules, or at least seeks to qualify them.
     With respect, then, to the proposition that there should be a right to silence which can be claimed by some, if perhaps not all, witnesses, the challenge is directed toward the general rule of compellability.  In fairness, even the appellant, as I understand his position, would not go so far as to suggest all witnesses should have a right to stand mute.  Or, at least, I have not been made aware of any common-law, statutory, or constitutional authority which has gone so far.  With regard to the common law in particular, there was protection by way of non-compellability for accused persons, and protection by way of privilege for witnesses.  But once the testimony of witnesses became admissible in court as an historical matter, witnesses were never, thereafter, protected by a non-compellability rule.
     Should this point require emphasis, I consider it instructive to compare the current text of s. 13  to an earlier version.  As proclaimed, s. 13  provides protection to ""[a] witness who testifies"".  In the Proposed Constitutional Resolution of October, 1980, however, the s. 13  right was to be afforded to ""[a] witness . . . when compelled to testify"":  The Canadian Constitution 1980:  Proposed Resolution respecting the Constitution of Canada (1980), at p. 18.  In Dubois, supra, Lamer J. indicated that s. 13 's legislative history demonstrates that it is intended to protect the voluntary witness (p. 360);  see also R. v. Staranchuk (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 138 (Sask. Q.B.), rev'd on other ground (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 150 (Sask. C.A.).  But surely that is all this legislative history demonstrates.  In other words, by removing the reference to compellability in s. 13  of the Charter , the drafters presumably meant to extend its protection to witnesses other than witnesses who testify on compulsion.  The absence of compellability language cannot have been meant to cast doubt upon the general rule that witnesses are compellable.  To permit such doubt  


page 523

would be to cast aside the state's usual right to demand evidence in the search for truth.
     This suggests that compellability is a general rule, but it is germane to reiterate that the appellant only claims an exemption from this general rule.  The exemption he proposes is status based.  The appellant's primary contention is that ""an individual charged with a criminal offence has a fundamental right to remain mute and not answer questions regarding their potential liability"".  As already mentioned, this contention amounts to an extension of the reasoning from Hebert, supra, where a right to silence was recognized for persons who have been detained.  The contention requires careful consideration.
     In Hebert, this Court developed a right to silence so that ""[t]he suspect, although placed in the superior power of the state upon detention, retains the right to choose whether or not he will make a statement to the police"" (p. 180).  This was done on the theory that (at p. 181):
     In keeping with the approach inaugurated by the Charter , our courts must adopt an approach to pre-trial interrogation which emphasizes the right of the detained person to make a meaningful choice and permits the rejection of statements which have been obtained unfairly in circumstances that violate that right of choice.
     In the pre-trial interrogation context, a fundamental concern arises as to the omnipotence of the state, and we seek to avoid ""abuses of power against the individual"" (p. 183).
     The pre-trial interrogation context of Hebert must be highlighted.  In that context, the self-incrimination principle is affected in more than one way.  It is not simply the effect of a pre-trial disclosure which endangers the principle, but also the purpose of the activity itself.  One's status as ""detained person"" is relevant because it defines  


page 524

when pre-trial interrogation begins.  In this regard, McLachlin J. in Hebert distinguished between pre-trial interrogation, and pre-detention investigations (at p. 184):
     Nor does the Charter  extend the right to counsel to pre-detention investigations.  The two circumstances are quite different.  In an undercover operation prior to detention, the individual from whom information is sought is not in the control of the state.  There is no need to protect him from the greater power of the state.  After detention, the situation is quite different; the state takes control and assumes the responsibility of ensuring that the detainee's rights are respected.
     Once detention arises, the state's power over the individual is such that a statement obtained in violation of the right to remain silent is self-conscriptive.  But note that the agent who ignores the Charter  right acts for the purpose of building a case against the accused.  In the same way that s. 11 (c) ensures that the accused will not have to participate in this purpose at trial, s. 7  acts to protect the accused prior to trial.
     A very significant problem arises, however, when one attempts to transport Hebert uncritically to a context involving testimonial compulsion in established proceedings.  In such a context, the accused person (or, one might just as easily say ""the detained person"", or ""the suspect"") would like to argue that, although the proceedings are not instituted for the purpose of obtaining self-conscriptive evidence, the proceedings will nonetheless have that effect.  Based upon this logic, the accused demands special constitutional protection at such parallel proceedings.
     To my mind, there is an inherent and serious flaw in this argument.  Of course, it is well established that either an unconstitutional purpose or an unconstitutional effect can invalidate a provision, and so I take no issue with the appellant's effort to highlight an unconstitutional effect:  R. v. Big M  


page 525

 Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295.  The problem, however, is that the self-conscriptive effect identified by the appellant is precisely the same effect which confronts every witness who is compellable and who must answer questions pursuant to s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .  The accused person, the detainee, the suspect, the compelled or voluntary witness for the prosecution, and the compelled or voluntary witness for the defence, all confront an identical hazard.  Once it is determined that a proceeding lacks the flavour of pre-trial interrogation, the fact of status devolves into meaninglessness.  Detention becomes indicative of purpose; detention has nothing exclusive to say about effects.
     The most important authority which might be advanced to support a contrary view, namely, Batary v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan, [1965] S.C.R. 465, has enjoyed a history of mutilation which effectively makes my point.  I will consider that decision immediately below.  Before I do so, however, I wish to emphasize that, irrespective of whether one considers Batary to be correctly or incorrectly decided, and irrespective of whether one believes that, in post-Charter  terms, Batary reflects a worthwhile principle, Batary is only meaningful at this stage of the inquiry if it supports a rule against self-incrimination which is based upon the status of the person whose evidence is sought to be compelled.
     In Batary, a provincial coroner's inquest had the power to compel testimony from any person:  The Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, s. 15 (as am. by S.S. 1960, c. 14, s. 3).  Cartwright J. for the majority first examined the English history of the coroner's inquest, and concluded that the received law of Saskatchewan included the English criminal-law proposition that ""a person charged with murder and awaiting trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest into the death of the deceased with whose murder he was charged"" (p. 475).  In the opinion of Cartwright J., this rule of non-compellability was not altered by any intervening  


page 526

federal enactment in this country.  With respect to the provincial provision, he then reasoned (at p. 478):
     Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare which has been described (by Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott) as ""a maxim of our law as settled, as important and as wise as almost any other in it.""
     Cartwright J. concluded that the Saskatchewan compellability provision was ultra vires legislation enacted in relation to the criminal law including the procedure in criminal matters:  Constitution Act, 1867 , s. 91(27) .  A rule of law, applicable to accused persons, was thus perceived to be born:  W. Henkel, ""Competency, Compellability and Coroners' Courts"" (1970), 12 Crim. L.Q. 166.
     My difficulty, however, lies in making the association Cartwright J. made between the nemo tenetur maxim -- which I have here reformulated into the principle against self-incrimination -- and a rule against compellability which derives from a witness's status as accused person in other proceedings.  In particular, if the principle against self-incrimination abhors the notion that an accused person can be compelled in separate proceedings, one wonders how Batary can be rationalized in the pre-Charter  context with the proposition, not then disputed, that accused persons either jointly or separately indicted, but separately tried on a charge, were compellable at each other's trials.  This point appears, for example, in Re Regan, [1939] 2 D.L.R. 135 (N.S.C.A.),  cited by both the majority and dissent in Batary, supra.
     Moreover, if the principle against self-incrimination would take issue with the compellability of a person accused of an offence, would it not also take issue with the compellability of a suspect?  It is difficult to believe that a principle as supposedly  


page 527

fundamental as the principle against self-incrimination would be susceptible to easy manipulation through the timing of a formal charge.  As Estey J. noted in Attorney General of Quebec and Keable v. Attorney General of Canada, supra, the circumstances which control the timing of an indictment may be ""accidental or at least undirected"" (p. 256).  Moreover, as Ratushny has noted, defence counsel operating under such a rule of law might have been well advised to ""lay[] an information against his own client!"" (Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 362).
     And, in any event, in the next relevant case after Batary, supra, namely, Faber v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 9, this Court confined Batary to its facts in this regard.  According to de Grandpré J., a witness compelled to testify before a coroner's inquest in Quebec could not complain because (at pp. 21-22):
     In the case at bar appellant, at the time he was required to testify, had not been charged with any offence as a result of the death of Csoman, and as a matter of fact no charge has been brought against him to date.  In my view the effect of this fundamental difference is that Batary has no application to the case at bar.
     There is no doubt that in distinguishing Batary in this fashion, this Court rejected an analogy between persons charged with an offence and mere suspects, that is, persons likely to be charged with an offence:  see Di Iorio, supra, at pp. 216-17.
     Given the obvious contradictions between Batary on the one hand, and cases like Regan, supra, Faber, supra, and Di Iorio, supra, on the other, it cannot be seriously contended that there has been any coherent recognition of a non-compellability rule which attaches to the status of a person without regard for the character of the proceedings in which testimony is sought to be compelled.  It may be that Batary simply reflects an anomalous rule from history.  Or, it may be that there is considerable doubt as to the correctness of  


page 528

Cartwright J.'s summary of English law in Batary, supra.  In this regard, I note the following criticisms advanced by Ratushny:
     On the historical aspect of the judgment, it is perhaps significant that no authority was cited indicating that the accused could not be called as a witness at an inquest.  Rather, the negative approach was taken, that no case had been cited in which that had happened.  But if the person's status as an accused is irrelevant, there would be no reason to mention it.
     Perhaps what is more important in this context, is the state of the law with respect to witnesses historically.  It will be recalled that at common law, a witness did not merely have protection against his testimony being used at a future proceeding.  He could refuse to answer.  In these circumstances, there would be little point in calling an accused, or even a suspect, as a witness.  It is submitted that this is the true significance of the passage quoted by Cartwright J. from Jervis on Coroners, to the effect that an order to compel a person to attend before a coroner and jury:
     . . . will generally be made if the prisoner is not the party under accusation; or, if he is accused or suspected, then when he is desirous of making a statement, and perhaps also when his presence is requisite for the purpose of identification.
     The passage recognizes that an accused can be compelled, but also recognizes the futility of calling him, unless there is an indication that he will waive his right to refuse to answer.  [Emphasis in original.]
     (""Is There a Right Against Self-Incrimination in Canada"", supra, at p. 58.)
     Like Ratushny, I am concerned that this Court in Batary fundamentally confused two kinds of authorities:  first, authorities which recognized the practical futility of calling an accused to testify in parallel proceedings about the subject matter of a charge, in recognition of the common-law testimonial privilege; and, second, possibly non-existent authorities which might establish a rule of law to the effect that persons with a certain status are not compellable in parallel proceedings.  Especially instructive in this regard is Cartwright J.'s citation of R. v. Scorey (1748), 1 Leach 43, 168 E.R. 124,  


page 529

and Wakley v. Cooke (1849), 4 Ex. 511, 154 E.R. 1316, and his statement that (at p. 474):
     There is nothing in the judgments in either of these cases to suggest that a person charged with the murder of a person into whose death an inquest was being held could be compelled to testify at such inquest.

With respect, I must disagree.  In Wakley, supra, Pollock C.B. impugned the practice of the Middlesex coroners which led those coroners to refuse testimony from accused persons and suspects, and he did so in clear terms (at p. 1318 E.R.):
     Such a practice, no doubt, is not correct, and it is to be hoped that it will be discontinued hereafter.  It is manifestly contrary to the law of the land; and it is quite clear that the evidence of a man ought never to be excluded in an investigation before a coroner, on the ground that he may criminate himself, for it is not right to assume that he is guilty; and the witness may guard his own interests in giving his evidence.  [Emphasis added.]
     In other words, the authorities relied upon by Cartwright J. in Batary to support the proposition that accused persons were not compellable by coroners in England go some distance toward proving the opposite point, namely, that the compellability of persons was defined not by their status in parallel proceedings, but rather by their status in the proceedings where testimony was desired.
     Having made these points, I will go no further toward impugning the result in Batary, and I am not of a mind to overrule it.  On its facts, it is noteworthy that an accused's preliminary inquiry in Batary was adjourned at the instance of an Attorney General so that a coroner's inquest into the very same matter might be conducted, and so that the accused might be therefore compelled to testify.  Cartwright J.'s policy objection to this state of affairs has no little significance in relation to a principle against self-incrimination.  He stated (at p. 476):


page 530


     It would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt.  In the absence of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority I am unable to agree that that is the state of the law.
     It must be noted, of course, that Cartwright J. in this passage acknowledged the pre-Charter  supremacy of Parliament in respect, even, of such ""a strange inconsistency"" as he perceived, and he did not have available to him any free-floating principle against self-incrimination which he might have used to combat it.  But, since he was confronted with provincial legislation, he could command a division-of-powers analysis, and he may have used that analysis to ""incorporate into the federalism issue a partial `protection of rights' analysis"":  Ontario Law Reform Commission, Report on Public Inquiries (1992), at p. 73.
     Whether or not the Charter  might respond to the policy objection voiced in Batary is not, however, the issue confronting me now.  As indicated above, the problem which Batary does not resolve is this:  there is no logical reason to distinguish for s. 7  purposes between persons on the basis of a status defined in parallel proceedings, in so far as a testimonial compulsion in other proceedings is concerned.  If a statutory compulsion, as applied to two individuals, will result in each divulging the same information on the stand, and if that information is similarly inculpatory for each, why should the two receive different kinds of Charter  protection?  In my opinion, they should not.
     If one accepts this proposition, then the available options become easier to manage.  It becomes clear, for example, that if the principle against self-incrimination, as it is applied to an accused person or a suspect at parallel proceedings, can be satisfied by nothing less than a right to silence, then  


page 531

that right to silence must be available to all persons, since the question of status is irrelevant.  I have already suggested above that this deafening silence finds no support anywhere, and it ought to be rejected.
     What about a return to the common-law position?  I have noted that both Ratushny and Mewett favour this view.  Ratushny, for his part, has discussed how a modified form of the rule from Batary, supra, might be developed, such that a person charged with an offence would have the common-law privilege against self-incrimination.  But, as I have noted above, Ratushny recognized that by logical extension the common-law testimonial privilege for witnesses would result:
     If such a protection is to be restored to persons who have already been charged, is there any logical reason for not extending it to persons who are likely to be charged or who could be charged?  Without such an extension, the Crown could simply postpone the laying of charges until the suspect had completed his testimony at the other hearing.  This appears to have been the situation, for example, in the Johansen case.
     If the proposed provision were to be extended to persons who are not yet charged, we would be back, essentially, to the common law position.  A witness would be permitted to refuse to answer any question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate him of a criminal offence.  [Emphasis in original.]
     (Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at pp. 393-94.)
     It is in respect of this argument, that is, the argument that we should retreat to the common-law position, that I consider it doubly important to have primary regard for the structure of the Charter .  I agree, for the reasons variously expressed in Thomson Newspapers, supra, that we must take care to guard against defining the principles of fundamental justice in overreliance upon a legislative position, even a position of long standing.  However, to contend that s. 7 of the Charter demands a testimonial privilege for all witnesses is  


page 532

to suggest that the framers of our Constitution misunderstood the nature of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  and simply forgot to include a provision in the Charter  comparable to the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is a proposition which I cannot accept.
     Indeed, it is clear that Canada repeatedly resolved to maintain a position whereby witnesses are able to claim a protective mechanism which admits of certain application and which has a defined reach.  While the longevity of the Canada Evidence Act  approach is perhaps not a determinative consideration, its longevity has particular significance when one considers that the Canadian position has been the subject of unending scrutiny which it has always survived.  The considered opinion of the legal community in this country has repeatedly advocated its retention:  see, e.g.,  Law Reform Commission of Canada, Working Paper 17, Commissions of Inquiry:  A New Act (1977), at pp. 36-37; and Report of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence, supra, at pp. 438-39.  Even the Canadian Committee on Corrections, quoted above as suggesting that an absence of derivative-use immunity bestows a ""powerful weapon"" upon Canadian law enforcement, did not advocate a return to the common-law position.  Instead, in the pre-Charter  context, the only change repeatedly recommended is the one s. 13  of the Charter  obviously embodies, namely, the abolition of the requirement for witnesses to claim immunity protection.
     In short, the structure of the Charter demonstrates an obvious attempt to enact in constitutional form the same structural protection against self-incrimination for witnesses which existed historically.  The protection envisioned involves a general rule of witness compellability, coupled with an evidentiary immunity.  Even Ratushny, who argues for new protection, admits that the Charter 's structure was intended to reproduce the pre-existing approach:  ""The Role of the Accused in the  


page 533

Criminal Process"", supra, at p. 486; see also Paciocco, supra, at pp. 445-46.  I am driven to agree with the sentiment ably expressed in Re Transpacific Tours Ltd. and Director of Investigation & Research (1985), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 103 (B.C.S.C.), by Lysyk J. (at pp. 121-22):
     The Charter 's draftsmen would have been mindful . . . of the fact that the broad common-law privilege against self-incrimination had effectively been set aside in Canada decades ago by the predecessor provisions of what is now s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . . . .
     . . .
     The form of limited protection against self-incrimination afforded by those enactments is deeply ingrained in the Canadian justice system.  Had the framers of the Charter  wished to revert to the position at common law . . . it is difficult to understand why they would have elected to achieve this objective in such oblique fashion -- through the general language of s. 7  -- instead of addressing the matter directly in s. 13  itself.
     Like La Forest J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, I must infer that the American model, ""complete with all its residual doctrines"" (p. 538), was specifically considered and rejected.  See also Haywood Securities Inc. v. Inter-Tech Resource Group Inc. (1985), 24 D.L.R. (4th) 724 (B.C.C.A.).

To pause for a moment, I distinguish this analysis from the analysis in Hebert, supra.  In that case, a residual role for s. 7  was recognized which operated to protect s. 11 (d), and which gave effect to the Charter  as a coherent system.  To use s. 7  for the purposes here suggested, namely, as the repository for an absolute right to silence or for the common-law witness privilege, would do violence to that system.  It would become difficult to account for the existence of s. 13 .  This is not expressio unius construction.  This is an effort to respect an obvious intention.
     Indeed, by rejecting the polar positions associated with the right to silence and the privilege  


page 534

against self-incrimination, I admit that Canada has adopted a particular attitude with respect to the principle against self-incrimination as that principle is applied to witnesses.  Once testimony is compelled, no form of evidentiary immunity can hope to restore completely the principle's lustre.  Even if use immunity together with a broadly conceived derivative-use immunity were made available, there would still be the problem that a witness's testimony might make the authorities commence an independent investigation.   The police might become alive to a crime only because of a witness's testimony.  Nothing short of transactional immunity could solve this problem.
     Thus, as soon as one accepts that the Canadian solution is to couple compellability with protection in the form of evidentiary immunity, one is left to conclude that Canada is willing to permit a unique balancing of individual and societal interests.  As recognized in Seaboyer, supra, ""[t]he principles of fundamental justice reflect a spectrum of interests, from the rights of the accused to broader societal concerns"" (p. 603).  I agree with the following statement by La Forest J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 541:
     A right to prevent the subsequent use of compelled self-incriminating testimony protects the individual from being ""conscripted against himself"" without simultaneously denying an investigator's access to relevant information.  It strikes a just and proper balance between the interests of the individual and the state.
     With respect to the suggestion that the Charter  would condone a return to the common-law privilege, Mewett has stated:  ""The major disadvantage is that such a privilege tends to protect not only the individual claiming it but any others whose present or future conviction may depend upon the securing of his testimony"" (""The Right to Silence"", supra, at p. 274).  In my opinion, the structure of the  


page 535

Charter  rejects this disadvantage as an unacceptable balance between individual and societal needs.  It compels the conclusion that immunity protection is the Canadian method of preserving the principle against self-incrimination in the context of a general rule of witness compellability.  As I suggested above, it is not unreasonable for the principle to demand silence in one context, and to respond with immunity in another.  The extent of the necessary immunity is a problem which I will return to below.
     Before doing so, however, I must acknowledge the Achilles heel of the approach evident in the Charter .  I have suggested above that the principle of the case to meet, or the principle against self-incrimination, is a unifying principle of criminal law which finds recognition in the Charter .  I have also explained why it is fallacious to suppose that Charter  protections should vary with individual status.  But having rejected status as a means to control the compellability of individuals, the Charter  is left on a precipice.  For if it be accepted that a person can always be compelled as a witness and that protection by way of evidentiary immunity will always be sufficient, then it must also be accepted that we have gone considerable distance toward diluting the principle of the case to meet without ever having said so.
     In identifying the problem we face, I can do no better than quote from Ratushny once more:
     The basic problem is that many of the protections provided by the criminal process may be subverted by calling the suspect or accused as a witness at some other proceeding prior to his criminal trial.
     It is true that such a witness may prevent his testimony from being introduced at any subsequent criminal trial.  However, the damage may be done in other ways.  The earlier hearing might be used as a `fishing expedition' to subject the witness to extensive questioning with a view to uncovering possible criminal conduct.  The questioning might also be used to investigate a particular offence.  For example, the accused might be  


page 536

required to reveal possible defences, the names of potential defence witnesses and other evidence.  Moreover, the publicity generated by the hearing may seriously prejudice the likelihood of a fair trial.
     The problem is that the initial hearing is likely to have none of the protections guaranteed by the criminal process.  There will be no specific accusation, no presumption of innocence, no protections against prejudicial publicity, no rules of evidence and so on.  It is submitted that there is a serious crisis of integrity in a criminal process whose detailed protections may so easily be ignored.  Nor are these merely theoretical problems.
     (""The Role of the Accused in the Criminal Process"", supra, at pp. 483-84.)
     To put the matter another way, the Charter 's structure as described above is founded upon the Crown's obligation to make a case, but it also assumes a general rule of compellability coupled with evidentiary immunity.  If, however, the Charter  places no limits on when this structure may be invoked, then the Charter  could, in fact, condone an inquisition of the most notorious kind.  Such condonation would bespeak an impossible dualism.  To ask a question by paraphrasing a concern voiced in Thomson Newspapers, supra, at p. 606 (per Sopinka J.):  are we prepared to arm the police with subpoena powers?
     I do not think that we are, but the difficulty lies in fashioning an acceptable response.  Because the status of individuals cannot be manipulated in any meaningful way to confine the reach of a general compellability rule, one is left with the difficult task of focusing on the character of proceedings at which testimony is sought to be compelled.  This is a task which I do not relish, but it seems absolutely demanded by the structure of the Charter .
     Like La Forest J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, therefore, I begin by borrowing from  


page 537

Ratushny the distinction between proceedings which are adversarial and those which are inquisitorial.  Ratushny introduced this distinction in these terms:
     This whole ""adversary"" approach can be contrasted with an ""inquisitorial"" approach, where the emphasis shifts from an accusation to the terms of reference of the inquiry.  For example, instead of an accusation that X is criminally responsible for the murder of Y, the inquiry might be into the circumstances surrounding the cause of Y's death.  The inquiry might even be to determine specifically whether or not X is criminally responsible for the death of Y.  However, an inquiry suggests an initiative on the part of the adjudicator.  The passive judicial role is no longer possible.  The adjudicator becomes an investigator as well as a judge.

In these circumstances, the crucial burden on the Crown to prove its accusation no longer exists.
     (Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 21.)
     Regardless of the character of proceedings in which a witness's testimony is sought to be compelled, if those proceedings are not adversarial vis-à-vis the witness, then the proceedings naturally operate in inquisitorial terms in relation to that witness.  This is so even if the proceedings take place in the criminal realm and involve an adversarial contest between the state and another accused person.
     The troubling question is this:  when should an inquiry of this sort be condoned?  It is unavoidably the case that an answer to this question can be found only if one examines the purpose for which testimony is desired by the state.  I have already suggested that an emphasis on the self-incriminatory effects of an inquiry would ride roughshod over the specific enumerations of the Charter .  A focus on purpose, however, holds more promise.  It is to be recalled that, like Wilson J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, I have characterized the principle against self-incrimination as being subject to the proposition that ""[t]he state must have some justification for interfering with the individual"" (p. 480).  An essential objection must be lodged  


page 538

against a proceeding which is justified by a self-incriminatory purpose.  But there are many other purposes in our complex society.
     In this regard, I note that a focus on the purpose, or character, of proceedings, dominated the analysis of the Law Reform Commission of Canada in its Working Paper 17, Commissions of Inquiry:  A New Act, supra.  Although the Commission dealt in that paper only with the problem of the inquisitorial mode of questioning altogether apart from the adversarial realm of criminal law which concerns me here, the Commission fashioned a model which I find instructive.  In particular, the Commission distinguished between investigatory inquiries on the one hand, and advisory inquiries on the other (a distinction later embodied in its Report 13,  Advisory and Investigatory Commissions (1979)).  The latter kind of inquiry, according to the Commission, ""might consider any policy matter of substantial importance, or complex problem requiring expert solution"" (Working Paper 17, at p. 26).  Accordingly, such an inquiry might properly have broad powers and be permitted to range freely.  But, notably, the Commission regarded the breadth of an advisory inquiry's purpose as an anathema to testimonial compulsion (at p. 28).
     An investigatory inquiry, on the other hand, was characterized by the Commission as being an inquiry directed toward a target which limits its scope, and which defines its social importance.  An inquiry of this kind might legitimately possess the power to compel witnesses on the theory that it acts in furtherance of a goal which has substantial public importance.  On this point, the Commission stated:
     What is of ""substantial public importance""?  A new statute should not list categories of such matters; legislative life being what it is, inevitably such a list would quickly prove incomplete and obstructive.  In most instances, however, whether a given matter is of such a kind should be evident.  Does it involve, for example, serious accusations of incompetence or venality in government itself?  Serious breakdown in the  


page 539

implementation or administration of an established government policy?  Natural disaster badly handled or an unexplained serious accident?  It is fair to say that, although one cannot anticipate all questions that can reasonably be deemed to be of substantial public importance, ""one will know one when one sees one"".
     (Working Paper 17, at p. 31.)
     Although the last-mentioned point might be taken to suggest that only a ""smell test"" is capable of distinguishing between investigatory and advisory inquiries, I am inclined to think that a more manageable structure can be devised.  I note, for example, the Commission's additional suggestion that the two kinds of inquiry may be attracted to different kinds of facts, in so far as the investigatory inquiry ""may well be interested in questions of fault and blame"" (p. 25).  In any event, it is apparent that the line cannot be a hard and fast one, since an analysis of purpose does not exclude incidental effects.
     In positing this distinction between inquiries which might be permitted to compel testimony and those which might not, I am mindful of the fact that the advisory/investigatory distinction has been criticized.  In particular, it has been suggested that this distinction mirrors the false dichotomy between quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings, such that it is difficult to deal with:  Ontario Law Reform Commission, supra, at pp. 189-90; see also Alberta Law Reform Institute, Report No. 62, Proposals for the Reform of the Public Inquiries Act (1992); P. Robardet, ""Should We Abandon the Adversarial Model in Favour of the Inquisitorial Model in Commissions of Inquiry?"", in A. P. Pross, I. Christie and J. A. Yogis, eds., Commissions of Inquiry (1990), 111.  Admittedly, in Irvine v. Canada (Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 181, Estey J. stated that (at p. 231):


page 540


     Fairness is a flexible concept and its content varies depending on the nature of the inquiry and the consequences for the individuals involved.  The characteristics of the proceeding, the nature of the resulting report and its circulation to the public, and the penalties which will result when events succeeding the report are put in train will determine the extent of the right to counsel and, where counsel is authorized by statute without further directive, the role of such counsel.
     I mean to cast no doubt here upon such an analysis, nor upon the related suggestion that ""[i]n the pre-Nicholson era a number of authorities shifted the emphasis away from a process of classification of the tribunal in question to the effect of the statutory procedure on the individual appearing in the administrative process"" (p. 216).
     As I understand it, however, the dichotomy between quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings can be regarded as false to the extent that one is concerned with determining which requirements of natural justice or procedural fairness should attach to proceedings.  When this is the goal, instead of labelling the proceedings, it is helpful to analyze their effect upon individuals as Estey J. discussed in Irvine, supra.  However, I am not here concerned with defining the scope of procedural protection due a witness who is compelled to testify in proceedings which have an otherwise acknowledged validity, but rather with the substantive question whether an inquiry which purports to compel testimony can exist in such a form at all.  I have noted above that to analyze the effects of compellability is to pursue an impotent means of substantive analysis.
     Therefore, at the end of the day, I think we must be on guard to acknowledge the ""subtle crisis"" perceived by Ratushny, that is, the crisis of principle which would arise if we failed to note that adversarialism is in competition with the inquisitorial mode of proceeding.  Of this crisis, Ratushny has made two points of particular consequence.  First, he has acknowledged that to permit departures from the adversarial model may be ""a natural, logical and desirable development"", although  


page 541

admittedly one which requires careful re-assessment of our system:  Self-Incrimination in the Canadian Criminal Process, supra, at p. 35.  Second, in consequence of the required re-assessment, ""extreme caution must be observed in any attempt to adapt solutions proposed elsewhere to our unique circumstances"":  id., at p. 40.  We cannot avoid the conclusion that a Canadian solution to this problem is required.
     At this juncture, I return for a moment to reconsider Batary, supra.  As the Ontario Law Reform Commission has noted, supra, at p. 70, it is interesting that ""[n]either Cartwright J. nor Fauteux J. [in Batary] discussed whether the legislation establishing the coroner's inquest was properly within provincial jurisdiction"".  Instead, in the majority reasons of Cartwright J., it is as if the addition of the power to compel testimony to the coroner's arsenal was sufficient, by itself, to render the proceedings criminal in nature.  Perhaps Cartwright J. saw the coroner as a police officer armed with a subpoena.  What is especially instructive, to my mind, is the fact that Cartwright J. did not strike down the governing legislation itself, but only the impugned power to compel testimony.  Perhaps, in light of a broad inquisitorial context, the simple addition of the subpoena power led to an irresistible inference of colourability.  Thus, in a case which involves a provincial inquiry, it may be that the demands of s. 7  of the Charter  will parallel the division-of-powers analysis (and we are not called upon today to rehear cases decided subsequent to Batary).  That which would be ultra vires as criminal law for the provinces might also be rejected by s. 7 .  But, of course, there is the additional potency of the Charter  to consider, such that the Charter  would also demand this result in respect of a comparable federal effort.


page 542


     These comments are a sufficient introduction to the problem as I perceive it.  I will go no further in these reasons toward defining the scope of permissible inquiries, since the facts do not demand it.  Moreover, I express no comment as to the form of remedial response which might be devised in a case which involves a statutory compulsion to speak appearing in a colourable context.
     On the facts of this case, to the extent that the witness J.P.M. might be compelled to testify in proceedings which have the character of an inquiry in relation to him, it is also true that those proceedings have a very definite character in Canadian law vis-à-vis the appellant, R.J.S.  The proceedings in question can be defined with certainty, in so far as R.J.S. was ""charged with an offence"" under the Criminal Code .  As R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541, makes clear, a person can be regarded as ""charged with an offence"" for the purposes of s. 11  of the Charter  because a matter is ""by its very nature...a criminal proceeding or because a conviction in respect of the offence may lead to a true penal consequence"" (p. 559).  The public purpose of resultant proceedings can be defined by the fact that they are ""intended to promote public order and welfare within a public sphere of activity"" (p. 560), and, in light of the enumerated protections of s. 11 , that known purpose will be accompanied by the adversarial character of the proceedings in relation to the accused.
     Having defined the case this way, I believe it follows naturally that, although the trial against R.J.S. might be considered an inquiry in relation to J.P.M. as witness, the inquiry is of the sort permitted by our law.  The search for truth in a criminal trial against a named accused has an obvious social utility, and the truth-seeking goal operates to limit effectively the scope of the proceedings in terms of the ""inquiry effect"".  The laws of relevancy would preclude the random examination of individuals within a criminal trial.  It also follows that I disapprove of obiter suggestions which might lead to a contrary result:  e.g., Re Welton and The Queen   


page 543

(1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Zurlo (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Que. C.A.); and Praisoody, supra.
     Before concluding on this issue, however, I should add a few thoughts.  It has been repeatedly suggested that the Crown might be able to subvert the principle against self-incrimination by proceeding with separate criminal trials with the manifest purpose of thus obtaining compelled testimony.  First, for the reasons which follow dealing with the scope of evidentiary immunity available in Canada, this is a procedure which the Crown adopts at its own peril; there may be costs associated with the Crown's ability to prosecute later a compelled witness (and I would add that these are costs the Crown might happily pay when the decision is made to pursue a conviction against W at the possible expense of the ability to convict the less threatening witnesses, X, Y, and Z).
     Second, however, if it be suggested that the Crown might choose to prosecute an accused, having first prepared no case to meet and only for the purpose of subpoenaing a witness, then it would seem to me that an objection should lie, not only because the purpose of the proceedings can no longer be defined by the adversarial contest between the state and the so-called accused, but also because the prosecution would amount to an abuse of process, being ""conduct which shocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention"":  R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 615.  There is more than one way to check the progress of a fishing expedition, but a decision to proceed separately does not, in and of itself, amount to an abuse of process:  see R. v. Crooks (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 193 (H.C.); and R. v. Mazur (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R. xi.  This is especially clear on the facts of this case, inasmuch as the decision to proceed separately was prompted  


page 544

by an administrative procedure rather than a Crown strategy.
     In conclusion, the witness J.P.M. was properly compellable at the trial of R.J.S., and the trial judge erred in quashing the subpoena.  His proposed testimony falls to be governed by the general rule applicable under the Charter , pursuant to which a witness is compellable to testify, and pursuant to which such a witness receives evidentiary immunity in compensation.  In the context of this appeal, the overriding principle against self-incrimination is satisfied by this structure.  I turn now to the final issue which engages this selfsame principle, namely, the nature of the immunity protection required.
     (d)Immunity Protection Under the Charter
     Once it has been established that a witness who is compellable under the general rule will receive, in return, immunity protection only, then there is little reason to suppose that a provision which purports only to abolish the common-law privilege against self-incrimination (such as s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act ) might be impugned by the Charter .  In this regard, I note that it was suggested in Thomson Newspapers, supra, that the absence of derivative-use immunity in s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  might be a fatal deficiency; see also Dubois, supra.  However, as La Forest J. noted in Thomson Newspapers, ""where the statute does not provide for the evidence to be admitted, there can really be no breach of the Charter  until unfair evidence is admitted"" (p. 559).
     In other words, s. 5(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  abolishes the common-law privilege against self-incrimination, with the result that a compellable witness must answer questions posed.  Section 5(2)  offers such a witness protection in the form of an immunity.  Neither subsection purports to make evidence of any kind necessarily admissible at a subsequent proceeding, and like La Forest J. in Thomson Newspapers, supra, I would not strain to  


page 545

read the provision this way.  Thus, if an immunity larger than the one provided by s. 5(2)  is required by the Charter , nothing in the Canada Evidence Act  would offend the requirement.
     To my mind, an analysis which suggests the opposite confuses the Charter  with the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  As already described, that amendment constitutionalizes the common-law testimonial privileges.  In this context, it has been held that the abrogation of the privilege must be met with a coextensive immunity protection by way of statute.  The extent of protection required was initially thought to be transactional immunity (freedom from prosecution, see Counselman, supra), but this position was later pared back to favour a requirement for complete derivative-use immunity:  Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441 (1972).
     What should be obvious in the American context, but perhaps is not, is that a statute in that country which purports to abrogate a testimonial privilege is in direct violation of the Fifth Amendment.  As a general rule, a statute which purports to do the same thing in Canada is in direct violation of nothing at all.  A comparable situation could arise here only in the unlikely event that a statute purported to abrogate s. 11 (c) of the Charter , so as to render an accused person compellable.  Although I reject the idea in the context of the general rule of witness compellability (and express no comment outside of that context), I can only envision the need to strike down s. 5  at this stage if I assume that a compelled witness needs more immunity than s. 13 of the Charter offers, and if I further assume that the additional immunity is susceptible only of a legislative solution because of its complexity:  see, e.g., Haywood Securities, supra, per Lambert J.A. dissenting.
     Thus, I do not believe that s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  can be impeached at this stage of the analysis, and the only real question is whether s.  


page 546

13 of the Charter  exclusively defines the scope of the available evidentiary immunity.  In other words, is protection against derivative evidence required?  Of course, to the extent that protection against the subsequent use of evidence has become my focus at this stage, my answer to this question takes me beyond the necessary confines of this appeal.  Once it is said that J.P.M. is compellable and that s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  is not now endangered, the principal part of this appeal has been resolved.  This point notwithstanding, a complete treatment of the topic requires some discussion of immunity.
     In the analysis above, I discussed derivative evidence in general terms, and characterized it as being evidence which comes to light as a result of a compelled disclosure.  This reference was deliberate and it was offered in anticipation of the following terminological debate:
     Assuming that the protection against the use of compelled evidence extends to the use of derivative evidence, there remains a fundamental problem in defining ""derivative evidence"".  There are four possible types of evidence that might be categorized as derivative:  (1) evidence that could have been discovered only as a result of the testimony; (2) evidence that was discovered as a result of the testimony, but that could have been discovered without such testimony; (3) evidence that would, or would probably, have been discovered even without the testimony; and (4) evidence that was discovered after the testimony was given, but independently of the testimony.
     (Ontario Law Reform Commission, supra, at p. 125.)
     As I use the term, evidence is ""derivative"" if it results, in fact, from a compelled disclosure.  I agree with Wilson J.'s statement in Thomson Newspapers, supra, to the effect that ""causality is the sine qua non of derivative evidence"" (p. 484).  Only evidence which comes to light as a result of a compelled disclosure interests me here.  There is little, if any, relationship between independently  


page 547

obtained evidence and the principle against self-incrimination.

As regards other kinds of evidence, however, a relationship may be evident.  As a point of terminology, though, I wish to emphasize that all evidence arising from a compelled disclosure is ""derivative evidence"".  The question whether some of that evidence ought to be excluded under the Charter  invokes a separate analysis.  That analysis is logically geared toward defining the possible scope of ""derivative-use immunity"".  An immunity might be coextensive with the category of evidence to which it is responsive, or it might not.  The point is that the label ""derivative evidence"" is not of conclusive importance under a Charter  which operates in immunity terms.
     To proceed I ask:  what, if anything, does the Charter demand in respect of derivative-use immunity?  In the analysis to follow, I will suggest that the Charter  does not demand absolute derivative-use immunity, and to that extent I will agree with the second polar view described above which has been advanced by Paciocco, supra.  However, I will also disagree with Paciocco in that I believe it is necessary to recognize a residual kind of immunity to protect the operation of the Charter  as a meaningful system.  I will invoke three points of support for these conclusions:  first, I will note that there are significant problems inherent in the idea of full derivative-use immunity; second, I will discuss the history of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , and I will suggest that this history informs the interpretation of the Charter ; third, I will discuss s. 24(2)  of the Charter .
     As already noted, the United States Supreme Court in Kastigar, supra, established that a statute could legitimately purport to abrogate the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution if the statute replaces its protection with co-extensive immunity, which was characterized in Kastigar, supra as being complete derivative-use immunity.   


page 548

In moving to this position, the Court backed away from the perceived authority of Counselman, supra, that a coextensive immunity resides only in the complete freedom from prosecution, or transactional immunity.  However, although there is a legitimate difference in theory between derivative-use and transactional immunity, the practical difference between these protections may be negligible indeed.  I agree with the following commentary from Thomson Newspapers, supra, at pp. 557-58 (per La Forest J.):
     [T]he practical effect of conferring derivative use immunity is in many cases virtually indistinguishable from the conferral of immunity from prosecution;  see M. Berger, Taking the Fifth:  The Supreme Court and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination (1980), at p. 72.  That is because it is in many cases extremely difficult for the prosecution to prove that the evidence it seeks to introduce against an accused who has been compelled to testify is not in fact derived from that testimony.  It must be remembered that it would not be enough for the Crown to prove simply that the evidence could have been obtained independently of their testimony; that would not preclude actual reliance on the leads found in the compelled testimony.  Instead, it must be proved that the evidence was in fact found independently of the compelled testimony.  In the wake of an even relatively complex investigation where many different and reinforcing leads and mere hunches have played a part in guiding the investigators, what could possibly constitute such proof?
     As La Forest J. proceeds to discuss in Thomson Newspapers, the effect of a complete derivative-use immunity may be to afford the compelled witness an ""immunity bath"", or a complete transactional immunity in respect of matters touching upon the compelled testimony.
     My concern with respect to the difficulty of distinguishing an absolute derivative-use immunity from a transactional immunity relates to the second point I will discuss, namely, the relevance of s. 5(2) ",1995-02-02 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

on appeal from the court of appeal for
british columbia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Motor vehicles ‑‑ Demand for breath sample ‑‑ Roadside
screening test ‑‑ Police officer authorized to demand that driver
provide breath sample ""forthwith"" for screening test ‑‑
Whether ""fail"" result per se provides reasonable and probable grounds
to demand breathalyzer ‑‑ Whether officer must ascertain when
driver consumed last drink or wait at least 15 minutes before administering
screening test ‑‑ Whether ""forthwith"" means immediately
or whether it may encompass 15‑minute delay ‑‑ Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 254(2) , (3) .

 

                   A police officer
pulled the accused's vehicle over after he had noticed it travelling over the
speed limit and drifting from the far side of the shoulder to the centre of the
road and back again with the brake lights flickering.  He noticed a smell of
liquor coming from the accused, whose eyes were red and glassy.  When asked,
the accused admitted that he had been drinking.  The officer then made a demand
for a breath sample for an ALERT roadside screening test pursuant to
s. 254(2)  of the Criminal Code , which provides that a police
officer may demand that a driver provide a sample of breath
""forthwith"" when the officer suspects that the driver has alcohol in
the body.  The accused complied and the screening device recorded a
""fail"" result.  The officer stated that when he obtained the fail
reading he formed the opinion that the accused's ability to operate a motor
vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  He read him the standard breathalyzer demand
and took him to the police station, where the accused provided two breath
samples, both of which were well over the prescribed limit of .08.  At trial an
expert witness testified that the presence of alcohol in the mouth of a person
being tested can falsely elevate the reading on a screening device and give a
false result.  Thus, police officers were advised to ascertain when the last
drink was consumed and, if they were unable to do so, to wait 15 minutes before
administering the test.  The RCMP screening device course manual recommended a
delay of 15 minutes in order to allow mouth alcohol to dissipate.  The
manufacturer's operation manual recommended waiting 20 minutes before
administering the ALERT test where the subject had recently had a drink, or
regurgitated or vomited, to allow any mouth alcohol to be dispersed.  The
accused argued that the results of the breathalyzer test should be excluded on
the grounds that the officer did not have the reasonable and probable grounds
required to make the breathalyzer demand because he knew or ought to have known
that the fail result recorded on the screening device might have been
inaccurate due to the presence of mouth alcohol.  The trial judge nonetheless
admitted the breathalyzer test results and the accused was convicted of having
care and control of a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of over .08.  His
summary conviction appeal was dismissed, but the Court of Appeal set aside the
conviction and substituted a verdict of acquittal.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier,
McLachlin and Major JJ.:   Where a police officer believes on reasonable
and probable grounds that a person has committed an offence pursuant to
s. 253 of the Code, the officer may demand a breathalyzer.  Section
254(3) of the Code requires that the police officer subjectively have an
honest belief that the suspect has committed the offence and objectively there
must exist reasonable grounds for this belief.  Parliament has set up a
statutory scheme whereby a screening test can be administered by the police merely
upon entertaining a reasonable suspicion that alcohol is in a person's body.  A
""fail"" result may be considered, along with any other indicia of
impairment, in order to provide the police officer with the necessary
reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breathalyzer.  A ""fail""
result per se, however, may not provide reasonable and probable
grounds.  Where there is evidence that the police officer knew that the suspect
had recently consumed alcohol and expert evidence shows that the subsequent
screening test would be unreliable due to the presence of alcohol in the mouth,
it cannot be decreed, as a matter of law, that both the subjective and
objective tests have been satisfied.  The requirement in s. 254(3)  that
reasonable and probable grounds exist is not only a statutory but a
constitutional requirement as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure
under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   If the scientific
evidence establishes a high degree of unreliability when certain conditions
prevail, and if a police officer knows, for example based on his or her
training, that the resultant screening device will provide inaccurate results
where a suspect has consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to
administering the test, we cannot, as a matter of law, tell a police officer
that his honest answer as to his belief that there were no reasonable and
probable grounds is wrong.

 

                   While the screening
test should be administered as soon as possible, the fact that there is a two‑hour
limit for the breathalyzer test suggests that a 15‑minute delay would not
offend the provision nor the scheme of s. 254 of the Code.  The
statutory provisions must allow the time required to take a proper test.  Under
s. 254(2), the police officer is specifically entitled to demand a breath
sample which enables a proper analysis of the breath.  This flexible approach
is in accord with the purpose of the statutory scheme and ensures that a police
officer has an honest belief based on reasonable and probable grounds prior to
making a breathalyzer demand.  Waiting 15 minutes is permitted under s. 254(2)
of the Code when this is in accordance with the exigencies of the use of
the equipment.  It strikes the proper balance between Parliament's objective in
combatting the evils of drinking and driving, on the one hand, and the rights
of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.

 

                   While there were
several other potential indicia of impairment in this case aside from the
evidence provided by the screening test, the police officer apparently did not
form a belief based on reasonable and probable grounds until after
administering the roadside screening test.  Assuming this to be the case, he
was entitled to rely on the ""fail"" result of the screening test,
however, since there was no evidence with respect to the timing of the
accused's last drink.  Thus, it is too speculative to assert that the screening
device result was unreliable.  Where the particular screening device used has
been approved under the statutory scheme, the officer is entitled to rely on
its accuracy unless there is credible evidence to the contrary.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.:  Drinking and driving leaves a terrible trail of death,
injury, heartbreak and destruction.  To address this problem, Parliament
enacted a two‑stage statutory scheme set out in s. 254(2)  and (3)  of
the Criminal Code  to provide a means of testing for driver impairment. 
The first stage sets out a means of screening drivers and is a preliminary
investigation aimed at determining whether a driver may constitute a danger to
the public because of alcohol in his system.  At the second stage, the
statutory scheme is aimed at precisely determining the driver's level of
alcohol.  It is only at this second stage that it will be ascertained whether
the alcohol level is over the prescribed limit, thus constituting a criminal
offence.  The ALERT testing devices are tools approved for use at the first
stage.  They provide a means whereby drivers can be quickly screened, and cause
far less inconvenience to drivers than would a breathalyzer test.

 

                   The ALERT test is
to be carried out ""forthwith"", which should be interpreted as meaning
""immediately"".  Section 254(2)  does not anticipate, require or
include a 15‑minute delay to allow residual mouth alcohol to dissipate
either prior to making the demand or prior to administering the test.  This 15‑minute
postponement would only be necessary to accommodate drinkers with indigestion
or, more frequently, those who see fit to take a drink shortly before driving
their car.  It is entirely reasonable that the driver who does take a drink in
those circumstances should be prepared to accept the consequences.  If, as a
consequence of taking a drink shortly before driving, there is in fact an
unusually high level of residual mouth alcohol, the results of the false ALERT
reading will be rectified by the breathalyzer test, which requires a 15‑minute
observation period before it is performed.  The requirement to undergo the
ALERT testing immediately should be regarded as one of the obligations that
flow from the right to drive.  An impaired driver is a potentially lethal
hazard that must be detected and removed from the road as quickly as possible. 
The ability to administer the test immediately helps to protect the public by
detecting those who may be a danger.  The relatively rare occasions on which an
ALERT test may be erroneous as a result of the driver consuming a very recent
drink must be tolerated in the interest of the safety of the public.

 

                   The flexible
approach to s. 254(2) , whereby a police officer may postpone the
administration of the test for 15 minutes where he or she is of the opinion
that a breath sample will be contaminated because of the presence of mouth
alcohol, should not be adopted.  The demand for an ALERT test must be made
immediately in every situation when a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the
body has been established.  The wording of the Code indicates that a 15‑minute
delay is not contemplated by the two‑stage screening and testing
procedure set out in s. 254(2)  and (3) .  The whole scheme anticipates a
very brief detention and immediate application of the screening test.  As well,
a delay of 15 minutes might not be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   Once a police
officer has a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body, the use of the ALERT
test is warranted and the officer may rely on the results of that test in order
to make a breathalyzer demand.  The mere possibility that the ALERT test might have
been inaccurate because of alcohol consumed shortly before driving and within
the 15 minutes prior to the test is insufficient to invalidate the
reasonableness of the officer's belief based on the result of the test.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  The
ALERT test, a device approved by Parliament, is, when properly administered to
the knowledge of the officer, itself sufficient grounds to found the belief on
reasonable and probable grounds required to warrant a breathalyzer demand.  The
present case requires this Court to adopt an approach to s. 254(2)  and (3)  that
attempts to balance to the greatest extent possible the conflicting values
underlying ss. 8  and 10 (b) of the Charter .  ""Reasonable and
probable grounds"" is not only a statutory precondition to a breathalyzer
demand but also a touchstone of the Charter , since under s. 8 
individuals are not to be subject to unreasonable interference with their
reasonable expectations of privacy.  Such grounds ordinarily have both a
subjective and an objective component.  Roadside assessments of drivers'
sobriety, however, are an activity in which the reasonable expectation of
privacy is lower owing both to the nature of the activity and to the nature of
the means available to regulate it.  When individuals obtain a driver's
licence, they accept the many responsibilities that come with that privilege
and, most importantly, undertake a responsibility to others to conduct
themselves safely on the nation's roadways.  It is also common knowledge that
impaired driving is dangerous and that the state must take certain measures to
curb this pressing problem.  Any reasonable expectation of privacy which people
who drink and drive may entertain while in their vehicle is therefore lower
with respect to assessments of their sobriety than with respect to most other
activities that do not raise similar considerations.  In the interests of
certainty and given the very special context of both the problem of impaired
driving and the means reasonably available to address that problem, some innovation
with respect to the subjective component of ""reasonable and probable
grounds"" is thus justifiable in order to further Parliament's manifest
purpose of effectively addressing, curtailing, and deterring the bane of
impaired driving through the screening test scheme.

 

                   Having regard to
the values underlying s. 10 (b) of the Charter  and the fact
that no penal consequences flow from the screening test results, officers
should generally administer the ALERT test without delay.  There may be
circumstances, however, in which it is not only advisable but actually
objectively necessary for the officer to wait a certain period of time in order
to obtain a proper sample, such as to prevent damage to the device's detector
cell due to smoke, or where the officer has actually seen the accused consume
alcohol or belch or regurgitate.

 

                   Police are strongly
encouraged to develop a standard practice in the future, which will enable the
screening tests to be administered with greater ease and certainty.  Namely,
whenever the officer honestly believes that the motorist has engaged in
activity within the last 15 minutes that could affect the reliability of the
test, he or she should read a prepared statement to the motorist, advising that
person of the reason for, and necessity of, the delay.  The officer should not
question the motorist as to recent consumption, but the reading of this
statement may cause the motorist to volunteer additional information that will
enable the officer to administer the test immediately.  In any case, the
officer will then be able to rely both reasonably and honestly on the screening
test result as a basis for a breathalyzer demand.  Administering the test in
this manner ensures that the procedure is minimally impairing of the motorist's
s. 10 (b) rights, yet also remains as consistent as possible with the
values underlying s. 8  of the Charter .

 

                   Where an officer
waits a reasonable amount of time in order to ensure that the ALERT test yields
accurate results, this delay is not inconsistent with the requirement in
s. 254(2)  that the sample be provided ""forthwith"".  The
admission of breathalyzer evidence obtained in such circumstances, even if it
were obtained in violation of the Charter , could hardly be seen to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

                   In this case the
officer was entitled to rely on the ""fail"" registered by the
screening device as no evidence was adduced that suggested that the officer was
aware of recent alcohol consumption or any other factors that could reasonably
affect the reliability of the device.

 

                   Per Gonthier J.:  L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s
suggestions as to certain police procedures being desirable in the
circumstances described, though not mandatory, were agreed with.

                   The reasons of
Lamer C.J. and Cory and Iacobucci JJ. were delivered by

 

1                 Cory
J. -- The issue raised on this appeal is the manner in which the various
types of roadside screening tests (the ALERT test) should be administered. 
Specifically, should a police officer who suspects a driver of having alcohol
in the body administer the ALERT test immediately, or must there be a 15‑
to 20‑minute waiting period in order to allow any possible residual mouth
alcohol to evaporate?

 

The Factual Background

 

2                 At about 10:35 p.m. on an April
evening in 1991, Constable Mashford noticed a car travelling at 65 km in a
50 km zone.  On two occasions he saw the car drift from the far side of
the shoulder to the centre of the road and back again with the brake lights
flickering.  He was concerned and pulled the vehicle over.  At 10:36 p.m.,
the officer asked the respondent for his licence and the car registration
papers.  He noticed a smell of liquor coming from the respondent, whose eyes
were red and glassy.  He asked the respondent if he had been drinking and he
replied that he had.  At this point the officer made a demand for a breath
sample for the ALERT device.  The respondent complied.  The screening device,
an Alcolmeter S-L2, recorded a ""fail"" mark.

 

3                 The officer stated that when he
obtained the fail reading he formed the opinion that the respondent's ability
to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  As a result of this
decision, the officer testified that he read the respondent the standard
breathalyzer demand, advised him of his rights under the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and advised him of the availability of legal aid and
duty counsel.  The respondent was taken to the police station.  There he was
given a list of legal aid lawyers and advised that he could make a phone call
if he wished to do so.  The respondent specifically declined to call a lawyer
and provided two breath samples, 18 minutes apart, both of which were well
over the prescribed limit of .08.

 

4                 Mr. Benny Wong, as an expert
witness, testified on behalf of the respondent pertaining to the procedures
that are involved in the breathalyzer test and the screening device test.  He
stated that the presence of alcohol in the mouth of a person being tested can
falsely elevate the reading on a screening device.  Mr. Wong also stated that
police officers were advised to ascertain when the last drink was consumed and,
if they were unable to do so, they should wait 15 minutes before administering
the approved screening device test.

 

5                 Evidence was also adduced that
the ALERT manufacturer's operation manual advised that mouth alcohol may
falsely raise the reading on a screening device test.  Further, the manual
indicated that an inaccurate and elevated reading would be obtained if the
driver who had been drinking burped or regurgitated.  In each of these
circumstances, the manufacturer recommended waiting 20 minutes before
administering the ALERT test.

 

6                 In this case, the officer was
not asked questions pertaining to his training.  In particular, he was not
asked whether he had been advised to find out when the driver's last drink had
been consumed or to wait 15 minutes before administering the test.  On the
other hand, there was no evidence adduced which would indicate that the respondent
had taken a drink within 15 minutes prior to taking the ALERT test.

 

7                 The respondent argued that the
results of the breathalyzer test should be excluded on the grounds that the
constable did not have the reasonable and probable grounds required to make the
breathalyzer demand.  It was contended that the constable lacked these
requisite grounds because he knew or ought to have known that the fail result
recorded on the screening device might have been inaccurate due to the presence
of mouth alcohol.  The trial court judge, nonetheless, admitted the
breathalyzer test results and the respondent was convicted of having care and
control of a vehicle ""over .08"" contrary to s. 253 (b) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  The summary
conviction appeal was dismissed.  However, the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia set aside the conviction and substituted a verdict of acquittal: 
(1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 404, 28 B.C.A.C. 247, 47 W.A.C. 247, 48 M.V.R. (2d) 246.

Decisions of the
Courts Below

 

A.  British
Columbia Provincial Court

 

8                 MacKenzie Prov. Ct. J. held that
the Crown had no obligation to prove that the screening device was operating
properly in order for a police officer to rely on a ""fail"" reading. 
Further, the Crown need not adduce evidence to show what a ""fail""
reading means in order for the police officer to rely on it to establish
reasonable and probable grounds to believe the driver is impaired.

 

9                 He held that evidence which
tends to show the possible reduced reliability of the screening device does not
preclude a police officer from relying on it to establish reasonable and
probable grounds to believe the offence was committed.  He found that ""it
is clear from the different wording in the respective sections dealing with
ALERT demands and breathalyzer demands that parliament intended there to be a
difference between the two procedures and possible consequences""; and that
this was ""why there is a requirement in [s. 254(2) ] for an immediate or
forthwith compliance with the demand, whereas in [s. 254(3) ] the demand is
forthwith or as soon as practicable"".  Furthermore, ""the consequences
of failing the respective devices are dramatically different"".

 

10               MacKenzie Prov. Ct. J. relied on
the decisions in R. v. Grant, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 139, and in R. v.
Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, as the basis for concluding that the word
""forthwith"" in s. 254(2)  of the Criminal Code  meant that an
officer was to administer the approved screening device test without observing
a 15-minute waiting period.  He stated that ""this inconvenience or
possibility of a false high reading is a reasonable price to pay in an attempt
to effectively deal with the problem of impaired driving"".  He found that
the fail result from the approved screening device provided the constable with
reasonable and probable grounds to make a breathalyzer demand and, since there
were no Charter  violations, admitted the evidence of the breathalyzer
test results.

 

B.  British
Columbia Supreme Court

 

11               Millward J. held that s. 254(2) 
should be interpreted so that ""in appropriate circumstances"" a police
officer should take reasonable precautions to ensure that the approved
screening device is likely to give a fair and appropriate reading.  Millward J.
concluded that ""that is a fair reading and that is the proper reading to
be given on a simple, straightforward interpretation of the words of the
section"".  He concluded that, in the present case, the constable did not
reasonably ensure the reading would be accurate because he did not wait 15
minutes to allow mouth alcohol to dissipate.

 

12               However, Millward J. felt
compelled to follow the guidelines established in R. v. Gartrell (1992),
72 C.C.C. (3d) 51 (B.C.S.C.), in which it was held that when an officer was in
possession of a roadside screening device at the time of the detention, the
test should be administered as quickly as possible.  Therefore he upheld the
conviction.

 

C.  British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 404

 

                   1.  Per
Hutcheon J.A.

 

13               Hutcheon J.A. observed that, on
the basis of the evidence, one could not say that the officer believed on
reasonable and probable grounds that the respondent had committed an offence
under s. 253  ""so as to justify a demand for a sample of breath""
(p. 410).  He found that the officer required a result of ""fail""
to raise his suspicion to a belief on reasonable and probable grounds, and
concluded (at p. 410) that:

 

                   In
my view, it follows that if the result ""Fail"" may be unreliable to
the knowledge of the police officer, he cannot be said to believe on reasonable
and probable grounds that the further test was justified.  It would not be
reasonable for the officer to have the belief on the basis of a result that may
be unreliable.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   In
my opinion, the failure of the police officer to take the precautions necessary
to ensure the reliability of the test by the screening device leads to the
conclusion that he did not have reasonable and probable ground to make the
demand under s. 254(3) .  It follows that the evidence of the breathalyzer
readings is not admissible.

 

                   2.  Per
McEachern C.J.B.C. (concurring)

 

14               McEachern C.J.B.C. stated that the
result reached by Hutcheon J.A. was legally correct because the language of the
Criminal Code  and the evidence adduced at the trial ""admits no
other conclusion"" (p. 405).  He found that the Criminal Code 
established a procedure to obtain a breath sample for analysis which was to be
followed before the results of that analysis became admissible at trial.  He
concluded (at pp. 406‑7) that:

 

. . . the
officer made it clear that he only formed the opinion that an offence had been
committed when he got the ""Fail"" reading.

 

                   It
follows, therefore, that the officer did not have authority to demand the
second sample for analysis, and the results of that analysis were, accordingly,
inadmissible.

 

                   The
learned judges in the courts below concluded that s. 254(3) of the Code
requires the breath sample to be taken as soon as practicable.  With respect,
that is another question.  Without reasonable and probable grounds, there is no
authority to demand a sample at all.

 

                   However,
I do not wish to be understood as saying that in the absence of information
about when the last drink was taken, the police cannot detain a suspected
driver until the required period has elapsed.... I only decide that the police
cannot use a questionable reading as the basis for reasonable and
probable grounds for a breathalyzer demand.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Issues on Appeal

 

1.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law by reading into s. 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code  a requirement that a peace officer either ascertain when a subject
consumed his last drink of alcohol or wait for a period of 15 minutes
before administering an approved screening device test?

 

2.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law in ruling that unless a peace officer either
ascertains when a driver consumed his last drink of alcohol or waits at least
15 minutes before administering an approved screening device test, then he
cannot rely on a fail reading on the approved screening device test in making a
breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

3.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law in ruling, contrary to the decision in Rilling
v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 183, that the results of an analysis of
breath samples performed with an approved breathalyzer instrument are
automatically inadmissible in evidence if the Crown has not proved that the
officer who made the demand for breath samples had reasonable and probable
grounds as set out in s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

Analysis

 

15               Section 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code  provides that when a police officer suspects that a driver has alcohol
in the body, the officer may demand that the driver provide
""forthwith"" a sample of breath for a roadside ALERT test.  The
question is whether ""forthwith"" means immediately or whether it may,
in certain circumstances, encompass a 15‑minute delay.  In order to
answer this question, it is necessary to consider both the gravity of the
problem caused by drinking and driving and the Criminal Code  provisions
enacted to meet that problem.

 

Problems Arising from
Drinking and Driving

 

16               Every year, drunk driving leaves a
terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction.  From the point of
view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any
other crime.  In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in
hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most
significant social loss to the country.  Statistics Canada recently noted:

 

                   Impaired
driving is a serious crime.  Every year thousands of Canadians are killed and
many more injured in traffic-related accidents.  Alcohol is a contributing
factor in an average of 43% of these cases (Traffic Injury Research Foundation
-- D. R. Mayhew et al. [Alcohol Use Among Persons Fatally Injured in Motor
Vehicle Accidents:  Canada 1990] 1992:33).

 

(""Impaired
Driving ‑‑ Canada, 1991"" (1992), 12:17 Juristat 1, at
p. 2.)

 

17               Statistics Canada has compiled a
variety of figures with respect to motor vehicle accidents in general.  Between
1983 and 1991, 41,000 individuals died in traffic accidents in Canada.  A
further 2.5 million people were injured:  ""Impaired Driving ‑‑
Canada, 1992"" (1994), 14:5 Juristat 1.  In 1992, the total number
of deaths resulting from motor vehicle accidents was 3,289:  Causes of Death
1992 (1994), at pp. 246-51.  This figure includes drivers, passengers,
cyclists, and pedestrians.  In 1987, motor vehicle accidents were responsible
for injuries requiring 762,000 days of in‑hospital medical treatment and
causing 12 million days of lost activity and employment:  Accidents in
Canada (1991), at pp. 61-64.

 

18               Statistics Canada observed that
alcohol is a contributing factor in 43 percent of those motor vehicle
accidents which cause death and injury.  Interpreting Statistics Canada's
general motor vehicle accident statistics with reference to this 43 percent
figure, it would seem that alcohol was a contributing factor in:

 

                   -      some 17,630
individual deaths between 1983 and 1991;

 

                   -approximately
1,075,000 individuals injured between 1983 and 1991;

 

                   -about
1,414 additional deaths (including drivers, passengers, cyclists and
pedestrians) in 1992;

 

                   -327,660
days of in‑hospital medical treatment in 1987; and

 

                   -5,160,000
days of lost activity and employment in 1987.

 

19               These dry figures are mute but
shocking testimony demonstrating the tragic effects and devastating
consequences of drinking and driving.  The social cost of the crime, great as
it is, fades in comparison to the personal loss suffered by the victims of this
crime through the death and injury of their loved ones.  The gravity of the
problem and its impact on Canadian society has been so great that Criminal
Code  amendments were enacted aimed at eliminating or, at least, reducing
the problem.

 

Criminal Code Provisions
Aimed at Eliminating or Reducing the Problem

 

20               To address the problem, Parliament
enacted a two-stage statutory scheme set out in s. 254(2)  and (3)  of the Criminal
Code  to provide a means of testing for driver impairment.  Overly
simplified, it may be said that at the first stage, a means of screening
drivers is set out.  It is a preliminary investigation aimed at determining
whether a driver may constitute a danger to the public because of alcohol in
his system.  At the second stage, the statutory scheme is aimed at precisely
determining the driver's level of alcohol.  It is only at this second stage
that it will be ascertained whether the alcohol level is over the prescribed
limit, thus constituting a criminal offence.

 

21               The ALERT testing devices are
simply tools approved by Parliament for use at the first stage of the
investigation of drivers who may be impaired.  They provide a means whereby
drivers can be quickly screened.  The tested drivers will fall into two
groups:  those who have alcohol in their systems and those who do not or only
have a low level.  By this statutory scheme, Parliament has recognized the need
to balance the competing concerns of accuracy and convenience to the general
motoring public.  The ALERT test used as an investigatory tool obviously causes
far less inconvenience to a driver than would a breathalyzer test.  A driver
who fails an ALERT test is not subject to criminal liability but may be
required to take the more accurate breathalyzer test provided for in
s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code .

 

22               It is the breathalyzer test which
is concerned with criminal liability.  As one might expect, detailed
procedures, set out in s. 258, govern the administration of this test. 
Section 258 requires that the breath samples be taken as soon as
practicable after the offence was committed.  The first breath sample should be
taken within two hours of the offence.  An interval of at least 15 minutes must
precede the second test and each test after that.  This procedure will allow
the police to further monitor and observe the accused and to ensure that the
test result will be accurate.

 

How Should the ALERT
Test Be Conducted So That the Sample Will Be Provided ""Forthwith""?

 

23               Section 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code  provides that the ALERT test should be carried out
""forthwith"".  The meaning of that word should be ascertained by first
examining its place in the context of the broader statutory scheme designed to
detect drunk drivers.  The two‑stage investigative procedure set out in
s. 254(2)  and (3)  and the ALERT test itself are designed to be both
helpful to the police and convenient to the driving public.  The ALERT test is
a portable screening device which provides results quickly.  It enables police
officers to rapidly confirm or reject their suspicions that a driver is
impaired due to alcohol consumption.  As well, it permits drivers who safely
blow ""pass"" levels on the device to proceed on their way with a
minimum of inconvenience.  The whole scheme of ALERT testing is based on the
concept that drivers will be detained for a very short period.  This Court has
in fact recognized that the ALERT test must be administered immediately and
that the detention under s. 254(2)  is constitutionally justifiable under
s. 1  of the Charter  for the very reason that the detention is of
such very brief duration.

 

24               R. v. Grant, supra,
considered the meaning of ""forthwith"" in s. 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code .  In that case, an RCMP officer stopped a driver whom he suspected of
being impaired and made a demand for a breath sample.  He did not have the
ALERT screening device with him and had to wait 30 minutes for one to be
delivered before he could administer the test.  It was held that such a delay
fell outside the ambit of s. 254(2)  because the test was not administered
""forthwith"".  It was determined that ""forthwith"" meant ""immediately"". 
At page 150 the following appears in the reasons of the Court written by Lamer
C.J.:

 

                   In
my opinion, the actions of the officer in this case fell outside of the ambit
of s. 238(2) [now s. 254(2) ].  The demand made was not the demand
authorized by s. 238(2), that Mr. Grant provide a sample of his breath
""forthwith"". . . . The context of s. 238(2) indicates
no basis for departing from the ordinary, dictionary meaning of the word
""forthwith"" which suggests that the breath sample is to be provided
immediately.

 

25               In order to determine whether
there is any reason to depart from the ordinary meaning to be given to
""forthwith"" it is necessary to consider a number of factors.  First,
would a 15‑minute delay prior to administering an ALERT test be
consistent with the Charter ?  Second, who would be affected by an
enlarged definition of ""forthwith""?  Third, should the manner in
which the ALERT tests are conducted be uniform or should different
interpretations of ""forthwith"" apply in different circumstances?

 

                   1.The Meaning to Be Given
to ""Forthwith"" in Light of Section 10 (b) of the Charter 

 

26               Since R. v. Thomsen, supra,
this Court has repeatedly held that if a driver is stopped by a police officer,
that driver is detained for the purposes of s. 10 (b) of the Charter . 
The driver, accordingly, has the right to retain and instruct counsel.  See,
for example, R. v. Deruelle, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 663, at p. 676; R.
v. Grant, supra, at pp. 149-50; R. v. Schmautz, [1990] 1
S.C.R. 398, at pp. 409 ff.  In R. v. Thomsen it was recognized that
although the absence of the opportunity to retain counsel violated s. 10 (b)
of the Charter , it was justified under s. 1  because it was urgent
that the breath sample be obtained quickly in order to be effective.  The right
to retain counsel was incompatible both with the effective use of the ALERT
device and with the purpose of demonstrating a police presence which would
convince drinking drivers that there was a high probability that they would be
quickly and readily detected.  The section's use of the word
""forthwith"" in the context of a roadside screening test clearly
indicated that there was to be no opportunity granted to a driver to call a
lawyer.  The test was to be performed immediately and to fail it had no penal
consequences.  It is a testing device used to protect the public.

 

27               Although s. 234.1 which was
considered in Thomsen has been slightly amended it remains virtually
identical to the present s. 254(2) .  The present section, rather than
referring to an ""approved roadside"" screening test, refers to an
""approved"" screening test and it is applicable not only to motor
vehicles but also to aircraft, boats and railways.  Obviously the word
""roadside"" can no longer describe the location of either the vehicles
or the testing device.  However, the Thomsen interpretation of
""forthwith"" is certainly not affected by these amendments.  The
section still anticipates that the test will be administered quickly at the
point at which the driver or operator is detained wherever that vehicle may be
operated.

 

28               Counsel for the respondent not
only argued that there should be a 15‑ to 20‑minute waiting period
before the ALERT test was administered but also that, during the waiting
period, the police officer should indicate that the driver had the right to
consult counsel.  This submission demonstrates the weakness of the argument. 
Quite simply, it is not possible to conduct a roadside test
""forthwith"", that is immediately, and at the same time require the
driver to be subject to a detention which is sufficiently lengthy to provide an
opportunity to retain and instruct counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter . 
A delay of that length without the right to instruct counsel might well not
only be inconsistent with s. 10 (b) of the Charter  but also
be such that it could not be saved by s. 1 .  This is not to say that if,
in the past, a police constable has waited to ensure an accurate ALERT test
reading that this will invalidate or render inadmissible the test results.  The
respondent's position, if adopted, would create unnecessary conflicts.

 

29               Where a statute is open to more
than one interpretation, one of which is constitutional and the other of which
is not, the interpretation which is consistent with the constitution should be
adopted.  See Severn v. The Queen (1878), 2 S.C.R. 70, at p. 103; McKay
v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 798, at pp. 803‑4.  In my view, to
interpret ""forthwith"" as meaning ""immediately"" is
consistent with the Charter  and should therefore be adopted.  This
conclusion is supported by the very nature of the ALERT test which is designed
to be no more than a preliminary screening device.  As such it should be
administered immediately both for the protection of other users of the road and
for the convenience of drivers who have nothing to fear from taking such a
test.  Support for this position can be garnered from a consideration of those
relatively rare circumstances when immediate ALERT testing might lead to
inaccurate results.

 

                   2.What Test Results Would
In Fact Be Affected by Residual Mouth Alcohol?

 

30               The respondent does not suggest
that there is a problem with the ALERT testing device itself.  Nor is it argued
that a 15‑minute delay would be required prior to administering every
ALERT test.  Rather, it is submitted that the purpose of the postponement is to
allow residual mouth alcohol to dissipate prior to the test.  The evidence
indicated that residual alcohol remains in a person's mouth for 15 to 20
minutes after the last drink is consumed or if there is burping or
regurgitation.  It is accepted that all mouth alcohol dissipates in a period of
15 to 20 minutes.

 

31               It can be seen that the 15‑minute
postponement would only be necessary to accommodate drinkers with indigestion
or, more frequently, those who see fit to take a drink shortly before driving
their car.  It seems to me entirely reasonable that the driver who does take a
drink in those circumstances should be prepared to accept the consequences. 
The ALERT test serves as a screening device which can indicate those drivers
who may have consumed more alcohol than is permitted.  As such, it can confirm
that an officer has the requisite grounds to require a driver who fails the
test to take the breathalyzer test.

 

32               If, as a consequence of taking a
drink shortly before driving, there is in fact an unusually high level of
residual mouth alcohol, the results of the false ALERT reading will be
rectified by the breathalyzer test which requires a 15‑minute observation
period before it is performed.  Any inconvenience arising from the requirement
that a breathalyzer test be taken results from the driver's action of taking
the alcohol so close to the time he started to drive.  An impaired driver is a
potentially lethal hazard that must be detected and removed from the road as
quickly as possible.  The ability to administer the test immediately helps to
protect the public by detecting those who may be a danger.  The relatively rare
occasions on which an ALERT test may be erroneous as a result of the driver
consuming a very recent drink must be tolerated in the interest of the safety
of the public.

 

33               This requirement to undergo the
ALERT testing immediately should be regarded as one of the obligations that
flows from the right to drive.  In Galaske v. O'Donnell, [1994] 1 S.C.R.
670, at p. 686, it was noted that the driving of a motor vehicle is
neither a God-given nor a constitutional right.  Rather, it is a privilege
granted by licence.  Attached to every right are concomitant duties,
obligations and responsibilities.  This is true of the licensed right to
drive.  One of the prime responsibilities of a driver is to see that reasonable
care is exercised in the operation of the motor vehicle, and specifically, that
it is driven in a manner which does not endanger members of the public.  That
duty or responsibility cannot be fulfilled by an impaired driver who, by
definition, endangers others.  In furtherance of the duty not to endanger
others, there exists an obligation to comply with a police officer's reasonable
request to supply a breath sample.  Complying with a reasonable request to take
an ALERT test is a very small price to pay for the privilege of driving.

 

                   3.Uniformity of ALERT Test
Procedures

 

34               In R. v. Pierman; R. v.
Dewald (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 704 (C.A.), it was held that police officers
should adopt a flexible approach to s. 254(2) .  It was stated that, as a
general rule, a police officer must not delay the taking of a sample for an
ALERT test and that the demand and testing should occur immediately.  This, it
was said, was necessary in order for the section to comply with the Charter . 
However, it was also held that where a police officer is of the opinion that a
breath sample will be contaminated because of the presence of mouth alcohol,
the police officer may postpone the making of the demand for breath or may
postpone the administration of the test for 15 minutes in order to allow the
mouth alcohol to dissipate.  It was recognized that there is a certain
inconsistency which flows from this flexible approach.  It was put in this way
at p. 711:

 

                   If
. . . we were to hold that a police officer is entitled to wait 15
minutes before taking a breath sample pursuant to s. 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code , solely on the hypothesis that the suspect may have consumed alcohol
within the previous 15 minutes, we would be, in my view, unduly expanding the
statutory basis upon which motorists may be detained without access to
counsel.  It would have been open for Parliament to provide a time frame within
which s. 254(2)  should operate, as it did, for instance, in s. 258(1) (c)(ii)
[with respect to breathalyzer tests].  In my opinion, it is not open to this
court to expand the scope of a Charter  infringement beyond what is
necessary to give effect to the section.

 

35               I cannot agree that the
`flexibility' approach should be adopted.  First, the wording of the Code
indicates that a 15‑minute delay is not contemplated by the two-stage
screening and testing procedure set out in s. 254(2)  and (3) .  The whole
scheme anticipates a very brief detention and immediate application of the
screening test.  As well, a delay of 15 minutes would be inconsistent with the
conclusion reached in R. v. Thomsen, supra, and it might not be
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  It can never be forgotten
that there is no criminal liability which attaches to an ALERT test failure. 
At the most, that failure will result in the administration of a more accurate
breathalyzer test, when any false reading resulting from residual mouth alcohol
will be corrected.  All these factors taken together indicate that it is
preferable to impose a uniform standard for the meaning of
""forthwith"".  It follows that the demand for an ALERT test must be
made immediately in every situation when a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in
the body has been established.

 

36               The facts of this case emphasize
the importance of immediate testing and clearly show that the ALERT test can
accurately indicate a driver's impairment.  The respondent failed the ALERT
test.  On his two subsequent breathalyzer tests, he registered blood alcohol
levels of 230 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and
210 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood.  Both these results are
between two and three times the legal limit.  The respondent did in fact pose a
very real danger to the public.  I can see no valid reason for changing the
uniform interpretation of s. 254(2)  to accommodate those who risk failing
an ALERT test by taking a drink immediately before they drive their cars.

 

Reasonable and
Probable Grounds

 

37               The respondent contended that a
fail result on the ALERT test could not establish the reasonable and probable
grounds necessary to make the breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3)  of the Criminal
Code .  This, it was said, flows from the knowledge that police officers
have or should have that the ALERT test may be inaccurate due to the presence
of residual mouth alcohol.  Constable Mashford testified:  ""Upon having
the -- reading of fail registered on [the ALERT] I, at that point, formed the
opinion that Mr. Bernshaw's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by
alcohol"".  Yet, he had observed other symptoms of impairment upon which he
could very properly have based his conclusion that he had reasonable and
probable grounds for making the demand.  He had seen the respondent driving
erratically, he smelled alcohol on his breath and noted that his eyes were red
and glassy.  In addition, the respondent had admitted that he had been
drinking.  I would have thought that those symptoms, in themselves, would have
constituted reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand.

 

38               The constable, in a commendable
manner, wished to have his observations and suspicions confirmed by the ALERT
test.  It was not unreasonable for him to take this position.  However, I would
observe that to satisfy himself that he had the reasonable and probable grounds
required by s. 253(3) in this case, as well as in many other similar
situations, the observations of the officer as to signs of impairment may well
be sufficient, in themselves, to form the basis for the reasonable and probable
grounds required to make the breathalyzer demand.  Further, if an officer has a
reasonable suspicion, based on observation or reliable information that the
driver has alcohol in his body, and as a result requires an ALERT test to be
taken, then a fail result, in and of itself, may be sufficient to raise the
officer's suspicions to the reasonable and probable grounds required to make a
breathalyzer demand.  In other words, once a police officer has, in fact, a
reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body, the use of the ALERT test is
warranted and the officer may rely on the results of that test in order to make
a breathalyzer demand.  The mere possibility that the ALERT test might have
been inaccurate because of alcohol consumed shortly before driving and within
the 15 minutes prior to the test is insufficient to invalidate the reasonableness
of the officer's belief based on the result of the test.

 

Current Applicability
of Rilling v. The Queen

 

39               In this case, the police officer
undoubtedly had reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer
demand.  It is therefore not strictly necessary to consider the applicability
of Rilling v. The Queen, supra.  Yet, both parties addressed this
issue and there seems to be a difference of opinion on the question among the
Courts of Appeal.  In Rilling, it was held that the lack of reasonable
and probable grounds for making the demand was irrelevant in those situations
where the driver had, in any event, acceded to the request.  This Court adopted
the position of the Court of Appeal, which was put in this way, at p. 198:

 

                   It
is my opinion that this Court should accept and adopt the views expressed in
the Orchard, Showell and Flegel cases, supra, and hold
that while absence of reasonable and probable grounds for belief of impairment
may afford a defence to a charge of refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test
laid under subs. (2) of s. 235 of the Code, it does not render
inadmissible certificate evidence in the case of a charge under s. 236 of
the Code.  The motive which actuates a peace officer in making a demand under
s. 235(1) is not a relevant consideration when the demand has been acceded
to.

 

40               The British Columbia Court of
Appeal in this case held that Rilling was no longer good law since it
was decided prior to the Charter .

 

41               In my view, the Court of Appeal
erred in taking this position.  Certainly the Charter  is relevant.  An
accused may be able to establish on the balance of probabilities that the
taking of breath samples infringed his Charter  rights.  For example, it
might be contended that the requisite reasonable and probable grounds for
making the breathalyzer demand were absent, and that, in the circumstances, the
admission of those breathalyzer results would bring the administration of
justice into disrepute.  In those circumstances, the breathalyzer evidence
might well not be accepted.  Yet, where an accused complies with the breathalyzer
demand, the Crown need not prove as part of its case that it had reasonable and
probable grounds to make that demand.  Rather, I think, the onus rests upon the
accused to establish on the balance of probabilities that there has been a Charter 
breach and that, under s. 24(2) , the evidence should be excluded.  There
should not be an automatic exclusion of the breathalyzer test results.

 

42               Several provincial appellate
courts have taken the position that the Rilling case is still applicable
in appropriate circumstances.  That is to say where breath samples are obtained
without reasonable and probable grounds for the demand, the evidence should
only be excluded upon an application by the accused to exclude it pursuant to
s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  See R. v. McNulty (1991), 35
M.V.R. (2d) 27 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Linttell (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 507
(Alta. C.A.); R. v. Dwernychuk (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Alta. C.A.),
leave to appeal refused, [1993] 2 S.C.R. vii; R. v. Marshall (1989), 91
N.S.R. (2d) 211 (C.A.); R. v. Langdon (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 570 (Nfld.
C.A.); R. v. Leneal (1990), 68 Man. R. (2d) 127 (C.A.).  This, I think,
is the approach that should be adopted.

 

Summary

 

43               In my view, the word
""forthwith"" in s. 254(2)  means ""immediately"".  Police
officers must make a demand for an ALERT sample immediately upon forming a
reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body and they must administer the test immediately
upon making that demand for a breath sample.  Section 254(2)  does not
anticipate, require or include a 15‑minute delay to allow residual mouth
alcohol to dissipate either prior to making the demand or prior to
administering the test.  This conclusion flows from a consideration of the
gravity of the problem of drinking and driving; the system set out in the Criminal
Code  for screening and subsequently testing drivers for their alcohol
level; the protection of the public; the convenience of the motoring public who
can immediately continue on their way after successfully passing the ALERT
test; the interpretation of the section to comply with the Charter ; and
the nature of the risk involved in not proceeding immediately with the test.

 

Disposition

 

44               In the result, the appeal is
allowed, the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal is set aside, and
the conviction and sentence imposed at trial are restored.

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, Sopinka, McLachlin and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

45               Sopinka
J. -- I have read the reasons of Justice Cory and while I am in
agreement with my colleague that the appeal should be allowed, with respect, I
cannot agree with the reasons by which he arrived at the result.  In the
circumstances of the present appeal, I agree that the police officer had
reasonable and probable grounds to make a breathalyzer demand based on the
results of the screening test along with the other indicia of impairment. 
However, I am not prepared to hold that, as a matter of law, a ""fail""
result is sufficient to constitute reasonable and probable grounds, per se,
where a police officer is aware of circumstances that make the results of the
test unreliable.

 

46               In the case at bar there is no
evidence that such circumstances were present.  There was no evidence
concerning the time when the respondent consumed his last drink of alcohol nor
was there any evidence of other circumstances which would render the results of
the test unreliable.  The officer was entitled to rely on the results of the
test in support of his opinion that reasonable and probable grounds existed on
which to base a demand for a breathalyzer test.  The decision as to whether a
peace officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that an offence is
being committed and, therefore, that a demand is authorized under
s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , must be
based on the circumstances of the case.  It is, therefore, essentially a
question of fact and not one of pure law.

 

I.Relevant
Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code 

 

                   254.     ...

 

                   (2)
Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is operating a
motor vehicle or vessel or operating or assisting in the operation of an
aircraft or of railway equipment or who has the care or control of a motor
vehicle, vessel or aircraft or of railway equipment, whether it is in motion or
not, has alcohol in the person's body, the peace officer may, by demand made to
that person, require the person to provide forthwith such a sample of breath as
in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of
the breath to be made by means of an approved screening device and, where
necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a
sample of breath to be taken.

 

                   (3)
Where a peace officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a person
is committing, or at any time within the preceding two hours has committed, as
a result of the consumption of alcohol, an offence under section 253 , the peace
officer may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as practicable,
require that person to provide then or as soon thereafter as is practicable

 

(a)               such
samples of the person's breath as in the opinion of a qualified
technician. . .

 

                                                                    ...

 

are
necessary to enable proper analysis to be made in order to determine the
concentration, if any, of alcohol in the person's blood, and to accompany the
peace officer for the purpose of enabling such samples to be taken.

 

II.Issues

 

47               The following issues are raised
for consideration:

 

1.Did
the Court of Appeal err in law by ruling that unless a peace officer either
ascertains when a driver consumed his last drink of alcohol or waits at least
15 minutes before administering an approved screening device test, one cannot
rely on a ""fail"" reading on the approved screening device test in
making a breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

2.What
is the proper interpretation of ""forthwith"" in s. 254(2)  of the Criminal
Code ?  Specifically, is it appropriate to read into the meaning of
""forthwith"" a requirement that a peace officer either ascertain when
a subject consumed his last drink of alcohol or wait for a period of 15 minutes
before administering an approved screening device test?

 

III.Analysis

 

A.Does
a ""fail"" result per se furnish reasonable and probable grounds to
demand a breathalyzer?

 

48               The Criminal Code  provides
that where a police officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a
person has committed an offence pursuant to s. 253 of the Code, the
police officer may demand a breathalyzer.  The existence of reasonable and
probable grounds entails both an objective and a subjective component.  That
is, s. 254(3) of the Code requires that the police officer subjectively
have an honest belief that the suspect has committed the offence and
objectively there must exist reasonable grounds for this belief:  R. v.
Callaghan, [1974] 3 W.W.R. 70 (Sask. Dist. Ct.); R. v. Belnavis,
[1993] O.J. No. 637 (Gen. Div.) (QL); R. v. Richard (1993), 12 O.R. (3d)
260 (Prov. Div.); and see also R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241,
regarding the requirements for reasonable and probable grounds in the context
of an arrest.

 

49               It is clear that Parliament has
set up a statutory scheme whereby a screening test can be administered by the
police merely upon entertaining a reasonable suspicion that alcohol is in a
person's body.  The purpose behind this screening test is evidently to assist
police in furnishing the reasonable grounds necessary to demand a
breathalyzer.  The roadside screening test is a convenient tool for confirming
or rejecting a suspicion regarding the commission of an alcohol-related driving
offence under s. 253 of the Code.  A ""fail"" result may be
considered, along with any other indicia of impairment, in order to provide the
police officer with the necessary reasonable and probable grounds to demand a
breathalyzer.  Normally, where a properly conducted roadside screening test
yields a ""fail"" result, this alone will be sufficient to furnish a
police officer with such grounds. 

 

50               Nonetheless, as I stated at the
outset, it cannot be said that a ""fail"" result per se provides
reasonable and probable grounds.  If that were the case, it was open to
Parliament to indicate this intention in the Criminal Code .  Yet,
nowhere in s. 254  is it indicated that a ""fail"" result on an approved
screening device is deemed to provide reasonable and probable grounds.  Thus,
it is necessary to determine as a question of fact in each case whether or not
the police officer had an honest belief based on reasonable and probable grounds
that the suspect had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Code.

 

51               Where there is evidence that the
police officer knew that the suspect had recently consumed alcohol and expert
evidence shows that the subsequent screening test would be unreliable due to
the presence of alcohol in the mouth, it cannot be decreed, as a matter of law,
that both the subjective and objective tests have been satisfied.  To so hold
would fly in the face of the evidence.  What if the officer testifies that he
did not believe that the ALERT reading provided the necessary grounds?  Is his
or her evidence to be ignored?  The requirement in s. 254(3)  that
reasonable and probable grounds exist is not only a statutory but a
constitutional requirement as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure
under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Section
8  requires that reasonable and probable grounds exist in fact and not
that their presence can be deemed to exist notwithstanding the evidence.

 

52               With respect, I cannot accept my
colleague's suggestion that the interests of preventing drunk driving and the
fact that it will be only rarely that circumstances arise whereby the screening
test will yield false results justify any ""inconvenience arising from the
requirement that a breathalyzer test be taken"" (p. 276).  Those
instances, even if they are rare (about which there is no evidence in this
case), constitute violations of s. 8  of the Charter .  I am unaware of any
principle of statutory interpretation which sanctions breaches of the Charter 
provided such breaches are rare.

 

53               Nor do I find much consolation in
the observation that someone who has consumed alcohol immediately prior to
driving must bear the risk of a ""false fail"" result on the screening
device.  Is such a person somehow entitled to less protection than another who
waits 15 minutes?  Moreover, taking a drink within the 15-minute period is not
the only circumstance which renders the test unreliable.  According to the RCMP
training course manual, the result is also distorted by a burp or a belch.  In
each case a waiting period of about 15 minutes is recommended.  Should all
these cases be lumped together to bear the consequences of a ""false
fail"" reading?  These individuals, as much as any others, are entitled to
the protection of s. 8  of the Charter .  The fact that a subsequent
breathalyzer result may rectify the inaccurate ""fail"" obtained by a
faulty screening test is no solace to an individual whose Charter  rights
have been violated.  This is not just a matter of inconvenience to the
individual.  The existence of reasonable and probable grounds is essential to
protect the privacy rights of anyone who might be subjected to a search and
seizure by the police.  

 

54               In R. v. Richardson, Ont.
Prov. Div., October 31, 1990, unreported, Sharpe Prov. Div. J. held
that an officer who was trained in the use of screening devices and who failed
to wait 15 minutes prior to administering the test did not have reasonable and
probable grounds to demand a breathalyzer.  The reasoning of Sharpe Prov. Div.
J. emphasizes that an unreliable test cannot form the necessary legal
foundation for a subsequent breathalyzer demand:

 

                   Even
when the machine is calibrated properly [the reading may be] unreliable if the
proper waiting time is not adhered to; this could result [in] a reading that
was either too high or too low.  An improper taking of the test with a
resulting variable reading cannot in the opinion of the court, form either
reasonable or probable grounds for the making of a Demand under Section 254(3) 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada.  [Emphasis added.]

 

It must be noted that in Richardson,
unlike in the case at bar, there was evidence to the effect that the accused
had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the test.

 

55               It is important to understand the
frailties associated with the roadside screening tests and the potential
unreliability which may result from the presence of mouth alcohol.  The
manufacturer of the alcohol screening device used in the present case recognizes
that when certain circumstances prevail, the results will not be accurate.  The
following extract from the manufacturer's manual concerning the effects of
mouth alcohol is pertinent:

 

The
concentration of alcohol in a drink is much higher than would ever be present
in the blood so that, if a breath sample were analysed soon after the
subject had consumed his or her last drink, the reading would be very high due
to residual alcohol remaining in the mouth.  Some of this mouth alcohol
would evaporate into the expired air but this breath alcohol reading would not
reflect the true blood alcohol concentration.

 

It
is important therefore that a period of at least twenty minutes has elapsed
since the subject had his or her last drink.  This twenty minute period allows
for any mouth alcohol to be dispersed, so that a valid breath alcohol analysis
can be carried out to determine the blood alcohol concentration.

 

Similarly,
if the subject has recently regurgitated or vomited, after a recent drink, this
too could introduce alcohol into the mouth and so affect the result of a
subsequent breath test.  [Emphasis added.]

 

56               It is also relevant to note the
statements in the manual of the training course given by the RCMP with respect
to the operation of the screening devices and the unreliability caused by the
presence of mouth alcohol:

 

All
deep lung breath samples originate in the lower part of the lungs, pass through
the windpipe and the mouth before entering the S-L2.  Any residual alcohol
present in the mouth during this time will contaminate the breath sample.  The
raw alcohol, because of its high concentration, saturates the breath sample and
produces false high results on the S-L2.  As an example, a FAIL may be
indicated on the S-L2 when the correct result is actually a WARN or PASS.

 

Raw
alcohol can be present in the mouth as a result of the recent consumption of
alcoholic beverages or if a belch or burp were to bring up alcohol from the
stomach.  This residual alcohol will disappear quite rapidly, generally taking
fifteen (15) minutes or less to dissipate.

 

As
a result, the total time from your initial observation of the person at the
vehicle until the time the person blows into the S-L2 should not be less than
fifteen (15) minutes.  This practice will minimize the possibility that mouth
alcohol will affect the S-L2 test.  [Emphasis added.]

 

57               Although the RCMP training
suggests a waiting period of not less than 15 minutes whereas the manufacturer
recommends waiting 20 minutes, the basic concern is the same.  In order to
ensure that the results of the test are not falsely elevated, one must wait an
adequate period of time so that any mouth alcohol present has had an
opportunity to dissipate.

 

58               In the present case, the adverse
effect of mouth alcohol on the results of the screening test, as illustrated by
the above passages, was confirmed by the expert evidence of Mr. Wong.  He
testified that, when administering a breathalyzer or a screening device, as a
precaution ""[t]he technician is to ensure that the subject has not
consumed any alcohol at least twenty minutes prior to taking a first
sample"".  The reason for the precaution, according to Mr. Wong, was that
""if there's any mouth alcohol, that will falsely elevate the result on the
Alcolmeter SL/2 and give a false result"".  That is, the blood-alcohol
level reading would be falsely elevated.

 

59               If the scientific evidence
establishes a high degree of unreliability with respect to the screening device
when certain conditions prevail, and if a police officer knows, for example
based on his or her training, that the resultant screening device will provide
inaccurate results where a suspect has consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes
prior to administering the test, how can the police officer testify that he or
she had an honest belief of impairment, absent other indicia?  Surely the
knowledge that the screening test is unreliable would vitiate any subjective
belief that an officer may have regarding reasonable and probable grounds of
the commission of an offence under s. 253 of the Code.  A police officer
will have difficulty in concluding that such a flawed test upgrades one's mere
suspicion into reasonable and probable grounds.  If the police officer is to
give an honest answer as to his belief, I cannot see how, as a matter of law,
we can tell the officer that the answer is wrong.

 

60               This, of course, is assuming that
the results of the screening test are the sole basis for raising a police
officer's mere suspicion to full reasonable grounds to demand a breathalyzer
under s. 253(3) of the Code.  If other symptoms or indicia are present
which are sufficient to provide reasonable and probable grounds, then the
officer need not rely solely on a faulty screening device test and the above
problem would not necessarily arise.  As I indicated earlier, each case must be
assessed on its facts.  However, a ""fail"" result per se is
insufficient to furnish reasonable and probable grounds where circumstances
exist as discussed above, such that the police know that the test would yield
faulty results.

 

B.The
interpretation of ""forthwith"":  Must the screening test be
administered immediately?

 

61               The possibility that a police
officer may not be able to rely on a screening device result which is known to
be unreliable if it is administered within 15 minutes of the last drink
consumed by the suspect raises concerns regarding the requirement of s. 254(2)
of the Code that the suspect provide a breath sample forthwith.  The
problem arises if ""forthwith"" is interpreted to mean that the
roadside test must be administered immediately and that there is no authority
to delay 15 minutes in order to ensure the accuracy of the test results.  As
was noted by Fairgieve Prov. Div. J. in R. v. Richard, supra, if
this were the situation then police officers would be faced with the dilemma
whereby the test might be invalidated as unreliable if administered without
delay, yet would also be invalidated as an unauthorized test under s. 254(2)  if
the police officer did wait 15 minutes.  This would appear to create an
intolerable situation as it would emasculate the statutory scheme in
circumstances where the police officer knows the suspect has very recently
consumed his or her last drink of liquor.  In my view, this could not have been
the intention of Parliament.

 

62               This Court has twice before considered
the meaning of ""forthwith"" in the context of the statutory scheme in
question.  In R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, this Court had the
opportunity to consider the meaning of ""forthwith"" in s. 234.1(1),
the predecessor to s. 254(2) of the Code.  Section 234.1 was worded
slightly differently as it applied only to persons driving a motor vehicle and
the provision referred to the use of a ""roadside"" screening device. 
In the current provision, there is no reference to ""roadside"" and s.
254(2)  applies equally to vessels, aircraft and railway equipment.  However,
like my colleague Cory J., I do not believe that anything turns on the
difference between the provisions.  In my view, the characterization of the
screening device as ""roadside"" is merely indicative of the fact that,
in the old provision, Parliament did not include the possibility that the test
could be administered to detect the impaired operation of other vehicles such
as aircraft or railway equipment.  Section 254(2) , however, specifically mentions
these forms of transportation and so the test is not necessarily conducted
""roadside"".  This does not, however, change the meaning to be given
to ""forthwith"".

 

63               In Thomsen, it was
determined that the roadside demand for a breath sample violated s. 10 (b)
of the Charter ; however, the provision was saved by s. 1 .  In the course
of his reasons, Le Dain J. addressed the meaning of ""forthwith"" at p.
651:

 

In
our reasons for judgment in Therens, both Estey J. and I, in comparing
s. 234.1(1) [now s. 254(2) ] and s. 235(1), also attached importance to the fact
that Parliament chose to use the word ""forthwith"" without
qualification in s. 234.1(1) but the words ""forthwith or as soon as
practicable"" and ""then or as soon thereafter as is practicable""
in s. 235(1).

 

And later, at p. 653:

 

                   These
observations emphasize what, as a practical matter, is implied by the words
""forthwith"" and ""roadside"" in s. 234.1(1).  That there is
to be no opportunity for contact with counsel prior to compliance with a s.
234.1(1) demand is, in my opinion, an implication of the terms of s. 234.1(1)
when viewed in the context of the breath testing provisions of the Criminal
Code  as a whole.  A s. 234.1(1)  roadside screening device test is to be
administered at roadside, at such time and place as the motorist is stopped,
and as quickly as possible, having regard to the outside operating limit of two
hours for the breathalyzer test which it may be found to be necessary to
administer ....  [Emphasis added.]

 

64               Although the above passage states
that the screening test should be administered as soon as possible, the fact
that one should have regard to the two-hour limit for the breathalyzer test
suggests that a 15-minute delay would not offend the provision nor the scheme
of s. 254 of the Code.  Implicit in the requirement that the sample be
provided forthwith is any operational time component.  The peace officer has to
ready the equipment and instruct the suspect on what to do.  In short, the
statutory provisions must allow the time required to take a proper test.  The
duration of this time requirement is constrained by the fact that there is an
overall time limit of two hours if the scheme is to work.

 

65               In R. v. Grant, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 139, this Court considered the meaning of ""forthwith"" in
relation to essentially the identical provision as s. 254(2) of the Code. 
In that case the issue was whether waiting 30 minutes for the necessary
apparatus to be delivered fell outside the meaning of ""forthwith""
such that there was no authorized demand to submit to the screening device
test.  Lamer C.J., for the Court, held that the reasons in Thomsen were
directly applicable to the amended provision, s. 238(2) (now s. 254(2) ).  It
was concluded that the actions of the police officer fell outside the ambit of
s. 238(2) since the officer did not demand that the suspect provide a breath
sample forthwith.  In this regard, Lamer C.J. stated the following, at p. 150:

 

The
context of s. 238(2) indicates no basis for departing from the ordinary,
dictionary meaning of the word ""forthwith"" which suggests that the
breath sample is to be provided immediately.  Without delving into an
analysis of the exact number of minutes which may pass before the demand for a
breath sample falls outside of the term ""forthwith"", I would simply
observe that where, as here, the demand is made by a police officer who is
without an A.L.E.R.T. unit and the unit does not, in fact, arrive for a half
hour, the provisions of s. 238(2) will not be satisfied.  [Emphasis added].

 

66               The above passage seems to
indicate that the Grant case does not rule out the possibility that
there is in fact some leeway to administer the test after a certain period of
delay.  Lamer C.J. expressly declined to decide the exact length of time before
which the demand could be said to fall outside the term ""forthwith"". 
In Grant, however, a half-hour delay in circumstances where no screening
device was even at the scene fell outside the ambit of the Criminal Code .

 

67               A number of cases decided both
prior to Grant as well as subsequently have held that ""forthwith""
does not mean immediately.  In R. v. Seo (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 293
(C.A.), it was held that the test could be administered as soon as reasonably
possible in the circumstances.  Finlayson J.A. noted that ""forthwith""
is defined in Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law as well as in Black's Law
Dictionary to mean within a reasonable time having regard to the provision and
the circumstances of the case.

 

68               In R. v. Wonnacott (1990),
23 M.V.R. (2d) 248 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), aff'd (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 300 (C.A.), the
police waited nine minutes prior to giving the test due to recent consumption
of alcohol.  McDermid J. held that waiting in order to ensure the accuracy of
the screening test was still within the meaning of forthwith.  At page 251, it
was stated that ""[t]oo narrow an interpretation of the word
""forthwith"" in s. 254 will thwart the intention of the
Legislature"".  Thus, where the police act in good faith, delays of this
type should not be a basis for rejecting the results of the screening device.

 

69               Similarly, in R. v. Kaczmarek
(1994), 16 O.R. (3d) 510 (Gen. Div.) the police waited 11 minutes before
administering the test because the accused had been smoking which could also
adversely affect the test results.  Hayes J. cited Grant as well as Wonnacott
and held that the delay of 11 minutes was within the meaning of
""forthwith"" in s. 254(2) of the Code.

 

70               Accordingly, it appears that
courts are willing to give a broad interpretation to the meaning of
""forthwith"" as set out in the Grant decision.  In my view this
is appropriate given the wording and context of the legislation.  The relevant
portion of s. 254(2) of the Code reads as follows:

 

...
the peace officer may, by demand made to that person, require the person to
provide forthwith such a sample of breath as in the opinion of the peace
officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of the breath to be made by
means of an approved screening device and, where necessary, to accompany
the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a sample of breath to be
taken.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The provision specifically
contemplates that the police officer is entitled to demand a breath sample
which enables a proper analysis of the breath.  In the situation where the
officer knows that a suspect has just recently consumed alcohol, a proper sample
can only be attained by waiting at least 15 minutes.  Thus, the wording of the
provision adds support to the argument that ""forthwith"" must be given
a flexible interpretation.

 

71               This conclusion is also supported
by two recent cases from the Ontario Court of Appeal.  In R. v. Pierman; R.
v. Dewald (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 704, the court considered whether police
officers are entitled to wait 15 minutes prior to taking a breath sample under
s. 254(2) of the Code in order to ensure proper functioning of the
machine.  After reviewing the jurisprudence, Arbour J.A. stated that whether or
not one can delay 15 minutes cannot be determined in the abstract.  If the
police could never wait 15 minutes, then the officer would be faced with the
choice of disregarding the ""fail"" result due to the suspicion of its
unreliability, or taking the suspect for a breathalyzer test and overlooking
the concern that the screening result may have been falsely high.  On the other
hand, Arbour J.A. noted that if the officer is entitled to wait 15 minutes
before administering the test, this unduly expands the detention without access
to counsel.  Arbour J.A. concluded as follows at p. 711:

 

                   In
my view, a police officer cannot delay the taking of a breath sample, when
acting pursuant to s. 254(2)  of the Criminal Code , unless he or she
is of the opinion that a breath sample provided immediately will not allow for
a proper analysis of the breath to be made by an approved screening device. 
The officer is not required to take a sample that she or he believes is not
suitable for a proper analysis.  The expression ""proper analysis""
incorporates an element of accuracy.... If there are facts which cause the
officer to form the opinion that a short delay is required in order to obtain
an accurate result, I think that the officer is acting within the scope of the
section in delaying the taking of the breath sample.  In such a case, as I
indicated earlier, I do not think that it matters whether the officer postpones
making the demand or postpones administering the test after having made the
demand.  [Emphasis added.]

 

72               Therefore, because in that case
there was evidence that Pierman might have consumed alcohol just prior to being
stopped by the police, it was legitimate to delay the test.  Whereas, in
Dewald's case, the police had no information as to when the accused last
consumed alcohol and so delaying the test was not justifiable.  Arbour J.A.
held that the police can only detain a suspect for an extra 15 minutes where
there is some factual basis upon which to suspect that the screening device
would yield an inaccurate result.

 

73               I adopt the flexible approach
taken by Arbour J.A.  In my view, it is in accord with the purpose of the
statutory scheme and ensures that a police officer has an honest belief based
on reasonable and probable grounds prior to making a breathalyzer demand. 
Waiting 15 minutes is permitted under s. 254(2) of the Code when this is
in accordance with the exigencies of the use of the equipment.  This applies
when an officer is aware of the potential inaccuracy in the particular case.

 

74               Although there is no doubt that
the screening test should generally be administered as quickly as possible, it
would entirely defeat the purpose of Parliament to require the police to
administer the screening test immediately in circumstances where the results
would be rendered totally unreliable and flawed.  The flexible approach strikes
the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of
drinking and driving, on the one hand, and the rights of citizens to be free
from unreasonable search and seizure.  I do not believe that the matter is
advanced by quoting statistics.  Although we all agree that Parliament has
every reason to vigorously pursue the objective of reducing the carnage on our
highways, that objective is not advanced by subjecting innocent persons to
invasions of privacy on the basis of faulty tests.  I do not believe that this
is what Parliament intended in enacting s. 254  of the Criminal Code .

 

75               I note that a potential problem
which may arise from delaying the screening test, and which was discussed by my
colleague in his reasons as well as by Arbour J.A., is whether the suspect is
entitled to access to counsel when detained for a longer period.  In the Thomsen
case, it was held that the roadside screening procedure was a reasonable limit
on one's right to counsel under s. 10 (b) of the Charter .  In my
view, a delay in the order of 15 minutes in order to obtain a proper sample of
breath is not inconsistent with Thomsen.  It would indeed be strange for
us to hold that the rights of some persons under one provision of the Charter 
(s. 8 ) must be sacrificed in order to preserve the limit on their rights
under another provision (s. 10 (b)).

 

C.Application
to the facts of this case

 

76               In light of the above analysis, it
is necessary to determine whether, on the facts of this particular case, the
police officer had an honest belief on reasonable and probable grounds that the
respondent had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Code notwithstanding
the potential unreliability of the screening device.

 

77               As my colleague Cory J. noted,
several other potential indicia of impairment were present in this case aside
from the evidence provided by the screening test.  Constable Mashford testified
that he noticed a vehicle exceeding the speed limit and drifting, on two
occasions, from the shoulder of the road to the centre and back with the brake
lights flickering on and off.  As well, upon questioning the respondent, a
smell of liquor was detected and the respondent admitted that he had been
drinking.  Furthermore, Constable Mashford also noticed that the respondent's
eyes were extremely red and glassy.  Based on the foregoing, arguably the
police officer could have had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a
breathalyzer even absent any screening device test results.  In that case, the
potential unreliability of the test results would not vitiate any belief based
on reasonable and probable grounds.

 

78               However, Constable Mashford
testified as follows:

 

Upon
having the -- the reading of fail registered on [the screening device] I, at
that point, formed the opinion that Mr. Bernshaw's ability to operate a
motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Thus, the evidence would appear to
indicate that, despite the other possible indicia of impairment, he did not
form a belief based on reasonable and probable grounds, which would authorize a
breathalyzer demand, until after administering the roadside screening test.  In
this regard, MacKenzie Prov. Ct. J. concluded the following:

 

It
was clear that Constable Mashford's suspicion that Mr. Bernshaw might be
impaired was raised to a belief that he had reasonable and probable grounds to
make a breathalyzer demand because of the failure on the ALERT device. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

79               For the purposes of my reasons, I will
assume that absent the ""fail"" result on the screening test, there
would not have been sufficient reasonable and probable grounds to demand a
breathalyzer.  Therefore, it must be determined if Constable Mashford was
entitled to rely on the ""fail"" result of the screening test.

 

80               In the present case, there is
absolutely no evidence with respect to the timing of the respondent's last
drink.  That is, it is unknown whether any alcohol was consumed within a period
of 15 minutes prior to the screening test.  The police officer made no inquiry
concerning how long it was prior to administering the screening test that the
respondent last consumed alcohol.  Without Constable Mashford having this
knowledge, it is too speculative to assert that the screening device result was
unreliable.  Where the particular screening device used has been approved under
the statutory scheme, the officer is entitled to rely on its accuracy unless
there is credible evidence to the contrary.

 

81               It was suggested by the respondent
that prior to demanding that a suspect submit a breath sample for the screening
test, the police officer ought to inquire when the suspect last consumed
alcohol in order to ensure an accurate test.  However, in my view, there is no
duty on the police to make any such inquiry.  A suspect is under no obligation
to answer such a question and thus it would be improper to impose such a duty
on the police.  That is not to say that the suspect may not volunteer such
information, either spontaneously or in response to a query of the police.  In
such a case, where the officer is told that the detainee has consumed liquor
within the last 15 minutes, or where other reasons exist for the officer to
believe that alcohol was recently present in the mouth of the suspect due to
regurgitation, the officer may wait an appropriate period of time prior to
administering the screening device.  However, the police are not required to
ascertain such information by posing the question to the suspect prior to
administering the screening device test.

 

82               That is not to say that the mere
fact the officer is told by the suspect that alcohol has recently been consumed
automatically requires the delay of the screening test.  A police officer is
entitled to disbelieve the suspect, in which case there will be no doubt in the
mind of the officer regarding the validity of the screening device results. 
However, if the officer believes the suspect, then in order to ensure an
accurate test, a delay will be justified.  It must be assumed that the police
officer will act bona fide in this regard. If he does not, the trial
judge is in a position to find that the officer lacked the necessary ground.

 

83               In other cases, the evidence
establishing the fact that the person has consumed a substance which will skew
the results is manifest and the officer will no doubt wait a period of time to
ensure that the screening test results are accurate.  For example, the officer
may have actually witnessed the suspect consume alcohol within the last 15
minutes.  See R. v. Jackson (1993), 147 A.R. 173 (Q.B.).

 

84               In the present case, Mr. Wong gave
evidence that the presence of mouth alcohol could distort the results of the roadside
test.  Expert evidence in the abstract is not helpful unless there is a link to
the facts of the particular case.  Even if the expert testifies that the
screening device would be wholly unreliable in the event that a suspect has had
alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the test, this evidence is meaningless
where there is no evidence that alcohol was in fact recently consumed. 
Therefore, at best, the expert evidence of Mr. Wong could only show that a
possibility existed that the screening device would be inaccurate.  This is not
sufficient to vitiate an honest belief based on reasonable and probable grounds
where the police officer did not believe that the test would be unreliable and
one could only speculate whether or not it would, in fact, have been
unreliable.

 

85               Illustrative of my conclusion on
the facts of this case is the decision in R. v. Linttell (1991), 64
C.C.C. (3d) 507 (Alta. C.A.), a case factually analogous to the one at bar. 
The police officer in that case failed to wait 15 minutes prior to
administering the roadside screening test in order to ensure that the presence
of mouth alcohol would not skew the results.  The court noted that there was no
evidence that the accused had any alcohol in his mouth nor that this was a
realistic possibility.  Doubt about contamination by mouth alcohol was mere
speculation and so there was no reason for the officer to have believed that
the test results may have been unreliable.  Therefore, the search was held to
be reasonable.  

 

86               Similarly, on the facts of this
case, I would conclude that Constable Mashford did have the necessary
reasonable and probable grounds to make a breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3)
of the Code.

 

IV.Disposition

 

87               In the result, I would also allow
the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction and sentence imposed at trial.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

88               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- With all due respect to my two colleagues, I do not find either of
their approaches to resolving the problem raised by the present appeal entirely
satisfactory.  On one hand, I cannot agree with Justice Cory that the ALERT
test should be administered immediately even under circumstances where it would
not be objectively reasonable to do so.  On the other hand, I cannot agree with
Justice Sopinka that we should adhere so purely to the subjective component of
reasonable and probable grounds that we should leave officers to judge
personally in every case whether a short hold-off period in administering the
ALERT test is warranted.  In my opinion, the correct approach to interpreting
the interaction of ss. 254(2)  and (3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , lies in between their proposed approaches.  I believe that there
is a practical middle ground which I encourage the police to follow as standard
procedure in the future, which will both simplify and clarify the administration
of the ALERT test.  

 

89               The interaction of ss. 254(2)  and
(3)  of the Criminal Code  presents, on its face, a conundrum.  On one
hand, s. 254(2)  requires that the ALERT test be administered
""forthwith"".  At the same time, s. 254(3)  stipulates that an officer
must believe on reasonable and probable grounds that an offence under s. 253 
has been committed in order to found a breathalyzer demand.  On the one hand, a
screening test that is not administered ""forthwith"" is not a proper
demand under s. 254(2) of the Code, and is therefore not a basis for
proceeding further against the motorist.  On the other hand, the respondent's
expert evidence suggests that there are instances in which administering the
screening test ""forthwith"" would render the test unreliable due to
the presence of mouth alcohol.  Following this conundrum through to its logical
conclusion, where a test is unreliable to the knowledge of the officer
administering it, then how can he or she rely upon it as the basis for the
reasonable and probable belief required by s. 254(3) ?  

 

90               In my view, it is entirely
conceivable, indeed likely, that Parliament did not at the time of passing this
legislation advert to the possibility that mouth alcohol could render a
roadside screening test manifestly unreliable.  It most likely assumed that
such a test could be administered forthwith and provide meaningful
results sufficient to give rise to the grounds necessary for a breathalyzer
demand.  The respondent's uncontradicted expert evidence suggests that the
assumption that the results are meaningful could very well be wrong in certain
circumstances.  Where the officer comes across such circumstances, he or she
may no longer be able to rely uniquely upon the screening test for the
reasonable and probable grounds required to make a breathalyzer demand.  An
interpretive Catch-22 therefore ensues.  Although it is quite manifest that
Parliament intended its approved screening devices to be capable of furnishing
the necessary reasonable and probable grounds to found a breathalyzer demand,
we are now faced with a situation in which one of the assumptions upon which
that scheme was founded may be demonstrably incorrect in certain
circumstances.  Given that the plain language of the provisions gives this
Court little guidance regarding Parliament's intention in such a situation, I
propose to address this problem by reference to, firstly, the spirit and
purpose of the legislation and, secondly, the underlying Charter  values
with which we must strive to remain consistent (Hills v. Canada (Attorney
General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513, at p. 558; Slaight Communications Inc. v.
Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078).

 

91               As I see it, Parliament intended
that its roadside screening test scheme principally address two important and
interrelated goals: (1) providing a convenient, expedient, and reasonably
objective basis upon which police may remove from the highway drivers that pose
a potential danger to others while (2) minimizing to the greatest extent
possible the unjustifiable inconvenience and detention of drivers.  On a
literal reading of the provisions in ss. 254(2) and (3) of the Code, we
cannot give full effect to one aspect of Parliament's purpose without
detracting from the other.  This Court must therefore determine, as a matter of
statutory interpretation, the manner in which ss. 254(2) and (3) of the Code
interact.  In so doing, it must find a way to reconcile the requirement that
the screening test be administered ""forthwith"" with the requirement
that a breathalyzer demand be based on ""reasonable and probable
grounds"" in a manner that is consistent with the particular context in
which these terms are used in the Code yet not inconsistent with Charter 
values.

 

92               I agree with my colleague Cory J.
that a 15-minute postponement of the ALERT test will generally only be
necessary in instances where drivers have seen fit to consume alcohol very
shortly before driving their car.  I agree, moreover, that any inconvenience
arising from the requirement to take a breathalyzer test following a fail on
the ALERT test is directly attributable to the driver's voluntary act of
consuming alcohol so close to the time of driving.  In the vast majority of
cases, therefore, the driver is, in effect, the author of his or her own
misfortune.  Finally, I appreciate the fact that the screening test is intended
to enable police to evaluate sobriety quickly, efficiently and reasonably
reliably in order to remove impaired drivers from the highways.  The screening
test is a quick heuristic, a rough and ready means to address, curtail and
deter a very real danger on the roads.  It is a screening device. 
Implicit in such a role is the acknowledgement that it is not perfect.  Partly
for this reason, its results carry no penal consequences.  In light of all of
these considerations, I agree with my colleague Cory J. that the purpose of the
ALERT scheme, the comparatively minor consequences of a false ""fail"",
and the pressing policy concerns underlying the need for uniformity, certainty
and efficiency in the administration of the scheme all militate toward
resolving this ambiguity in favour of administering the test in all cases without
significant delay.  I hesitate, however, to straitjacket police into having to
administer the test in situations where it would even be objectively
unreasonable to rely on the ALERT test results as the sole basis for
formulating a belief on reasonable and probable grounds.  I doubt, moreover,
that such an unbending interpretation of these two provisions is consistent
with the Charter .

 

93               Like both of my colleagues, I
adopt as my starting point the presumption that the ALERT test, a device
approved by Parliament, is, when properly administered to the knowledge of the
officer, itself sufficient grounds to found the belief on reasonable and
probable grounds required to warrant a breathalyzer demand.  I do not think
that there can be any dispute that this was Parliament's intention.  In my
view, however, having regard to the purpose of the ALERT scheme and to this
Court's obligation to prefer interpretations that are consistent with Charter 
values over those that are not, this rule cannot be absolute. 

 

94               In my view, there are two Charter 
values which are relevant to interpreting the ambiguity produced by the
interaction of ss. 254(2)  and (3)  of the Criminal Code .  The first is
the value underlying s. 10 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  that an individual only be detained without counsel for as little
time as reasonably possible under the circumstances.  This value no doubt
informed this Court's interpretation of the term ""forthwith"" in s.
254(2)  in R. v. Grant, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 139, and appears to underlie Cory
J.'s approach in the present appeal.  The second is the value underlying s. 8 
of the Charter  that individuals not be subject to unreasonable
interference with their reasonable expectations of privacy.  This value would
appear to find expression in Sopinka J.'s reasons.  My approach differs from
those of my colleagues Cory and Sopinka JJ. because I seek to balance and give
consideration to both values under the circumstances, without specifically
giving primacy to one or the other.

 

95               Since Cory J. has already dealt
cogently with the importance of ascribing an interpretation to s. 254(2)  that
is consistent with the values underlying s. 10 (b) of the Charter ,
I prefer to focus on the underlying s. 8  values in s. 254(3)  that, under the
circumstances, place those s. 10 (b) values in counterpoise. 

 

96               I agree with my colleague Sopinka
J. that ""reasonable and probable grounds"" is not only a statutory
precondition to a breathalyzer demand but also  a touchstone of the Charter . 
I also agree that such grounds ordinarily have both a subjective and an
objective component.  I am uncomfortable, however, with his conclusion that an
officer may hold off administering the test whenever the officer believes there
is credible evidence that suggests that the screening test may be unreliable in
the given circumstances.  His approach would require an officer to assess
subjectively the factual basis for reasonable and probable grounds on the whole
of the circumstances in each and every instance.  It also encourages officers
to wait in ambiguous circumstances, out of an abundance of caution.  With
respect, such an interpretation seems to trench overly on the values underlying
s. 10 (b) of the Charter , and invites second-guessing at trial of
the officer's judgment of a magnitude that strikes me as almost certainly
inconsistent with the nature and purpose of the ALERT scheme.  This scheme, it
must be recalled, was intended by Parliament to facilitate the ""rough and
ready"" roadside evaluation of sobriety with a minimum of inconvenience to
the driver and a maximum of certainty and efficiency to those charged with its administration. 


 

97               Even under the Charter ,
""reasonable and probable grounds"" can mean different things in
different contexts.  This Court has previously referred to the standard of
""reasonable and probable grounds"" as one of ""credibly-based
probability"":  Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p.
167; Baron v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 446, and, on another
occasion, of ""reasonable probability"" or ""reasonable
belief"":  R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1166 (per
Wilson J.).  These different formulations are, themselves, unhelpful for the
purpose of deciding what ""reasonable and probable grounds"" mean in
the case at bar.  What is more important is an examination of the context in
which that phrase, and the values underlying that phrase, arise.

 

98               In Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
Dickson J. (as he then was) observed that the value actually underlying the s.
8  right against unreasonable search and seizure and the oft-cited requirement
that a search be premised on ""reasonable and probable grounds"" is the
""reasonable expectation of privacy"" (at pp. 159-60):

 

The
guarantee of security from unreasonable search and seizure only protects
a reasonable expectation.  This limitation on the right guaranteed by s.
8 , whether it is expressed negatively as freedom from ""unreasonable""
search and seizure, or positively as an entitlement to a ""reasonable""
expectation of privacy, indicates that an assessment must be made as to whether
in a particular situation the public's interest in being left alone by
government must give way to the government's interest in intruding on the
individual's privacy in order to advance its goals, notably those of law
enforcement.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

See also R. v. McKinlay Transport
Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627, at p. 641 (per Wilson J.).  Notably, this
Court has recognized on numerous occasions that what constitutes
""reasonableness"" and what constitutes a ""reasonable expectation
of privacy"" may vary from one context to the other, depending upon the
competing considerations at the heart of the issue:  Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
supra, at p. 155; R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, at pp.
526-28. ""[T]he standard of review of what is `reasonable' in a given
context must be flexible if it is to be realistic and meaningful"":  McKinlay
Transport Ltd., supra, at p. 645 (per Wilson J.).  

 

99               Context has often been
differentiated on the basis of whether the offence is criminal/quasi-criminal
or administrative/regulatory in nature.  See McKinlay Transport Ltd., at
p. 647.  It need not always depend on such factors, however.  In Simmons,
supra, this Court held that the degree of personal privacy reasonably
expected at customs border points is lower than that in most other situations
and that a fair degree of latitude must be given to customs officials in order
for them to effectuate the state interest in controlling both who and what
enters its borders.  This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that the
impugned search in Simmons constituted only a strip search, and
therefore was not so highly invasive of bodily integrity and dignity that it
would be considered unreasonable under s. 8  of the Charter .  Closer to
the question raised in the present appeal, in R. v. Wise, [1992] 1
S.C.R. 527, Cory J. emphasized the special context of the lower expectation of
privacy in a motor vehicle.  In R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at p.
884, moreover, he underlined the fact that driving was a licensed activity:

 

 

[The
licensing requirement] serves to confirm that those who drive are familiar with
the standards of care which must be maintained by all drivers.  There is a
further aspect that must be taken into consideration in light of the licensing
requirement for drivers.  Licensed drivers choose to engage in the regulated
activity of driving.  They place themselves in a position of responsibility to
other members of the public who use the roads.

 

Although these remarks were made in
the context of his discussion of the appropriate mens rea requirement
for the offence of dangerous driving, I believe his comments to be equally
apposite to the context of impaired driving.  Equally relevant is the fact that
this Court has frequently recognized the unique context in which impaired
driving offences arise as a factor in justifying legislation under s. 1  that
was found to violate a Charter  right.  See, e.g., R. v. Whyte,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 3; R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621; R. v. Ladouceur,
[1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257; R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640; R. v.
Dedman, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. 

 

100             What is the nature of the reasonable
expectation of privacy in relation to the monitored activity in question (in this
case, roadside assessments of drivers' sobriety)?  As was the case in Simmons,
supra, I believe that this activity is one in which the reasonable
expectation of privacy is lower due both to the nature of the activity and to
the nature of the means available to regulate it.  ALERT tests, spot checks,
and other such measures all regulate conduct arising in the particular context
of driving and with the particular goal of curtailing a particular subset of
that activity -- impaired driving.  When individuals obtain a driver's licence,
they accept the many responsibilities that come with that privilege and, most
importantly, undertake a responsibility to others to conduct themselves safely
on the nation's roadways.  It is common knowledge, moreover, that impaired
driving is dangerous and that the state must take certain measures to curb this
pressing problem.  People who decide to drink and drive do so either in
conscious disregard for, or wilful acceptance of, the risks which that activity
entails.  Any reasonable expectation of privacy which they may entertain while
in their vehicle is therefore lower with respect to assessments of their
sobriety than with respect to most other activities that do not raise
similar considerations.  Of course, it is fair to say that once police embark
upon investigative action which no longer relates to the regulation of
potentially dangerous driving activity, then the rationale articulated above
may no longer apply:  see, e.g., R. v. Mellenthin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615.

 

101             I am therefore not altogether
convinced that the values underlying s. 8  of the Charter  require that
this Court interpret the ""reasonable and probable grounds"" standard
in the context of the interaction of ss. 254(2)  and (3)  in the same manner as
might otherwise be required in most contexts.  In my view, motorists have a
lesser reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to verification of their
sobriety than they do with respect to other, unrelated offences.  This
expectation is a function of both the nature of the activity engaged in and the
threat that roadside sobriety tests are intended to address.  Those who drive
after consuming alcohol know full well the risks that they run.  It lies ill in
the mouth of a motorist who exhibits symptoms sufficient to found an officer's
reasonable suspicion that there is alcohol in the body to say that he
nonetheless has a reasonable expectation of privacy against reasonable
subsequent investigation of that symptom by way of an ALERT screening test and,
should a fail result register on that test, a breathalyzer test.  Thus, in the
interests of certainty and given the very special context of both the problem
of impaired driving and the means reasonably available to address that problem,
some innovation with respect to the subjective component of ""reasonable
and probable grounds"" is justifiable in order to further Parliament's
manifest purpose of effectively addressing, curtailing, and deterring the bane
of impaired driving through the screening test scheme.  Although I may be
mistaken, I fail to see how this conclusion is not also implicit in my
colleague Cory J.'s reasons.

 

102             Having canvassed what I believe to
be the two primary Charter  values attending the interpretation of ss.
254(2)  and (3) , I now pass to the thorny question of whether a fail on an ALERT
test should, as a matter of law, be sufficient to provide the necessary grounds
for a breathalyzer demand.  As I have already indicated, I believe that a
purposive approach to ss. 254(2)  and (3)  dictates that we generally answer this
question in the affirmative, with some limited exceptions, upon which I shall
elaborate immediately below. 

 

103             Firstly, there may be circumstances
under which it is not only advisable but actually objectively necessary for the
officer to wait a certain period of time in order to obtain a proper sample,
such as to prevent damage to the device's detector cell due to smoke (see R.
v. Kaczmarek (1994), 16 O.R. (3d) 510 (Gen. Div.); R. v. Jackson
(1993), 147 A.R. 173 (Q.B.)), or where the officer has actually seen the
accused consume alcohol or belch or regurgitate -- all actions which the RCMP
manual acknowledges can unduly affect the accuracy of the screening test
because of the presence of mouth alcohol.  In such cases, the officer must
objectively know that the device is more likely than not to yield an incorrect
reading and must know that the device's results could not form the basis for a
breathalyzer demand.  If, in the opinion of the officer, there were
insufficient other indicia of impairment to justify a breathalyzer demand, then
a short wait would be necessary before the ALERT device could be relied on for
such a purpose. 

 

104             Another possibility is that a
motorist may volunteer that he has consumed alcohol within the last 15
minutes.  In such cases, I would disagree with Sopinka J.'s conclusion that an
officer may believe or disbelieve that statement.  For the reasons that I have
outlined above, I believe that the unique context of roadside assessments of
sobriety justifies, as a practical matter, some innovation with respect to the
subjective component of reasonable and probable grounds.  Consequently, in the
interests of certainty, I would say that an officer should, in those cases,
take the motorist at his word and hold off administering the test for
sufficient time to negate the possibility of mouth alcohol affecting the test. 
Moreover, even in the absence of such an assertion, where a police officer
nonetheless honestly believes, for whatever reason, that the motorist has
consumed alcohol or smoked within the last 15 minutes then the officer should
hold off administering the test for 15 minutes.  

 

105             Whenever the officer decides that it
is necessary to wait for a short period in order to ensure the reliability of
the ALERT test, however, the officer should read a prepared statement to the
motorist, essentially saying:  ""I believe that you may have consumed
alcohol or smoked within the last 15 minutes.  Since alcohol consumption or
smoking within the last 15 minutes can render this screening test unreliable, I
will have to ask you, for your own benefit, to wait 15 minutes without smoking
or drinking before I administer this test.""  By indicating to the motorist
the reason for the delay, the officer will give the motorist an opportunity to
volunteer additional information which may enable the officer to require the
motorist to take the test right away.  A motorist who believes that he is sober
and who has not consumed alcohol or smoked within the last 15 minutes will at
that point have the opportunity to volunteer to take the test right away.  This
is consistent with Parliament's intention that the ALERT test be administered
at a minimum of inconvenience to motorists, enabling those who are clearly
below the limit to be on their way.  By contrast, a motorist who suspects that
he may be over the legal limit will probably remain quiet, hoping to profit
from the extra time.  In either case, the officer will then be able to rely
both reasonably and honestly on the ALERT test result for
reasonable and probable grounds.  

 

106             Interpreting s. 254(2) as
contemplating a delay under such circumstances, though violating s. 10 (b),
would be upheld under s. 1  for the very reasons expressed in R. v. Thomsen,
supra.  The reading by police of such a prepared statement where they
have formulated an honest belief of recent consumption would minimally impair
the motorist's s. 10 (b) rights, since it would serve to apprise the
motorist of the reason for the delay, and allow the motorist the opportunity to
make an informed decision to waive that delay, and to communicate that waiver
to the police.   Police have a single, clear guideline on how to act in all
situations.  The administration of the screening tests will be both simplified
and clarified, and challenges at trial to the procedure followed by the officer
will be minimized.  All of this will be accomplished without actually requiring
officers to make specific inquiries of the motorist (since such questions may,
themselves, raise s. 10 (b) Charter  concerns).

 

107             I strongly encourage police to adopt
such a practice.  I believe that it will make life easier for motorists, for
police and for the courts.  I would emphasize, however, that failure by the
officer to read this statement does not necessarily mean that the motorist's s.
10 (b) rights have been violated.  The statement need only be read on
those occasions when an officer believes, for any credible reason, in recent
smoking or alcohol consumption.  Mere knowledge, for instance, that the accused
has consumed alcohol during the course of the evening, absent other
circumstances, would not be sufficiently precise to found such a belief, or to
warrant a delay in the administering of the test.

 

 

108             I agree with Sopinka J. that where
an officer waits a reasonable amount of time in order to ensure that the ALERT
test yields accurate results, this delay is not inconsistent with the
requirement in s. 254(2) that the sample be provided ""forthwith"", nor
with this Court's pronouncements in R. v. Grant, supra, and R.
v. Thomsen, supra.  I would simply note that in neither of those
cases did this Court turn its mind to contexts in which the delay resulted from
the exercise of an abundance of reasonable care.  Where the police wait in
order to ensure the accuracy of the screening test, this waiting period can
only benefit the driver, since it virtually eliminates the possibility that he
or she will blow a false ""fail"" and be taken in for a breathalyzer on
an erroneous basis.  I cannot help but observe that the admission of
breathalyzer evidence obtained under such circumstances, even if it were
obtained in violation of the Charter , could hardly be seen to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.  

 

109             To summarize, this Court recognized
in Grant, supra, that it is imprudent to make blanket assertions
about what length of delay would be inconsistent with the term
""forthwith"" in s. 254(2).  I believe that this term must be
approached in a manner that recognizes the interrelationship of ss. 254(2)  and
(3) .  In my opinion, it would defy the wording of s. 254(3)  and defeat the
values underlying s. 8  of the Charter  to conclude that a fail on an
ALERT test can always form the basis for such a demand.  It would frustrate the
manifest intention of Parliament and invite absurdity to define
""forthwith"" so strictly that officers must administer the test without
delay even in circumstances where they could not even objectively rely on the
screening test result for a ""proper analysis"" and thus for the
reasonable and probable grounds required under s. 254(3)  for a breathalyzer
demand.  At the same time, I am concerned that it may trench unduly on the
values underlying s. 10 (b) of the Charter  to conclude, without
elaboration or guidance to the police, that an officer may hold off
administering the test whenever he believes there to be credible evidence that
the screening test may not yield accurate results under the circumstances.  I
also believe such an interpretation to be inconsistent with Parliament's
intention that the screening test be administered with the greatest degree of
ease, certainty and efficiency possible to all concerned.

 

110             In the present case, it would appear
from the trial record that the officer did observe other signs of impairment
that could have furnished the requisite belief for a breathalyzer demand.  The
officer's testimony, however, suggests that he did not form the requisite
belief until after he had administered the screening test.  The Court of Appeal
disposed of this case on that basis.  Like my colleague Sopinka J., I am
therefore prepared to assume that the officer relied on the screening test
result as the basis for his breathalyzer demand.  For the reasons outlined
above, I would conclude that the officer was entitled to rely on the fail
registered by the screening device to found the requisite belief for a breathalyzer
demand pursuant to s. 254(3) .  No evidence was adduced that suggested that the
officer was aware of recent alcohol consumption or any other factors that could
reasonably affect the reliability of the device.  As such, he was entitled to
rely on the ALERT test as a basis for his breathalyzer demand.

 

111             Consequently, I would allow the
appeal and reinstate the respondent's conviction.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

112             Gonthier
J. -- I agree with Justice Sopinka and also concur with the suggestions
of Justice L'Heureux-Dubé as to certain police procedures being desirable in
the circumstances she describes, though not mandatory.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Sentencing ‑‑ Appeal from sentence -- Sentencing provision amended
after sentence pronounced but before judgment made on appeal from sentence ‑‑
Interpretation Act  (s. 44 (e)) providing for imposition of reduced
punishment where punishment reduced by new enactment ‑‑ Whether or
not judicial decisions on appeals from sentence encompassed by Interpretation
Act provision ‑‑ Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I‑21 ,
s. 44 (e) ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 100 
(rep. & sub. c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 14 , and later rep. & sub. by S.C.
1991, c. 40, s. 12(1)).

 

                   Appellant, a police
officer, was found to have used excessive force in making a lawful arrest,
convicted of assault causing bodily harm and granted a conditional discharge
with probation.  The mandatory wording of s. 100  of the Criminal Code 
compelled the trial judge to make an order prohibiting the possession of a
firearm, even though it would prevent the appellant from continuing with his
employment.

 

                   The appellant
appealed from both the conviction and the firearms prohibition and the
respondent appealed the granting of the conditional discharge.  The Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal even though amendments to s. 100 , which were
proclaimed after sentencing and before the judgment on appeal from sentence,
removed the mandatory nature of the order and permitted the court to exercise
its discretion in limited circumstances.  Section 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act  provides that an offender is entitled to the benefit of the lesser
penalty or punishment where the penalty or punishment has been imposed or adjudged
after the sentencing provision has been amended to reduce the penalty or
punishment.  The pivotal issue here was whether or not the term
""adjudged"" in the English version of s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act  included judicial decisions on appeals from sentence so that the
appellant should receive the benefit of the amended s. 100 of the Code.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The word
""adjudged"" encompasses the decision of a court of appeal hearing a
sentence appeal.  The appellate court is exercising a ""judicial""
function in making a ""decision"" about whether or not a sentence is
appropriate.  Its role in this regard lies somewhere between appellate de
novo sentencing and a high deferential standard of patent
unreasonableness.  A plain reading of the word ""adjudged"" includes
such a judicial determination of the fitness of sentence, notwithstanding that
this determination takes place in the context of a review.

 

                   Section 44 (e)
of the Interpretation Act  resolves the question raised by this appeal. 
The words ""imposed or adjudged"" in this section are to be read
disjunctively, and therefore with vertical effect, with the result that a court
of appeal hearing an appeal from sentence is ""adjudging"" the issue of
sentence within the meaning of this provision.  The offender, therefore, in
circumstances where an amendment to a sentencing provision has been passed
after conviction and sentence by the trial judge but before the appeal has been
""decided"", is entitled to the benefit of the lesser penalty or
punishment.  The French wording of s. 44 (e) does not include the
term ""adjudged"", but instead states ""les sanctions dont
l'allégement est prévu par le nouveau texte sont, après l'abrogation, réduites
en conséquence"".  The absence of the word ""adjudged"" in the
French version, however, does not dispose of the issue of whether the benefit
of legislative amendments extends to appeals and does not impugn the
conclusions reached regarding the meaning of ""adjudged"".  Where
conflict or ambiguity exists between the two official texts of the Interpretation
Act  in their application to a sentencing provision, the interpretation
which is more favourable to the accused should be adopted.  Given the meaning
of the language used by Parliament, the legislative history of the amendments
to the Interpretation Act  which parallel those of the rights of appeal
from sentence was not conclusive of the matter.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  Section 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act  does not
apply here because the punishment was ""adjudged"" prior to the
amendment of s. 100 of the Code.  Absent a clear indication that
the amended s. 100 of the Code should apply to persons appealing a
sentence rendered by virtue of the former version of that section, the
applicable law is the law as it stood at the time of trial sentencing.

 

                   A dictionary review
of definitions of the word ""adjudged"" cannot be determinative of the
issue because all of the definitions could be applied to the trial context. 
The word ""imposed"" relates to the sentence ""imposed"" at
trial.  Parliament added the words ""or adjudged"" to s. 44 (e)
of the Interpretation Act  in order to indicate clearly that the section
applied only to the trial level and to remove an ambiguity created by the words
""any judgment"" which are found in earlier versions of the section and
which suggest that it could apply to judgments on appeal.  Parliament chose to
not retain the initial wording in order to limit the right to the benefit of a
lesser sanction to determination at trial and would have used clear wording if
it had intended the words ""or adjudged"" to connote appellate
finality.  Furthermore, the words ""or adjudged"" as used in
s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act  expand laterally (as
opposed to vertically so as to include the appellate courts) the scope of the
provision in such a way as to cover all possible penal orders made in the trial
context.

 

                   The French version
of s. 44 (e) does not use the term ""adjudged"" and simply
states that ""les sanctions dont l'allégement est prévu par le nouveau
texte sont, après l'abrogation, réduites en conséquence"".  The absence
of the French equivalent of the words ""or adjudged"" demonstrates that
Parliament did not intend to extend the right to the benefit of a lesser sanction
beyond trial sentencing by the use of the word ""adjudged"".  The
question raised by this appeal could not therefore be resolved by strictly
focusing on the word ""adjudged"" as used in the English version of
s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act .

 

                   A parallel has been
drawn between s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act and
s. 11 (i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  It
would be inconsistent to hold that s. 44 (e), which inspired
s. 11 (i) of the Charter , extends the right to the benefit of
a lesser sanction further than the Charter  guarantee.

 

                   Several policy
considerations should be considered when determining the extent to which such a
right can be applied.  First, an overly broad interpretation extending to
appellate review can give rise to frivolous appeals because appeals could be
lodged in the hope that the law will change by the time the appeal is heard. 
Secondly, a person charged with an offence should be subject to the punishment
that the Code carried for that offence at the time the offence was
committed.  The lodging of an appeal should be inconsequential and not have the
effect of varying the applicable law concerning sentencing.  Finally, the s.
44 (e) right to the benefit of a lesser sanction must be considered in
conjunction with s. 687 of the Code which deals with powers of
courts of appeal regarding sentence appeals.  The appellate courts are to
determine whether there has been an error on the part of the trial judge and,
absent error, must refrain from intervening.  Once a sentence is properly
rendered at trial, an amended statutory provision proclaimed thereafter cannot
be substituted for the former relevant statutory provision, notwithstanding an
appeal from the trial decision.

 

                   The rule in R.
v. Wigman, which allows an accused still ""in the system"" at the
appeal stage to benefit from an interpretation of law made after the conviction
at trial, was developed on the basis that the previous interpretation of the
law was erroneous.  This rule was not applicable here given the absence of
error at trial.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci
and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

1                 Major
J. -- This appeal raises the issue of the extent to which a person who
has been convicted of an offence may benefit from legislative changes affecting
sentence. In particular, the question of law to be resolved is whether
appellate proceedings are included within the scope of s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , or s. 11 (i) of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms . 

Facts

 

2                 The appellant, a police officer
in Windsor, was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The victim, Gerald Smith,
was taking out his garbage one evening when the appellant drove by in his
police cruiser and asked Smith for identification. Smith refused, stating that
he lived there. The appellant got out of the car and attempted to arrest the
victim and a struggle ensued. 

 

3                 At trial, there was an issue as
to whether or not the assault was racially motivated.  In a decision released
on March 23, 1992, Haines J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, found that
the appellant had used excessive force in making a lawful arrest but that the
offence was not racially motivated. The trial judge found the appellant guilty
of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(1)(b) of the Code.
On April 3, 1992, he granted the appellant a conditional discharge with
probation for 18 months. 

 

4                 In sentencing the appellant,
Haines J. concluded that he was compelled by the mandatory wording of s. 100 of
the Code to make an order prohibiting the possession of a firearm.
Haines J. stated that it was ""truly unfortunate"" that he had to
impose a prohibition order, as this could defeat the rehabilitative purpose of
the conditional discharge in that the appellant being a police officer could
not continue that employment unless he was able to possess a firearm.  Haines
J. imposed the prohibition for the minimum period of 5 years.  

 

5                 The appellant appealed from both
the conviction and the firearms prohibition. The respondent appealed the
granting of the conditional discharge.  The appeals were heard by the Ontario
Court of Appeal on December 22, 1993.

 

6                 Prior to the hearing of the
appeal, on August 1, 1992, an amendment to s. 100 of the Code was
proclaimed.  The amendment had been passed by Parliament before sentencing in
this case but had not been proclaimed.  The new s. 100  removed the mandatory
nature of the order under s. 100  and permitted the exercise of discretion by
the court in certain limited circumstances, which the appellant claimed were
applicable to him.  The appeal was heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal with
the appeal in the similar case of R. v. Luke (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 51.  

 

Judgments

 

Ontario Court of Appeal

 

7                 In both R. v. Luke and
this case, the dispositive issue turned on the meaning of s. 11 (i) of
the Charter  and s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act , and
whether either or both those provisions entitled the appellant to the benefit
of the amended provisions.    

 

8                 The Court of Appeal held in R.
v. Luke that s. 7  of the Charter  did not apply, as s. 11 (i)
specifically addressed the problem but s. 11 (i) related only to
sentencing at the trial level and had no application to a review of the
sentence on appeal.  In this conclusion they relied on R. v. Potvin,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 880. The court also held that s. 44 (e) was of no
assistance to the appellant, as the word ""adjudged"" did not extend to
cover an appellate review of sentence. 

 

9                 The Ontario Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal relating to s. 12  of the Charter  on the basis that
the firearms prohibition did not constitute cruel and unusual treatment or
punishment.

 

10               In dismissing the appeal in this
case, the Court of Appeal stated ""we cannot for the reasons set out in Luke
apply the new section [of the Criminal Code ] which was passed but not
proclaimed at the time of trial and imposition of sentence"". 

 

Issues

 

11               The following issues were raised:

 

                   1.Does
the term ""adjudged"" in s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act 
include judicial decisions on appeals from sentence, so that the appellant
should receive the benefit of the amended s. 100  of the Criminal Code ? 

 

                   2.Does
the expression ""time of sentencing"" in s. 11 (i) of the Charter 
include an appeal from sentence, so that the appellant should receive the
benefit of the amended version of s. 100 of the Code?

 

                   3.Does
the ""in the system"" principle articulated by this Court in R. v.
Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246, apply to assist the appellant? 

 

                   4.If
the answers to these questions are no, does the sentence imposed under the
former s. 100 of the Code constitute cruel and unusual treatment or
punishment violating s. 12  of the Charter , such that a constitutional
exemption should be available?

The former s. 100  of the Criminal
Code  (effected by R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 14) read as follows:

 

                   100.
(1)  Where an
offender is convicted or discharged under section 736 of an indictable offence
in the commission of which violence against a person is used, threatened or
attempted and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten
years or more or of an offence under section 85, the court that sentences the
offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for
that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from having in his
possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for any period
of time specified in the order that commences on the day the order is made and
expires not earlier than

 

(a)
in the case of a first conviction for such an offence, five years, and

 

(b)
in any other case, ten years. . . 

 

The amended version of s. 100  of the Criminal
Code , enacted by S.C. 1991, c. 40, s. 12(1), provides:

 

                   100. (1) Where an offender is convicted or
discharged under section 736 of an indictable offence in the commission of
which violence against a person is used, threatened or attempted and for which
the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more or of an
offence under section 85, the court that sentences the offender shall, subject
to subsections (1.1) to (1.3), in addition to any other punishment that may be
imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from
possessing any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for any period
of time specified in the order that commences on the day on which the order is
made and expires not earlier than

 

(a)
in the case of a first conviction for such an offence, ten years, and

 

(b)
in any other case, life, 

 

after
the time of the offender's release from imprisonment after conviction for the
offence or, if the offender is not then imprisoned or subject to imprisonment,
after the time of the offender's conviction or discharge for that offence. 

 

                   (1.1)    
The court is not required to make an order under subsection (1) where the court
is satisfied that the offender has established that

 

(a)               it
is not desirable in the interests of the safety of the offender or of any other
person that the order be made; and

 

(b)               the
circumstances are such that it would not be appropriate to make the order.

 

                   (1.2)
In considering whether the circumstances are such that it would not be
appropriate to make an order under subsection (1), the court shall consider

 

(a)               the
criminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence and the
circumstances surrounding its commission;

 

(b)               whether
the offender needs a firearm for the sustenance of the offender or the
offender's family; and

 

(c)               whether
the order would constitute a virtual prohibition against employment in the only
vocation open to the offender.

 

                   (1.3)
Where the court does not make an order under subsection (1), the court shall
give reasons why the order is not being made. 

 

Analysis

 

Introduction

 

12               While the former s. 100 of the Code
was mandatory in its effect, the amended provisions now allow the trial
judge a discretion not to make the prohibition order.

 

13               Section 100(1.1)(b) states
that where the circumstances are such that the order would not be appropriate,
the court is not required to make the prohibition order. Section 100(1.2) sets
out the factors which the court shall consider in determining the
appropriateness of the order.

 

14               Some of the relevant factors to be
considered are the criminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence,
the circumstances of its commission, and the effect on future employment or
livelihood.

 

Section 44(e) of the Interpretation
Act

  

15               The appellant's position is that
the phrase ""imposed or adjudged"" in s. 44 (e) should be read
disjunctively, with the result that an appeal court hearing an appeal from
sentence is ""adjudging"" or adjudicating on the issue of sentence,
within the meaning of s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act.

 

16               The respondent, to the contrary,
contends that the phrase should be read conjunctively and consequently both
words must be examined together.  While ""adjudged"" is broader than
""imposed"", respondent argues, it was included in the provision simply
to provide grammatical consistency.  The respondent thus concludes that
""adjudged"" refers to certain types of orders made at trial which
could not be said to be ""imposed"", such as forfeiture orders or
fines.  If this proposition is accepted and the words ""imposed"" and
""adjudged"" read conjunctively, then the word ""adjudged""
only has significance in extending the scope of s. 44 (e) laterally
(to encompass all orders available at the trial level), rather than vertically
(to include appellate review).

 

17               The respondent also relies on the
legislative history of the provision for support.  The 1886 version of s. 44 (e)
provided that changes in legislation would be applied to ""any judgment
to be pronounced after such repeal or revocation"" (emphasis added): The
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 1, s. 7(53).  While there were no
statutory rights of appeal against sentence at that time, Parliament adopted
legislation allowing appeals from sentence in 1892 and 1923. In 1906, the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 1, s. 19(2)(d) adopted the current wording of
""imposed or adjudged"".  The respondent thus argues that this
amendment, during the same period that Parliament was extending appeal rights
to sentences, is an indication that the provision was intended to apply only at
the trial level.

 

18               The Oxford English Dictionary
(2nd ed. 1989), defines ""impose"" as ""4. To lay on, as something
to be borne, endured, or submitted to; to inflict (something) on or upon;
to levy or enforce authoritatively or arbitrarily"" (emphasis in original).


 

19               ""Adjudged"", on the other
hand, is defined as: ""1. Determined, decided, or settled judicially. ...
2. Judged, deemed, regarded, held. ... 3. Sentenced, doomed. ... 4. Awarded
judicially. ..."" 

 

20               Black's Law Dictionary (5th
ed. 1979), defines ""adjudge"" in this manner: ""To pass on
judicially, to decide, settle, or decree, or to sentence or condemn. ...
Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; equivalent of convicted and
sentenced. Implies a judicial determination of a fact, and the entry of a
judgment."" 

 

21               The meaning of ""adjudge""
was considered in Morris v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405. The issue
was whether a finding of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, could be construed as a conviction under the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, s. 12. A Juvenile Court judge, under
the Act, was empowered to adjudge a child to have committed a delinquency,
rather than to convict a child of having committed a delinquency. The specific
issue was thus whether or not the term ""adjudge"" included
""convict"". Pratte J. considered the meaning of ""to adjudge""
at pp. 430‑31:

 

                   The
meaning of the verb ""to adjudge"" is broader than and includes that of
""to convict""; generally, ""to adjudge"" means to pronounce
judicially and one of its meanings is to sentence or condemn; Black's Law Dictionary,
4th ed., Vo [sic] ""adjudge"":

 

adjudge. To pass on judicially, to decide, settle, or decree, or to sentence
or condemn.  People v. Rave, 364 Ill. 72, 3 N.E. 2d 972, 975.

 

Webster's
Third New International Dictionary:

 

1(a)
To decide or rule upon as a judge or with judicial or quasi-judicial
powers;...(b) to pronounce judicially...2. archaic, To sentence or
condemn (a person) to some punishment.

 

Funk
& Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language:

 

1.
To award or bestow by formal decision;...2(1) To give a judicial decision
concerning; adjudicate upon; decide judicially.

 

                   In
general use, adjudge does not always imply that the decision given is
final.  Judges of inferior courts, or arbitrators and referees, adjudge of
matters sometimes transmitted to superior courts for final adjudication... 3.
To decree; sentence; condemn; as King Charles was adjudged to die.

 

                   In
some cases, the word ""adjudged"" has been held to be synonymous with
""convicted"":

 

Tarlo's
Estate (1934), 172 A.
139, at p. 140, 315 Pa. 321;

 

Blaufus
v. People (1877), 69
N.Y. 107, at p. 111, 25 Am. Rep. 148.

 

                   And
in Old English law, the word ""adjudged"" was sometimes used to mean
""sentenced"" (Archbold, Criminal Pleading and Evidence, 19th
ed., at p. 400).

 

                   In
my opinion, therefore, the power of the juvenile court to adjudge guilt is
equivalent to the power of an ordinary criminal court to convict and I cannot
see any essential difference between the power to adjudge a person guilty of an
offence and the power to convict a person of the same offence.  With respect, I
find no merit in the submission of the appellant that a finding of delinquency
should not be construed as a conviction for the purposes of s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act .

 

22               From an examination of the meaning
of the word ""adjudge"",  it would encompass the decision of a court of
appeal hearing a sentence appeal. That court is exercising a
""judicial"" function in making a ""decision"" about whether a
sentence is appropriate or not. Section 687 of the Code provides:

 

                   687.
(1) Where an appeal
is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is
one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and
may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

 

(a)
vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which
the accused was convicted; or

 

(b)
dismiss the appeal.

 

                   (2)
A judgment of a court of appeal that varies the sentence of an accused who was
convicted has the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the
trial court.

 

23               The court of appeal has a
discretion similar to that of a trial judge in assessing the fitness of the
sentence.

 

24               The role of the courts of appeal
in this regard is in my opinion correctly expressed by Clayton Ruby in Sentencing
(4th ed. 1994), at p. 452, where he concludes that it is not appellate de
novo sentencing nor is it a high deferential standard of patent
unreasonableness.  The standard of review lies somewhere in between.  A plain
reading of the word ""adjudge""  includes such a judicial determination
of the fitness of sentence, notwithstanding that this determination takes place
in the context of a review. 

 

25               The predecessor to s. 44 (e)
was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in Lyle v. Minister of
Employment and Immigration, [1982] 2 F.C. 821. The issue was whether the
Immigration Appeal Board, in hearing an appeal from a deportation order, was
""imposing or adjudging"" that deportation order. The Board, in the
decision appealed from at p. 825, had stated:

 

...in
my view the Board as an appellate tribunal is not ""adjudging"" an
order of deportation which is before it on appeal. It is not, and never has
been, the deporting authority; all it does on appeal is determine whether or
not a deportation order already made is in accordance with the law: the
imposition of the ""penalty"" has already been made. 

 

26               Heald J. for the Federal Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal. In finding the board in error, he stated at p. 825:

 

The
function which the Board performs in dealing with appeals from deportation
orders is clearly an adjudication of the matter. Black's Law Dictionary,
Fifth Edition, defines ""Adjudge"" as, inter alia, ""To pass
on judicially, to decide, settle. . ."". Similar definitions are
to be found in The Concise Oxford Dictionary and numerous other
recognized works. As I read the Board's reasons, they appear to hold that the
only ""adjudication"" contemplated by paragraph 36(e) is the
original adjudication when the penalty was imposed. Put another way, the
Board's reasoning necessarily implies an interpretation of paragraph 36(e)
which would substitute and for or in the expression ""imposed
or adjudged"". Had Parliament intended to express the manner conjunctively
rather than disjunctively, we can assume that it would have done so. Since
the expression used is clearly disjunctive, it must be presumed that Parliament
did not intend imposition and adjudication to be synonymous. In the
circumstances of the case, I am satisfied that Board Decision No. 2 was an
adjudication after repeal of the 1952 Immigration Act. [Last emphasis
added.]

 

27               I conclude that s. 44(e) of
the Interpretation Act resolves the question raised by this appeal.
Where an amendment to a sentencing provision has been passed after conviction
and sentence by the trial judge, but before the appeal has been
""decided"", the offender is entitled to the benefit of the lesser
penalty or punishment. The court of appeal, in reviewing a trial decision on
sentence, is ""adjudging"" that sentence, in that it considers it
judicially. The respondent's contention that ""adjudge"" extends only
to the options on penalty that may be ordered at trial is too narrow an
approach to the interpretation of s. 44(e), and disregards the meaning
of the word ""adjudge"".

 

28               In reaching this conclusion, I am
mindful of the fact that the French wording of s. 44 (e) does not include
the term ""adjudged"", but instead states ""les sanctions dont
l'allégement est prévu par le nouveau texte sont, après l'abrogation, réduites
en conséquence"". Where conflict or ambiguity exists between the two
official texts of the Interpretation Act in their application to a
sentencing provision the general interpretive principle of strict construction
of penal laws should govern.  That is, the interpretation which is more
favourable to the accused should be adopted: Driedger on the Construction of
Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), by Ruth Sullivan, at pp. 357-362; Pierre-André
Côté, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at pp.
395-401. In any event, the absence of the word ""adjudge"" in the
French version is not dispositive of whether the benefit of legislative
amendments extends to appeals.  Nor does it impugn the conclusions reached
regarding the meaning of ""adjudge"". 

 

29               Similarly, the argument of the
respondent that the legislative history of the amendments to the Interpretation
Act parallel those of the rights of appeal from sentence cannot be
conclusive of the matter in light of the meaning of the language which is used
by Parliament. 

 

30               While s. 44(e) of the Interpretation
Act disposes of the appeal, these reasons should not be read as commenting
in any way on the other grounds raised being ss. 11 (i) and 12  of the Charter 
as well as whether the ""in the system"" principle has any application.

 

Disposition

 

31               The appeal is allowed and the case
referred back to the trial judge to determine whether the discretion provided
for in ss. 100(1.1) and (1.2) should be exercised in the appellant's favour.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

32               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- As my colleague Justice Major has pointed out, this
appeal raises the issue of whether an accused is entitled to benefit from a
statutory amendment (namely to s. 100  of the Criminal Code  (effected by
S.C. 1991, c. 40, s. 12(1))) proclaimed in force after sentencing but prior to
the hearing of an appeal with respect to the sentence.  More particularly, this
appeal focuses on whether appellate review falls within the ambit of s. 44 (e)
of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21 , in such a way as to
provide an appellate court with the authority to apply statutory amendments
that have occurred after sentencing, in the absence, as here, of transitory
provisions to that effect.

 

33               My colleague concludes that an
accused is entitled to the benefit of the amended provision.  I disagree.

 

34               The facts are recounted by Major
J.  Suffice it to recall that the appellant, a police officer, was convicted of
assault causing bodily harm.  As a result of this conviction, a mandatory
five-year prohibition on the possession of firearms was imposed upon the
appellant pursuant to s. 100 of the Code (rep. & sub. by R.S.C.,
1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 14).  That provision read as follows at the time of
the trial:

 

                   100.
(1)  Where an
offender is convicted or discharged under section 736 of an indictable offence
in the commission of which violence against a person is used, threatened or
attempted and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten
years or more or of an offence under section 85, the court that sentences
the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed
for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from having in his
possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for any
period of time specified in the order that commences on the day the order is
made and expires not earlier than

 

(a)
in the case of a first conviction for such an offence, five years, and

 

(b)
in any other case, ten years. . .  [Emphasis added.]

 

35               The appellant appealed both his
sentence and the firearms prohibition.  Prior to the hearing of the appeal, an
amendment to s. 100 of the Code was proclaimed into force.  In
proclaiming this amendment, Parliament withdrew the mandatory nature of s. 100 
firearm prohibition orders by permitting the exercise of judicial discretion in
certain circumstances.  Section 100 of the Code (rep. & sub. by S.C.
1991, c. 40, s. 12(1)) now reads as follows:

 

                   100.
(1) Where an offender
is convicted or discharged under section 736 of an indictable offence in the
commission of which violence against a person is used, threatened or attempted
and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or
more or of an offence under section 85, the court that sentences the offender
shall, subject to subsections (1.1) to (1.3), in addition to any other
punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the
offender from possessing any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance
for any period of time specified in the order that commences on the day on
which the order is made and expires not earlier than

 

                   (a)
in the case of a first conviction for such an offence, ten years, and

 

(b)
in any other case, life,

 

after
the time of the offender's release from imprisonment after conviction for the
offence or, if the offender is not then imprisoned or subject to imprisonment,
after the time of the offender's conviction or discharge for that offence.

 

                   (1.1)
The court is not required to make an order under subsection (1) where
the court is satisfied that the offender has established that

 

(a)
it is not desirable in the interests of the safety of the offender or of any
other person that the order be made; and

 

(b)
the circumstances are such that it would not be appropriate to make the
order.

 

                   (1.2)
In considering whether the circumstances are such that it would not be
appropriate to make an order under subsection (1), the court shall consider

 

(a)
the criminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence and the
circumstances surrounding its commission;

 

(b)
whether the offender needs a firearm for the sustenance of the offender or
the offender's family; and

 

(c)
whether the order would constitute a virtual prohibition against employment
in the only vocation open to the offender. [Emphasis added.]

 

37               The appellant submits that he
should be allowed to rely upon s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation Act 
in order to benefit from this statutory amendment to s. 100 of the Code. 
He contends that the words ""imposed or adjudged"" used in s. 44 (e)
of the Interpretation Act  must be read disjunctively, and that
consequently, the term ""adjudged"" encompasses appellate adjudication
with respect to sentence.  The appellant further contends that the expression
""time of sentencing"" in s. 11 (i) of the Charter  also
includes an appeal from sentence and that the ""in the system""
principle flowing from this Court's decision in R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 246, should apply to cases of statutory amendments.  Finally, the
appellant alleges that the sentence imposed under the former s. 100 of the Code
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of s. 12  of the Charter 
and that consequently, he should be granted a constitutional exemption.

 

XXXVIa.    Section
44 (e) of the Interpretation Act  provides as follows:

 

                   44.  Where an enactment, in this section
called the ""former enactment"", is repealed and another enactment, in
this section called the ""new enactment"", is substituted therefor, 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(e)
when any punishment, penalty or forfeiture is reduced or mitigated by the new
enactment, the punishment, penalty or forfeiture if imposed or adjudged
after the repeal shall be reduced or mitigated accordingly;  [Emphasis
added.]

 

This provision of the Interpretation
Act  enables an accused to benefit from a reduced or mitigated penalty when
a statutory amendment occurs prior to the time at which the punishment
is ""imposed or adjudged"".  The question before us is whether it does
so subsequent to the sentence at trial, i.e., when the accused is still
""in the system"" and awaiting his appeal to be heard.

 

38               In determining whether the words
""or adjudged"" encompass appellate review, Griffiths J.A. for the Court
of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Luke (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 51, which
raised the same issue and in which judgment was handed down just shortly before
the judgment in the case at hand, concluded at p. 60 that these words did not
extend to appellate review:

 

. .
. the words ""or adjudged"" in s. 44 (e) of the Interpretation
Act , while they clearly must mean more than simply ""imposed"", do
not extend the scope of the provision to cover an appellate review.  In my
opinion, ""adjudged"" simply means to ""pronounce, decide, or pass
on"" judicially.  Section 44 (e) would have application at the trial
level only and provides no relief to the accused on appeal, where the function
of the appellate court is essentially to review.

 

39               I agree.  I am of the view that s.
44 (e) of the Interpretation Act  cannot be relied upon by the
appellant in this case since his punishment was ""adjudged"" prior
to the amendment of s. 100 of the Code.  My conclusion stems from
statutory interpretation as well as from reasons of policy.

 

Statutory Interpretation

 

40               My colleague has reviewed the
dictionary definitions of the word ""adjudged"" and it is not necessary
to repeat that exercise here.  One can take any of those definitions as applying
to the trial context.  As Laskin C.J. pointed out in Attorney General for
Ontario v. Regional Municipality of Peel, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1134, at p. 1145,
it must be recognized ""how much context and purpose relate to
meaning"".  Approving this citation, Pierre-André Côté in The
Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at p. 221, adds:

 

                   The
need to determine the word's meaning within the context of the statute
remains.  Dictionaries provide meanings for a number of standard and recurring
situations.  Even the best of them will only tersely indicate the context in
which a particular meaning is used.  The range of meanings in a dictionary is
necessarily limited. 

 

See also R. v. Heywood, [1994]
3 S.C.R. 761.

 

41               Thus, in my view, my colleague's
dictionary exercise  is in no way conclusive nor is it determinative of the
issue at hand.  What is clear here is that the word ""imposed"" relates
to the sentence ""imposed"" at trial.  The question then becomes why
did Parliament believe it necessary to add the words ""or adjudged""? 
Is it, as my colleague Major J. concludes, to cover the appeal, or is it for
another reason which can be easily explained?

 

42               A review of the legislative
history of s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act  does in fact
provide an easily explainable reason for which Parliament felt it necessary to
add the words ""or adjudged"".  The original version of s. 44(e)
of the Interpretation Act dates back to 1886 (The Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1886, c. 1) and it provided as follows:

 

                   7.  In every Act of the Parliament of
Canada, unless the context otherwise requires: --

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   (53.)
. . . whenever any penalty, forfeiture or punishment is mitigated by any . . .
provisions . . ., such provisions shall be extended and applied to any
judgment to be pronounced after such repeal or revocation: [Emphasis
added.]

 

43               At first blush, the use of the
words ""any judgment"" could be interpreted as including judgments on
appeal.  However, Parliament's true intent in this regard appears more clearly
in light of a 1906 amendment (Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 1)
whereby the words ""any judgment"" were replaced by ""imposed or
adjudged"".  The 1906 amended version read as follows:

 

                   19. . . .

 

                   2.
If other provisions are substituted for those so repealed or revoked, then,
unless the contrary intention appears, -- 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d)
if any penalty, forfeiture or punishment is reduced or mitigated by any of the
provisions of the Act or regulation whereby such other provisions are
substituted, the penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if imposed or adjudged
after such repeal or revocation, shall be reduced or mitigated accordingly.
[Emphasis added.]

 

44               The legislative context at the
time this amendment was proclaimed was characterized by the granting of rights
of appeal against sentences that had previously never been granted (The
Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, ss. 744, 766).  Given this context,
respondent submits that Parliament's choice of amending words, namely from
""any judgment"" to ""imposed or adjudged"", is an indication
that s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act was only meant to apply
at the trial level.  I am in full agreement with this submission and believe
that Parliament chose to not retain the initial wording of the predecessor of
s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act precisely in order to limit
the extent to which the right to the benefit of a lesser sanction could be
relied upon, i.e., not beyond determination at trial.

 

45               I believe that had Parliament
wanted the words ""or adjudged"" to connote appellate finality, it
would have chosen clear wording to that effect.  As the respondent points out,
phrases such as ""reviewed on appeal"" or ""finally decided""
could presumably have been used by Parliament when it adopted s. 44(e)
of the Interpretation Act, had it in fact wished to extend the right to
the benefit of a lesser sanction beyond trial sentencing to include appellate
review.

 

46               Furthermore, the use of the words
""or adjudged"" is grammatically necessary to encompass all conceivable
judicial orders of a penal nature available at the trial level.  The word
""imposed"", in and of itself, does not embrace the full range of
possible trial orders.  For example, as respondent points out, forfeitures, which
are included in s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act, are in rem
orders whereby ""adjudged"" property has led to a forfeiture of
proceeds generated from that property.  Clearly, the use of the word
""adjudged"" in such a case is required given that a forfeiture is not,
in this context, ""imposed"".  Therefore, the words ""or
adjudged"" as used in s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act
simply laterally expand the scope of the provision in such a way as to cover
all possible penal orders made in the trial context.

 

47               My colleague Major J. is of the
opinion that this interpretation is too narrow an approach and that it
disregards the meaning of the word ""adjudged"".  He also adds that a
review of the legislative history with regards to the use of the terms ""or
adjudged"" is not conclusive.  In this respect, I must point out that the
French version of s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act makes no use
whatsoever of the term ""adjudged"" and simply states that ""les
sanctions dont l'allégement est prévu par le nouveau texte sont, après
l'abrogation, réduites en conséquence"".  The absence of the French
equivalent of the words ""or adjudged"" demonstrates, at the very
least, that Parliament has in no way clearly indicated an intention to extend
the right to the benefit of a lesser sanction beyond trial sentencing through
the use of the word ""adjudged"".  The question raised by this appeal
cannot therefore be resolved by strictly focusing on the word
""adjudged"" as used in the English version of s. 44(e) of the 

Interpretation Act.

 

48               Before turning to the policy
considerations raised by the case at hand, I must finally point out that the
case of Re Mitchell and The Queen (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. H.C.),
is noteworthy for the purposes of the case at hand.  In particular, Linden J.
drew a parallel between s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act (then
s. 36(e)) and s. 11 (i) of the Charter , which constitutes
the constitutional expression of the right to the benefit of a lesser
punishment.  Linden J. remarked that both provisions were consistent in that
they give ""the accused the advantage of the lesser penalty only if the
change comes before he is sentenced"".  In discussing s. 44(e) of
the Interpretation Act, Linden J. concluded at pp. 207‑8:

 

Thus,
under Canadian law as it stood prior to the enactment of the Charter , there was
no generally applicable statutory provision enabling a person convicted of an
offence to be given a reduced penalty if, at any time following conviction,
a new statute provided for a lighter penalty; convicted persons could benefit
from such a reduction only if punishment were imposed after the repeal
or if it was expressly provided for in the statute. [Underlining added.] 

 

49               I note that in R. v. Milne,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 512, this Court implicitly adopted Linden J.'s interpretation
of s. 11 (i) of the Charter  which, in turn, was based in part on
his interpretation of s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act. 
Moreover, in R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 908, albeit in obiter,
Sopinka J. intimated on behalf of the majority that s. 11 (i) of the Charter 
does not extend to appellate proceedings.

 

50               The parallel between s. 44(e)
of the Interpretation Act and s. 11 (i) of the Charter  had
in fact been previously drawn in Re McCutcheon and City of Toronto
(1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 193 (Ont. H.C.), where Linden J. remarked at p. 208
that s. 11 (i) of the Charter  ""entrenches"" s. 44(e)
of the Interpretation Act.  Consequently, it is in my opinion
inconsistent to hold that s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act
extends the right to the benefit of a lesser sanction further than s.
11 (i) of the Charter .  It in fact appears antithetical to
conclude that s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act can be deemed to
afford greater protection than the analogous constitutional guarantee it
inspired.

 

Policy Considerations

 

51               As noted in Re McCutcheon and
City of Toronto, supra, at p. 208, s. 44(e) of the Interpretation
Act can be described as an expression of the right to the benefit of a
lesser sanction when legislation is amended.  Many policy considerations come
into play when determining the extent to which such a right can be applied.

 

52               First, one should be mindful of
the consequences an overly broad interpretation can have here in terms of
frivolous appeals.  I am of the opinion that the provisions of s. 44(e)
of the Interpretation Act must not be interpreted in a way that
encompasses appellate review, namely because any other conclusion encourages
properly sentenced accuseds to lodge frivolous appeals in the hopes that the
law will change by the time their appeal is heard.

 

53               The second reason for which the right
to the benefit of a lesser sanction provided for by s. 44(e) of the Interpretation
Act should not be extended beyond trial sentencing is one of common sense
as well as of policy: a person charged with an offence should be subject to the
punishment that the Code carried for that offence at the time the
offence was committed.  Since no one is presumed to ignore the law, the person
who commits an offence must be presumed to have known of the punishment that
same offence entails.  In light of this presumption, it seems illogical that an
appeal should have the effect of varying the applicable law with regards to
sentencing.  The fact that an appeal is lodged or not should be
inconsequential.

 

54               Once it is recognized that the
applicable law here is the law as it stood at the time of trial sentencing
(i.e., the law as it stood at the time the offence was committed), it follows
that statutory amendments that provide for stricter sanctions should not
apply on appeals from sentence for the very same reason.  To conclude
otherwise, whether a statutory amendment provides for a stricter sanction or a
lesser one, inevitably means that accuseds who have been properly sentenced for
the same offence at the same time and on the basis of the law as it stood at
the time of sentencing, will ultimately be afforded different sentencing
treatment depending on whether they decide to lodge an appeal or not.  The law
should not favour such a result.  Rather, when a reasonable interpretation can
accommodate such concerns, it must be preferred.

 

55               A final consideration here relates
to the role of appellate courts in the context of sentencing.  More
particularly, the right to the benefit of a lesser sanction provided for by s.
44(e) of the Interpretation Act must be considered in conjunction
with s. 687 of the Code which deals with powers of courts of appeal
regarding sentence appeals.  Section 687(1) of the Code provides that
""[w]here an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall,
unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence
appealed against . . . .""  It is well established that the role of
appellate courts is to determine whether there has been an error on the part of
the trial judge.  In the absence of error, appellate courts must refrain from
intervening.

 

56               In other words, once sentence is properly
rendered at trial, an amended statutory provision proclaimed thereafter cannot
be substituted for the former relevant statutory provision, notwithstanding
appeal from the trial decision.  This interpretation, as Griffiths J.A. pointed
out in R. v. Luke, supra, is more consistent with the role of
appellate courts which, notably in the context of sentencing, is more akin to
review.

 

57               In the case at hand, no error was
committed by the trial judge.  The prohibition order was mandatory and the
trial judge here correctly applied the former version of s. 100 of the Code
on its terms.  This former version of s. 100 of the Code was perfectly valid
at the time the trial judge pronounced the sentence.  Given that Parliament has
in no way indicated that the amendment to s. 100 of the Code should
apply to persons appealing a sentence rendered by virtue of the former version
of s. 100 of the Code, the applicable law here is the law as it stood at
the time of trial sentencing.

 

58               The absence of any trial error
here also means that the ""in the system"" rule articulated in R. v.
Wigman, supra, is of no assistance to the appellant.  This rule
allows an accused who is still ""in the system"" at the appeal stage to
benefit from an interpretation of law that has been developed by the Supreme
Court after the conviction at trial.  This rule was developed on the basis that
the previous interpretation of the law was erroneous.  Again, this is
altogether different from the case at hand in which the trial judge properly
applied the statutory law to which he was bound, i.e., s. 100 of the Code
as it stood at the time of the appellant's sentencing.

 

59               Finally, the issue of a
constitutional exemption need not be addressed here as it has not been
demonstrated that the sentence imposed under the former s. 100 of the Code
constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of s.
12  of the Charter .

 

60               In the result, I would dismiss the
appeal and uphold the mandatory prohibition order required by virtue of s. 100
of the Code as it stood at the time of sentencing.

of Appeal erred in standard of appellate review it applied ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 687(1) .

 

                   The accused pleaded
guilty to second degree murder.  The offence was committed at his home during a
marijuana transaction.  Without any warning, the accused shot the deceased
three times in the chest as they were about to enter the garage to complete the
deal.  Two days later, the accused gave himself up to the police.  He professed
remorse for his actions but was unwilling or unable to explain them.  No motive
for the killing was ever ascertained.  The accused has a prior criminal record
including two convictions in Youth Court for robbery, a conviction for impaired
driving, and two narcotic offences as an adult.  Section 742 (b) of the Criminal
Code  specifies a sentence of life imprisonment with a period of parole
ineligibility of between 10 and 25 years for a person convicted of second
degree murder.  By virtue of their discretionary power under s. 744 , trial
judges may extend the period of parole ineligibility beyond the 10‑year
minimum.  The accused was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility
for parole for 12 years.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, allowed
his appeal against sentence, and reduced the period of parole ineligibility to
10 years.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and the trial judge's order restored.

 

                   The factors to be
considered in fixing an extended period of parole ineligibility under
s. 744  are (1) the character of the offender, (2) the nature of
the offence, and (3) the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence, all bearing in mind the discretionary power conferred on the trial
judge.  While an assessment of future dangerousness and denunciation are of
relevance in justifying a s. 744  order, deterrence is also a relevant
criterion.  The conclusion, by the majority of the Court of Appeal, that a
period of parole ineligibility in excess of 10 years will not be justified
unless there are ""unusual circumstances"" is too high a standard and
makes it overly difficult for trial judges to exercise their discretionary
power.  A more appropriate standard is that as a general rule, the period of
parole ineligibility should be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a
determination of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in
s. 744 , the offender should wait a longer period before having his
suitability to be released into the general public assessed.  To this end, an
extension of the period of parole ineligibility would not be
""unusual"", although in the median number of cases, a period of 10
years might still be awarded.  This standard is supported by a review of the
legislative history, academic commentary and judicial interpretation of
s. 744  and the sentencing scheme for second degree murder.  Permitting
trial judges to extend the period of parole ineligibility does not usurp or
impinge upon the function of the parole board.

 

                   The trial judge
made no error in this case.  He adverted to the fact that the accused had
pleaded guilty and was only 23 years old, and referred to the following
factors as specifically justifying the 12‑year period of parole
ineligibility he was imposing:  (a) the circumstances of the killing were
strange in that they provided no real answer to why it took place, and the
accused was unwilling or unable to explain his actions; (b) the murder was
committed during the course of committing another offence, namely a drug
transaction; and (c) the accused has a record for both narcotic offences
and violence.  Factors (b) and (c) clearly fall within the categories
established by s. 744 .  While factor (a) presents some difficulty, the
silence referred to is readily assimilable within the ""circumstances
surrounding the offence"" criterion.  In the absence of any explanation for
a random and seemingly senseless killing, the trial judge was correct in
sentencing the accused as he did in light of the accused's refusal to offer an
explanation.  The right to silence, which is fully operative in the
investigative and prosecutorial stages of the criminal process, wanes in
importance in the post‑conviction phase when sentencing is at issue.  It
should be emphasized, however, that the accused pleaded guilty; the question of
drawing a negative inference from the accused's silence when he or she has
pleaded not guilty and wishes to appeal the conviction should be left for
future consideration.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
erred in suggesting that an appellate court should reduce the period of parole
ineligibility imposed by the trial judge unless the trial judge has given
specific reasons which, in the opinion of the appeal court, justify the
increased period.  This very broad standard of review is inappropriate.  Orders
made under s. 744  are part of the ""sentence"" and are thus to be
appealed pursuant to s. 687(1) , which provides for consideration of the
""fitness"" of the sentence.  An appellate court should not be given
free reign to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a
different order ought to have been made.  A variation in the sentence should
only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not fit, that is, if it
has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.  In this case the sentencing
order did not fall outside the acceptable range of orders.

J. -- This appeal was allowed on June 15, 1995, with reasons to follow.
These are those reasons.

 

II.                At issue in this appeal are the
factors and principles that should guide a trial judge in determining whether
to extend the period of parole ineligibility on a second degree murder
conviction beyond the statutory minimum of 10 years.  This appeal also touches
on the appropriate standard of appellate review to be exercised when
considering a trial judge's decision to postpone the period of parole
eligibility.  Both of these issues engage the broad theme of when the discretion
of a sentencing judge ought to be altered.                           

 

I.  Background

 

III.               The respondent, Michael Thomas
Shropshire, pleaded guilty to the second degree murder of Timothy Buffam.  The
offence was committed at the respondent's home in Abbotsford, British Columbia,
on May 26, 1992, during a marijuana transaction between the respondent, the
deceased, and Lorne Lang, a third person accompanying the deceased.  Lang is
otherwise known as ""Animal"".  The respondent was acquainted with
Buffam and Lang as the trio had had prior narcotics dealings.  Without any
warning, the respondent shot Buffam three times in the chest as they were about
to enter the garage to complete the marijuana deal.  The respondent then chased
Lang in his vehicle shouting ""Hacksaw told me to do it!"".  Hacksaw is
the nickname of another associate.

 

IV.              Two days later, the respondent gave
himself up to the police.  After a preliminary hearing, the respondent pleaded
guilty to second degree murder.  He professed remorse for his actions but was
unwilling or unable to explain them. No motive for the killing was ever
ascertained.  The respondent has a prior criminal record including two
convictions in Youth Court for robbery, a conviction for impaired driving, and
two narcotic offences as an adult.

 

V.                On June 17, 1993, McKinnon J. of
the Supreme Court of British Columbia sentenced the respondent to life
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 12 years.  This period of
non-eligibility for parole is two years more than the minimum (and most common)
period of parole ineligibility for second degree murder, namely 10 years. 
Trial judges are permitted, by virtue of the discretionary power accorded to
them by s. 744  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , to extend
the period of parole ineligibility beyond the statutory minimum.  The
respondent challenged the discretionary s. 744  decision of the trial judge.

 

VI.              On May 4, 1994, a majority of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed the respondent's appeal against
sentence, and reduced the period of parole ineligibility to 10 years: (1994) 90
C.C.C. (3d) 234, 45 B.C.A.C. 252, 72 W.A.C. 252.  Goldie J.A. dissented and
would have dismissed the appeal.

 

II.  Relevant Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                   744. 
Subject to section
744.1, at the time of the sentencing under paragraph 742(b) of an
offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at
the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of
the same court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature
of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the
recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 743 , by order, substitute for
ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more
than twenty-five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the
circumstances.

 

VII.             Section 744.1 applies to offenders
under the age of 18.  Section 742 (b) specifies a sentence of life
imprisonment with a period of parole ineligibility of at least 10 years and not
more than 25 years for a person convicted of second degree murder.  Section 743 
relates to a recommendation by a jury as to minimum parole ineligibility.

 

III.  Judgments Below

 

A.                Supreme Court of
British Columbia

 

VIII.            McKinnon J. stated that it was the
duty of a trial judge ""to consider the appropriate sentence having regard
to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence, and the
circumstances surrounding its commission"".  He then concluded.

 

                   The
accused pleaded guilty to second degree murder and I have imposed the mandatory
sentence of life imprisonment.  It remains to determine the period he must
serve before eligibility for parole.

                   I have the joint submission of
Crown and defence that it should be the minimum prescribed, namely ten years. 
Notwithstanding that submission it is the duty of the trial judge to consider
the appropriate sentence having regard to the character of the offender, the
nature of the offence, and the circumstances surrounding its commission.  

 

                   This
offence was committed during a marijuana transaction between three people who
had prior similar dealings and who were certainly known to one another.  The
accused was selling a quantity of marijuana to one Lang.  The deceased, Buffam,
was along as both driver and co‑purchaser but appears to have been a
minor player insofar as this transaction was concerned.  It was set up between
Shropshire and Lang.

 

                   There
is some indication that Shropshire anticipated trouble with Lang as he owed him
$1,400, but the evidence is equivocal as Lang claims they were warmly greeted
by Shropshire when they arrived.  In any event, according to Lang, nothing
transpired while there to cause Mr. Shropshire to fire three bullets into
Buffam.  Mr. Shropshire professes remorse for his actions but seems unwilling
to explain just why he killed Mr. Buffam.

                   Lang
says that for reasons completely foreign to him, Shropshire fired three shots
into Buffam as they were all about to enter the garage to complete the
marijuana deal.  Shropshire then chased Lang with his vehicle, and depending
upon whose version you accept it was either to get him to come back to the
house and phone the police or to kill him as well.  Independent witnesses noted
the car chase but only Lang could say that Shropshire attempted to shoot him in
this chase.  Various shouts by Shropshire to Lang about ""Hacksaw told me
to do it"" were made.  Hacksaw is apparently the nickname of another
associate.  It is all very strange, made even stranger by Mr. Shropshire's
unwillingness or inability to explain his actions.

                   Mr. Shropshire is only twenty‑three
years old but has a criminal record for both narcotic offences and offences of
violence.  He has the support of both his parents and his wife with whom he has
two children.  He appears to have been involved in the criminal element for
most of his young years, and while I would not want to unduly affect what must
be a life that is still very much capable of reformation, given the factors
which I must consider, balanced against the facts, I believe the period of
ineligibility must be for twelve years.  I so impose such period.

 

B.British
Columbia Court of Appeal (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 234

 

IX.              The majority of the court allowed
the appeal against sentence and reduced the period of parole ineligibility to
10 years.

 

                   (i)    per
Lambert J.A. (Cumming J.A. concurring)

 

X.                Lambert J.A. found it hard to
conceive that ""the sentencing principles of general deterrence and
specific deterrence should have any application in setting a period of
ineligibility of parole of longer than 10 years"" (p. 237).  He stated that
if someone was not deterred by the thought of a life sentence coupled with
ineligibility for parole for a period of 10 years, then it was hard to conceive
that extending the period of ineligibility for parole would have any deterrent
effect on that person.

 

XI.              Lambert J.A. found that the effect
of an order imposing a period of parole ineligibility longer than 10 years was
to prevent the parole board from exercising ""the very function it is
designed to perform"" (p. 238).  To this end, so as not to usurp the
function of the parole board, such an order could only be issued in unusual
circumstances.  More specifically, the extended period of the parole
ineligibility order could only be based upon two justifications.  First, if
""the judge forms the impression that the convicted person is dangerous if
left at large and will continue to be dangerous after the passage of 10 years
and that the evidence at trial is such that the judge considers that he has a
clearer view of the danger of the person in question than the parole board will
have in 10 years time, when the relevance of the question of danger becomes
significant at all"" (p. 238).  Second, when denunciation is of the
essence:  ""a conclusion that a sentence of life imprisonment coupled with
parole ineligibility for a period of 10 years is an insufficient denunciation
by society, having regard to the gravity of the offence"" (p. 238).

 

XII.             Lambert J.A. then concluded that
neither of these reasons justified McKinnon J.'s decision to extend the period
of parole ineligibility in this case. With respect to dangerousness, Lambert
J.A. observed that McKinnon J. had failed to give sufficient reasons for
forming his opinion.  Regarding denunciation, Lambert J.A. held (at pp. 238-39):

 

. .
. in imposing such a denunciatory sentence...the cost of keeping him in for
extra years is in excess of $50,000 a year...and...in imposing extra years of
parole ineligibility it must be concluded that the extra denunciation is worth
more than $50,000 a year to society.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   I
cannot fit the reason given by the sentencing judge, namely, that there was no
explanation given by the accused when he pleaded guilty about why he committed
this murder, within the two categories which I have mentioned.  I do not think
that reason comes either in the first category of dangerousness, or within the
second category of denunciation.

 

. .
. . I think it is a relevant circumstance that both Crown counsel and defence
counsel, in their submissions to the sentencing judge, submitted that a period
of parole ineligibility of 10 years as required by the Code was the
appropriate period.  

 

                   I
consider in this case that a period of parole ineligibility of 10 years meets
the goals of Parliament in enacting these provisions.  I do not think there was
any unusual circumstance in this case...which would justify an increase.

 

                   (ii)   per
Goldie J.A. (dissenting)

 

XIII.            Goldie J.A. held that the Criminal
Code  requires a trial judge to consider the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the crime.  Goldie J.A. stated that the effect of the
respondent's refusal to disclose the circumstances surrounding the incident
""blocks at the threshold a meaningful consideration of the reasons for his
anti-social behaviour, that is to say, for an act the foreseeable consequence
of which was death -- the very epitome of anti-social behaviour""
(p. 241).  He concluded therefore that the respondent's silence was of
relevance in justifying the imposition of a longer period of parole ineligibility
(at p. 241):

 

                   In
my view, in the absence of any explanation, a virtually random, certainly
irrational on the face of it, and senseless taking of a life should put this
behaviour at the upper end, not the lower end of the offence of second degree
murder.  Furthermore, in the absence of an explanation it was entirely open to
the sentencing judge to treat the earlier convictions of robbery and armed
robbery, although committed six years before, as offences of violence.  I take
from that, he treated this offence as continuing evidence of a propensity. 
Indeed, there was nothing that would have allowed him to treat the killing here
as the aberration of the moment.  

 

                   In
my view, the deliberate refusal to offer an explanation for the occurrence of
such a serious offence is a circumstance in itself which should be treated as
sufficiently unusual as to justify an increased period of ineligibility. 
Silence after the plea of guilty is not the same thing as silence before
conviction.

 

XIV.            Goldie J.A. added that the reason for
protecting the right to remain silent disappeared with the plea of guilty.  The
respondent could not expect to be rewarded for remaining silent in the
sentencing circumstances.  Goldie J.A. then concluded that the trial judge did
not err with respect to the enhanced period of parole ineligibility (at p.
242):

 

He
[the trial judge] took cognizance of the factors he was bound to consider in
the unusual circumstance that the [respondent] chose to create.  He did not
impose a period that suggested he was substituting first degree murder for what
occurred.  He took into account the character, lifestyle, and age of the
accused so far as he could do so in the absence of any cooperation from the
[respondent].  He considered the mitigating circumstances so far as he was
informed of them.  In my view, the added two year period was fit and I would
have dismissed the appeal.

 

IV.  Issues on Appeal

 

XV.             I would state the issues in the
following manner:

 

1.What
are the appropriate factors for a sentencing judge to consider in determining
whether a period of parole ineligibility of longer than 10 years should be
awarded for an individual convicted of second degree murder?

 

2.Given the discretionary nature of an extended
period of parole ineligibility order under s. 744  of the Criminal Code ,
what is the appropriate standard of appellate review of such an order?

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.What
are the appropriate factors for a sentencing judge to consider in determining
whether a period of parole ineligibility of longer than 10 years should be
awarded for an individual convicted of second degree murder?

 

XVI.            The majority of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal held that there are only two factors to consider in
justifying an enhanced period of parole ineligibility: (1) an assessment of
future dangerousness, and (2) denunciation. With respect, I disagree.  Although
these factors are of relevance in justifying an extension of the period of
parole ineligibility, they are by no means determinative or exclusive.

 

XVII.          Section 744  of the Criminal Code 
authorizes a trial judge to impose a period of parole ineligibility greater
than the minimum 10-year period. This provision, which governs this appeal,
reads as follows: 

 

                   744. 
Subject to section
744.1, at the time of the sentencing under paragraph 742(b) of an
offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at
the trial of the offender . . . may, having regard to the character of the
offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its
commission . . . substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment
(being more than ten but not more than twenty-five) without eligibility for
parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances. [Emphasis added.]

 

XVIII.         The determination under s. 744  is thus a
very fact-sensitive process. The factors to be considered in fixing an extended
period of parole ineligibility are:

 

(1)
the character of the offender;

 

(2)
the nature of the offence; and

 

(3)
the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;

 

all bearing in mind the discretionary
power conferred on the trial judge.

 

XIX.            No reference is made to denunciation
or assessments of future dangerousness in the statutory language.  By elevating
""denunciation"" and ""assessment of future dangerousness"" as
the only criteria by which extended periods of parole ineligibility can be
determined, the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal has, in
effect, judicially amended the clear statutory language.  This is not to say,
however, that these two criteria should not be part of the analysis.  For
example, ""denunciation"" can fall within the statutory criterion of
the ""nature of the offence"".  Similarly,  ""future
dangerousness"" can fall within the rubric of the ""character of the offender"".

 

XX.             On the issue of denunciation,
Lambert J.A. stated that it would not provide a valid basis for ordering a
longer period of parole ineligibility unless it is ""concluded that the
extra denunciation is worth more than $50,000 a year to society"" (p.
239).  I cannot accept that position.  It is entirely inappropriate to require
a trial judge to engage in such a cost/benefit budgetary analysis.  As
submitted by the appellant before this Court:

 

The
question of how society allocates public resources is for Parliament to
determine.  By enacting s. 744 , Parliament has determined that some of
society's resources will be allocated to imprisoning convicted murderers beyond
the ten year point.  If Parliament determines that the fiscal cost of that
incarceration is too high, then they can amend s. 744 .  It is not the task of
individual judges carrying out the sentencing process to engage in that kind of
budgetary analysis.

 

Furthermore, this sort of fiscal
analysis would yield undesirable results from a policy perspective.

 

XXI.            ""Deterrence"" is also a
relevant criterion in justifying a s. 744  order. Parole eligibility informs the
content of the ""punishment"" meted out to an offender: for example,
there is a very significant difference between being behind bars and
functioning within society while on conditional release.  Consequently, I
believe that lengthened periods of parole ineligibility could reasonably be
expected to deter some persons from reoffending.  Such is also the position of
a variety of provincial appellate courts, from which the British Columbia Court
of Appeal presently diverges: R. v. Wenarchuk (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 169
(Sask. C.A.); R. v. Mitchell (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (N.S.C.A.); R.
v. Young (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 538 (N.S.C.A.); R. v. Able (1993),
65 O.A.C. 37 (C.A.); R. v. Ly (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (Man. C.A.), per
Twaddle J.A. (Scott C.J.M. concurring), at p. 61:  ""Parliament's purpose
in adding a minimum period of parole ineligibility to a life sentence was, in
my view, twofold.  It was to deter and denounce the crime"".

 

XXII.          More importantly, the British Columbia
Court of Appeal's position is also irreconcilable with the view taken by this
Court of the interplay between parole eligibility and deterrence.  For example,
in R. v. Arkell, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 695, at p. 704 it was stated:

 

. .
. the distinction between first and second degree murder . . . is a maximum
extra fifteen years that must be served before one is eligible for parole . . .
.  Parliament's decision to treat more seriously murders that have been
committed while the offender is exploiting a position of power through illegal
domination of the victim [i.e. first degree murder] accords with the
principle that there must be a proportionality between a sentence and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender and other considerations such as deterrence and
societal condemnation of the acts of the offender.  [Emphasis added.]

 

XXIII.         The only difference in terms of
punishment between first and second degree murder is the duration of parole
ineligibility.  This clearly indicates that parole ineligibility is part of the
""punishment"" and thereby forms an important element of sentencing
policy.  As such, it must be concerned with deterrence, whether general or
specific.  The jurisprudence of this Court is clear that deterrence is a
well-established objective of sentencing policy.  In R. v. Lyons, 
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, La Forest J. held at p. 329:

 

In a
rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention,
deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of
the crime and the circumstances of the offender.  No one would suggest that any
of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate
purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.

 

Section 744  must be concerned with all
of the factors cited in Lyons.  In R. v. Luxton, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
711, the importance of structuring sentences to take into account the
individual accused and the particular crime was emphasized.  This is also a
factor that any order made pursuant to s. 744  ought to take into consideration.

 

XXIV.         The exercise of a trial judge's
discretion under s. 744  should not be more strictly circumscribed than the
sentencing itself.  The section does not embody any limiting statutory
language; rather it is quite the contrary.  In its terms, it is very similar
to  s. 745, which permits an application to be made to reduce the parole
ineligibility period after 15 years of incarceration.  Section 745 has recently
been given judicial scrutiny by this Court in R. v. Swietlinski, [1994]
3 S.C.R. 481.  That case involved an assessment of the relevant considerations
for a jury hearing a s. 745 application; Lamer C.J. concluded at p. 500:

 

It
is true that deterrence is one of the functions of the penalty and that it is
therefore legitimate for the jury to take this factor into account when hearing
an application under s. 745.

 

There is no reason why the functions
of s. 744  should be given a more restrictive interpretation than those of s.
745.

 

XXV.          In any event, independent of the effect
that parole ineligibility may empirically have on recidivism, Lambert J.A.'s
reasoning, in both this case as well as in R. v. Hogben (1994), 40
B.C.A.C. 257, completely precludes the concept of ""deterrence"" from
informing the decision of whether or not to extend the period of parole
ineligibility.  This in my view constitutes an unduly restrictive
interpretation of s. 744  and erroneously contravenes the jurisprudence of this
court as well as other appellate courts.

 

XXVI.         I also find it necessary to deal with
Lambert J.A.'s conclusion that a period of parole ineligibility in excess of 10
years will not be justified unless there are ""unusual
circumstances"".  This conclusion resonates in the earlier decisions of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Brown (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d)
394, and R. v. Gourgon (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 193.  In my opinion, this
is too high a standard and makes it overly difficult for trial judges to
exercise the discretionary power to set extended periods of parole
ineligibility.  The language of s. 744  does not require ""unusual
circumstances"".  As a result, to so require by judicial pronouncement runs
contrary to Parliamentary intent.

 

XXVII.        In my opinion, a more appropriate
standard, which would better reflect the intentions of Parliament, can be
stated in this manner: as a general rule, the period of parole ineligibility
shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination of the trial
judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in s. 744 , the offender should
wait a longer period before having his suitability to be released into the general
public assessed.  To this end, an extension of the period of parole
ineligibility would not be ""unusual"", although it may well be that,
in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be awarded.

 

XXVIII.      I am supported in this conclusion by a
review of the legislative history, academic commentary, and judicial
interpretation of s. 744 , and the sentencing scheme for second degree murder.

 

XXIX.         Section 742(b) of the Code
provides that a person sentenced to life imprisonment for second degree murder
shall not be eligible for parole ""until he has served at least ten years
of his sentence or such greater number of years, not being more than
twenty-five years, as has been substituted therefor pursuant to section
744 "".  In permitting a sliding scale of parole ineligibility, Parliament
intended to recognize that, within the category of second degree murder, there
will be a broad range of seriousness reflecting varying degrees of moral
culpability.  As a result, the period of parole ineligibility for second degree
murder will run anywhere between a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 25, the
latter being equal to that prescribed for first degree murder.  The mere fact
that the median period gravitates towards the 10-year minimum does not, ipso
facto, mean that any other period of time is ""unusual"".

 

XXX.          I should pause to repeat that in the
instant appeal we are concerned with a period of parole ineligibility for
second degree murder of 12 years, this being only two years more than the
minimum.

 

XXXI.         If the objective of s. 744  is to give
the trial judge an element of discretion in sentencing to reflect the fact that
within second degree murder there is both a range of seriousness and varying
degrees of moral culpability, then it is incorrect to start from the
proposition that the sentence must be the statutory minimum unless there are
unusual circumstances.  As discussed supra, a preferable approach would
be to view the 10-year period as a minimum contingent on what the ""judge
deems fit in the circumstances"", the content of this ""fitness""
being informed by the criteria listed in s. 744 .  As held in other Canadian
jurisdictions, the power to extend the period of parole ineligibility need not
be sparingly used.

 

XXXII.        For example, in R. v. Wenarchuk, supra,
the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal (per Bayda C.J.S. for a five-judge
panel) held at p. 173 that: 

 

[It
is no longer appropriate] that the `order (increasing the parole
non-eligibility period) should be sparingly made'.  The order should be made
whenever such an order is `fit in the circumstances'. [Emphasis added.]

 

XXXIII.      I would equally affirm the following
passage from the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Doyle
(1991), 108 N.S.R. (2d) 1, at p. 5, leave to appeal to this Court refused,
[1992] 2 S.C.R. vi, which I find apposite to the present discussion:

 

                   The
Code does not fix the sentence for second degree murder as life
imprisonment with no parole eligibility for ten years.  The discretion 
conferred on the sentencing judge by s. 742 (b) and s. 744  is not whether to
move from a prima facie period of ten years, but rather what is a fit sentence,
applying the proper guidelines.  Unusual circumstances are not the prerequisite
for moving away from the ten year minimum, although as the cases illustrate,
they certainly play a role in the proper exercise of the judicial discretion
. . . .

 

It
is not the law that unusual circumstances, brutality, torture or a bad record
must be demonstrated before the judge may exercise his discretion to move above
the ten years minimum.  Nor is there any burden on the Crown to demonstrate
that the period should be more than the minimum.  [Emphasis added.]

 

XXXIV.      On another note, I do not find that
permitting trial judges to extend the period of parole ineligibility usurps or
impinges upon the function of the parole board.  I am cognizant of the fact
that, upon the expiry of the period of parole ineligibility, there is no
guarantee of release into the public.  At that point, it is incumbent upon the
parole board to assess the suitability of such release, and in so doing it is
guided by the legislative objectives of the parole system: see ss. 101  and 102 
of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 . 
However, it is clear that the parole board is not the only participant in the
parole process.  All it is designed to do is, within the parameters defined by
the judiciary, decide whether an offender can be released.  A key component of
those parameters is the determination of when the period of parole eligibility
(i.e. when the parole board can commence its administrative review function)
starts to run. This is the manner in which the system is geared to function --
with complementary yet distinct input from both the judiciary and the parole
administrators.  It is the role of the sentencing judge to circumscribe, in
certain statutorily defined circumstances, the operation of the parole board. 
The decision of McKinnon J. in the case at bar neither skews this balance nor
unduly trumps the function of the parole board.  As noted by the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal in Wenarchuk, supra, at pp. 172-73: 

 

                   The
object of the provision in s. 671 [now s. 744 ] is not to take away from the
Parole Board, or in some way diminish, the Board's function to determine
whether the accused is sufficiently rehabilitated (from the standpoint of risk
to and the protection of society) to permit his release into society . . . .  The
object, rather, is to give back to the judge some of the discretion he normally
has in the matter of sentencing -- discretion that the statute took away from
him when it provided for a life sentence [for murder] -- so that the judge may
do justice, not retributive or punitive justice, but justice to reflect the
accused's culpability and to better express society's repudiation for the
particular crime committed by the particular accused (with that repudiation's
attendant beneficial consequences for society, including its protection through
individual and general deterrence and, where necessary, segregation from
society)....

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

An
order under s. 671 does not impinge upon the powers of the Board.  At most, it
has the effect of postponing the Board's exercise of its powers -- its
full powers.  [Emphasis in original.]

XXXV.       

                   Applying these
legal principles to the particular facts of this case, I do not see any error
on the part of the trial judge. He adverted to the fact that the respondent had
pleaded guilty and was only 23 years old.  He recognized that the Crown was not
seeking a period of parole ineligibility beyond the minimum.  Nevertheless, in
a legitimate exercise of his discretionary power, and after correctly reviewing
the factors set out in s. 744 , he imposed a 12-year period of parole
ineligibility.  He referred to the following factors as specifically justifying
the 12-year period of parole ineligibility:

 

(a)the
circumstances of the killing were strange in that they provided no real answer
to why it took place, and the respondent was unwilling or unable to explain his
actions;

 

(b)
the murder was committed during the course of committing another offence,
namely a drug transaction; and

 

(c)
the respondent has a record for both narcotic offences and violence.

 

XXXVI.      Factors (b) and (c) clearly fall within the
categories (""character"", ""nature"" and ""circumstances
surrounding"") established by s. 744 .  As to factor (b), I further note
that the Manitoba Court of Appeal, in R. v. Ly, supra,  held that
the period of parole ineligibility could be increased when the murder is
committed in the course of another crime, particularly a crime of violence.

 

XXXVII.     Factor (a), however, presents some
difficulty.  The respondent raises the question whether the trial judge erred
in interpreting the respondent's silence in such a manner as to justify
extending the period of parole ineligibility.

 

XXXVIII.    In response, I would affirm the analysis of
Goldie J.A. in the court below (at pp. 241-42) and would hold that this silence
is readily assimilable within the ""circumstances surrounding the
offence"" criterion.  The crux of Goldie J.A.'s comments is that, in the
absence of any explanation for a random and seemingly senseless killing, the
trial judge was correct in sentencing the respondent in light of his refusal to
offer an explanation. It was found that his refusal was deliberate and in and
of itself unusual.  After all, the respondent, a drug dealer with previous
convictions for robbery and armed robbery, shot the victim Buffam in cold blood
without provocation of any kind.

 

XXXIX.      It is not for the trial judge to speculate
what the respondent might have said to mitigate the severity of the offence.  I
quite agree with Goldie J.A. that the right to silence, which is fully
operative in the investigative and prosecutorial stages of the criminal
process, wanes in importance in the post-conviction phase when sentencing is at
issue.  However, in so agreeing, I emphasize that the respondent pleaded
guilty; I leave for future consideration the question of drawing a negative
inference from the silence of the accused when he or she has pleaded not guilty
and wishes to appeal the conviction.  In the case at bar, the trial judge even
went so far as to invite the accused to suggest why he may have committed the
offence, but no response was forthcoming.  As held by Goldie J.A. (at p. 242),
the respondent ""cannot expect to be rewarded for remaining silent in the
circumstances"".  The court and the public clearly have an interest in
knowing why a human life was taken by an offender.

 

XL.             Goldie J.A.'s comments and the
decision of the trial judge on the ""silence"" issue are fully
consonant with the position taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal.  In R. v.
Able, supra, the Court of Appeal increased two co-accused's periods
of parole ineligibility.  At page 39 it was held:

 

                   No
explanation has been forthcoming from either of the appellants with respect to
the reason for the killing ... [which] can be best described as a callous,
brutal, pointless, execution-style killing of a helpless victim.

 

I conclude that in certain
circumstances, such as those presented in this case, it is proper to take into
account the absence of an explanation of attenuating factors.

 

 

 

XLI.            The respondent suggests that Goldie
J.A.'s comments and the decision of the trial judge contravene the
pronouncements of this Court in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.  I
recognize that, in Gardiner, this Court extended certain procedural
rights to sentencing proceedings.  However, these were limited to the right to
counsel, the right to call evidence, the right to cross-examine and the right
to address the court.  There is no mention made of the creation in its
identical form of a substantive right such as the right to silence.

 

XLII.           At the sentencing stage, the Crown has
already proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the
crime for which he or she stood charged or, as in this appeal, the accused has
pleaded guilty to the offence; if the accused then seeks to receive the least
severe sentence commensurate with his or her conviction (i.e. for second degree
murder, life imprisonment with eligibility for parole after 10 years have
elapsed) it is incumbent upon the accused to play a somewhat active role in the
process.  I note that the right to silence is a manifestation of the
presumption of innocence: R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595; R. v.
Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151; R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293.
The presumption of innocence flows to those ""charged with an offence""
or suspected of having committed one; once an individual has been convicted of
an offence he or she is no longer simply ""charged"".

 

B.Given
the discretionary nature of an extended period of parole ineligibility order
under s. 744 of the Criminal Code, what is the appropriate standard of
appellate review of such an order?

 

XLIII.          In my view, the British Columbia Court
of Appeal not only erred in law regarding the factors justifying the issuance
of an extended period of parole ineligibility order, but also in the standard
of appellate review it espoused.

 

XLIV.         Lambert J.A. suggested that an appellate
court should reduce the period of parole ineligibility imposed by the trial
judge unless the trial judge has given specific reasons which, in the opinion
of the appeal court, justify the increased period.  This is a very broad
standard of review, focusing in an exact manner on the appellate court's
assessment of the correctness of the sentencing judge's decision.  In my
opinion, this standard of review is inappropriate.

 

XLV.           Orders made under s. 744 are defined
by s. 673 of the Code as forming part of the ""sentence"".  They
are thus to be appealed pursuant to the statutory right of appeal provided by
s. 687(1) of the Code.  Section 687(1)  reads as follows: 

 

                   687.
(1)  Where an
appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence
appealed against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require
or to receive,

 

(a) 
vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which
the accused was convicted; or

 

(b) 
dismiss the appeal. [Emphasis added.]

 

XLVI.         The question, then, is whether a
consideration of the ""fitness"" of a sentence incorporates the very
interventionist appellate review propounded by Lambert J.A.  With respect, I
find that it does not.  An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify
a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order ought to have
been made.  The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective
process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the
witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written
record.  A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal
is convinced it is not fit.  That is to say, that it has found the sentence to
be clearly unreasonable.

 

XLVII.        I would adopt the approach taken by the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in the cases of R. v. Pepin (1990), 98
N.S.R. (2d) 238, and R. v. Muise (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119. In Pepin,
at p. 251, it was held that:

 

. .
. in considering whether a sentence should be altered, the test is not whether
we would have imposed a different sentence; we must determine if the sentencing
judge applied wrong principles or [if] the sentence is clearly or manifestly
excessive.

 

XLVIII.       Further, in Muise it was held at
pp. 123-24 that:

 

                   In
considering the fitness of a sentence imposed by a trial judge, this court has
consistently held that it will not interfere unless the sentence imposed is
clearly excessive or inadequate....

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   The
law on sentence appeals is not complex.  If a sentence imposed is not clearly
excessive or inadequate it is a fit sentence assuming the trial judge applied
the correct principles and considered all relevant facts . . . .  My view is
premised on the reality that sentencing is not an exact science; it is anything
but. It is the exercise of judgment taking into consideration relevant legal
principles, the circumstances of the offence and the offender.  The most that
can be expected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within
an acceptable range.  In my opinion, that is the true basis upon which Courts
of Appeal review sentences when the only issue is whether the sentence is
inadequate or excessive.

 

XLIX.         For a similar approach, see  R. v.
Émond, Que. C.A., No. 200‑10‑000173-893, February 6, 1990, J.E.
90-557.

 

L.                Unreasonableness in the
sentencing process involves the sentencing order falling outside the
""acceptable range"" of orders; this clearly does not arise in the
present appeal.  An error of law involves a situation such as that found in R.
v. Chaisson, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1118, in which a sentencing judge, while
calculating the total time period of incarceration for the purposes of a
""half-time"" parole ineligibility order under s. 741.2 of the Code,
erroneously included two offences in the calculations notwithstanding the fact
that these specific offences were not listed in the schedule of offences to
which the s. 741.2 orders apply.

 

LI.               Regarding the issuance of reasons
for extending the period of parole ineligibility, it is clear that the provision
of reasons by the trial judge will help an appellate court assess the
reasonableness of the sentencing decision.  In a case where no reasons (either
oral or written) are issued, the appellate court may be more inclined to find
unreasonableness.  However, the fact that no reasons are given should not
automatically trigger a decision by appeal or appellate courts to reduce (or,
for the matter, increase) the period of parole ineligibility imposed by the
trial judge.  Generally, although it is always preferable, in a matter as
important as sentencing, for a trial judge to give reasons, a trial judge does
not err merely because no reasons are given for deciding one way or the other: R.
v. Smith, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 991; R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, at p.
664.  In any event, this discussion is, to a large extent, unnecessary in so
far as the instant appeal is concerned since McKinnon J. clearly indicated why
a period of 12 years was appropriate.

 

LII.              Interestingly, I note that the
deferential standard of appellate review of sentencing orders presently
propounded by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal had formerly been applicable in
British Columbia. In R. v. Gourgon, supra, Bull J.A. had held at
p. 197:

 

. .
. the matter is clearly one of discretion and unless patently wrong, or wrong
principles applied, or correct principles applied erroneously, or proper
factors ignored or overstressed, an appellate Court should be careful not to
interfere with the exercise of that discretion of a trial Judge.

 

LIII.            Gourgon was impliedly
overthrown by the pronouncements of Lambert J.A. in the instant appeal, which,
in turn, are traceable to R. v. Brown, supra,  and R. v.
Walford (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (B.C.C.A.), per Nemetz C.J.B.C. 
As can be gleaned from this discussion, I find Bull J.A.'s standard to be
preferable and better aligned with generally accepted jurisprudential
principles.  In this connection, on the issue of appellate review I would
reject Lambert J.A.'s pronouncements in the instant appeal to the extent that
they overturn Gourgon and diverge from Pepin and Muise.

 

VI.  Conclusions and Disposition

 

LIV.            The trial judge properly considered
the relevant factors in exercising the discretionary jurisdiction given to him
under s. 744.  The Court of Appeal erred in postulating an unduly restrictive
and narrow approach to s. 744 and by adopting a standard of appellate review
that was tantamount to substituting its opinion for that of the trial judge. 
Consequently, I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, and restore the trial judge's s. 744 order of a
period of parole ineligibility of 12 years.

ontario

                   The accused was
charged with sexual assault of the 15‑year‑old complainant V.  V
and her 14‑year‑old friend T had willingly gone with the accused
and another young man, who picked them up in the accused's car at a pizza store
at 1:30 a.m.  The accused drove to a parking lot behind an apartment
building, where the four consumed some beer and talked.  They went on to a
second parking lot, where the two girls exchanged seats.  The accused then
drove to a third lot, where he had sexual intercourse with V.  After this he
drove the two girls to T's home.  V testified that she resisted the accused's
advances throughout.  She stated that she told him ""no"" during
intercourse and tried to push him away.  She testified that although the
accused was not violent and the windows were open and the doors unlocked, she
was afraid to scream or try to escape.  A medical examination of V revealed
extensive genital bruising consistent with ""traumatic"" or ""very
forceful"" sexual intercourse.  In his defence, the accused maintained that
V had consented to the sexual intercourse.  He also argued that, in light of
V's denial that she had consented, circumstances were such that he had
entertained an honest but mistaken belief in consent.  The trial judge put this
defence to the jury, which acquitted him.  The Crown appealed, alleging that
the trial judge made four errors:  (1) he erred in his review of V's lack
of consent and in his treatment of the jury's question on this issue;
(2) he failed to instruct the jury that prior inconsistent statements not
adopted by the witness do not constitute evidence; (3) he mischaracterized
the medical evidence; and (4) he should not have left the defence of
honest but mistaken belief with the jury.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority
decision, upheld the acquittal.  All three judges were of the view that the
case was one of consent or no consent, and there was no air of reality to a
defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.  The majority of the court,
however, did not consider the trial judge's errors to be of such significance
that the acquittal should be set aside.  The dissenting judge would have
ordered a new trial.

 

                   Held (Major J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Cory, McLachlin
and Iacobucci JJ.:  The cumulative effect of the errors made at trial
requires that the appeal be allowed and a new trial ordered, despite the heavy
onus on the Crown when it seeks to have an acquittal set aside.  V's evidence
was clear that she had repeatedly said ""no"" to the accused and had
resisted the assault.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that her
statements to the police or her testimony at the preliminary hearing were
contradictory on this point.  The trial judge in his charge to the jury did not
mention V's resistance and incorrectly stated that she had not said
""no"" to the accused.  Since the sole issue was consent, this
constituted a serious error.  The jury were understandably confused by the
trial judge's erroneous direction, as indicated by the question they put to him
after an hour of deliberation.  The judge's response to this question in
essence told them they ought to try harder to remember the evidence, and this
was an inadequate response.  Combined with the other errors, its effect is
serious.  The second error is that the trial judge failed, as required by law,
to instruct the jury that V's prior inconsistent statements were admitted on
credibility only and not for the truth of their contents.  Some of the trial
judge's instructions suggested the prior statements could be relied on as
evidence of what had happened.  This erroneous direction constitutes a
significant error.  The third error lay in mischaracterizing the medical
evidence.  The trial judge suggested that the doctor's testimony that V
suffered genital bruising consistent with ""very forceful"" or
""traumatic"" intercourse might not be very relevant since the accused
admitted that intercourse had taken place.  In fact, the evidence of bruising
may have been relevant as an indication of lack of consent or resistance. 
Since consent was the only issue, this misdirection too assumes significance. 
Finally, the trial judge should not have left the defence of honest but
mistaken belief with the jury, since it was unsupported by the evidence.  The
trial judge in putting this defence to the jury relied on the fact that the
girls were out after midnight, that they willingly entered the car of the
accused, that they changed seats without trying to escape, that the windows of
the car were down and the doors unlocked and that the girls did not scream, as
well as on the erroneous conclusion that there was no evidence of verbal
complaint.  These circumstances did not provide the required air of reality. 
Since there is no way of knowing whether the jury acquitted because they had a
reasonable doubt about whether V consented, or whether they acquitted on the
basis of a defence which should not have been left with them, a new trial
should be ordered.  Absent the significant errors at trial, a reasonable jury
properly charged may well have reached a different verdict.

 

                   Per Sopinka J.:  A new trial should
be ordered by reason of the first three errors found by the Court of Appeal,
for the reasons given by McLachlin J.  The issue of honest but mistaken
belief, however, is not before the Court.

 

                   Per La Forest and Gonthier JJ.: 
A new trial should be ordered, for the reasons given by the dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal.  The defence of honest but mistaken belief is not before
the Court.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  A new
trial should be ordered, for the reasons given by the dissenting judge in the
Court of Appeal.  The defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent is not
before the Court since this is an appeal as of right, the Court of Appeal was
unanimous on that issue and no leave to appeal was granted.  In any event, as
regards that defence, the majority reasons in R. v. Park should be
referred to.  Major J.'s positions on both issues were strongly disagreed with.

 

                   Per Major J. (dissenting):  The
Crown has failed to satisfy the court to a reasonable certainty that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the jury been properly
instructed.  When the verdict at trial is an acquittal, the Crown appellant
does not benefit from the prima facie assumption that an error warrants
a new trial.  The onus is on the Crown from the outset to establish that the
errors complained of materially affected the verdict, such that a new trial is
justified.  There were clearly errors in the trial judge's charge to the jury. 
The trial judge incorrectly stated that V's evidence was that she did not come
out and say ""no"" exactly.  However, this error did not change the
outcome of the trial.  Immediately thereafter the trial judge admitted that he
might be mistaken and told the jury that it was their recollection of the
evidence, not his, which was important.  In addition, the jury's question
indicates that they understood the complainant's evidence to be that she said
no.  The trial judge did not err in denying the jury's request to have that
evidence replayed.  While any request for instruction or assistance from a jury
must be treated carefully, in the case where a jury wishes to have evidence
read or played again, problems can arise, especially in procedural fairness. 
Here the jury were not advised that they could not obtain assistance, but were
told they should make a further attempt on their own and that if this attempt
failed, assistance would be forthcoming.  With respect to the alleged improper
characterization of the medical evidence, the trial judge said that the jury
would have to consider this evidence as an indication of the force which must
have been used, and thus did not remove the evidence from their consideration
on the issue of consent.  The trial judge's failure to inform the jury that
prior inconsistent statements which had not been adopted by the witnesses could
be used only for assessing credibility was an error.  In this case, however,
the inconsistent statements were before the jury to test credibility and not
for any other purpose.  The final error alleged by the Crown is that the trial
judge put the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to the jury. 
While the factors listed by the trial judge as supporting the accused's
assertion of honest belief in consent do not provide an ""air of reality""
as required for the defence, this case was one of consent or no consent and
credibility was the key issue.  Since it is highly unlikely that the jury would
have decided the case based on honest but mistaken belief in consent, the
verdict would likely have been the same had that defence not been before the
jury.  The circumstances giving rise to the complaint were decisive.  The
cramped quarters in which the alleged sexual assault took place were such that
some co‑operation of the complainant was necessary.  This was consistent
with the accused's testimony and inconsistent with that of the complainant. 
The jury were aware of the circumstances and concluded that the accused
proceeded with consent, or at least they had a reasonable doubt about his guilt. 
This finding of fact represents the collective wisdom of the community as
expressed by the jury and should not be interfered with.

by Sheppard J. on a charge of sexual assault.  Appeal allowed and new
trial ordered, Major J. dissenting.

 

                   Susan L. Reid, for the appellant.

 

                   Lorne Levine, for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

I.                 McLachlin
J. -- Mr. Livermore is charged with sexual assault of a 15-year-old
girl, Valerie.  At the time of the alleged assault, Livermore was 28 years
old.  It is common ground that Valerie and her 14-year-old friend Tasha had
willingly gone with Livermore and another young man, the co-accused, who picked
them up in Livermore's car at an Oshawa pizza store at 1:30 a.m.  Livermore
drove to a parking lot behind an apartment building where the four consumed
some beer and talked.  Both Tasha and Valerie testified that Tasha asked to go
home after approximately 30 minutes; the accused stated that the four mutually
agreed to drive to another location.  Livermore drove past Tasha's building to
a second parking lot, where the two girls exchanged seats.  Livermore then
drove to a third parking lot where he had sexual intercourse with Valerie. 
After this he drove the two girls to Tasha's home.  

 

II.                Valerie testified that she
resisted Mr. Livermore's advances throughout.  She stated that although she
told the accused to stop kissing her and pushed him away, he climbed over the
gear shift, pulled her pants down and had sexual intercourse with her.  She
stated that she told him ""no"" during intercourse and tried to push
him away.  She testified that although the accused was not violent and the
windows were open and the doors unlocked, she was afraid to scream or try to
escape because in the movies ""people that don't say nothing, don't do
nothing, just get away"".  Valerie stated that when they arrived at Tasha's
apartment, Livermore hugged her.  Valerie said that it was possible that she
had hugged him back, before saying ""bye"".   When asked by counsel for
the accused why, on returning to Tasha's apartment building, she didn't run
into the apartment with Tasha to escape, she stated that she didn't because she
didn't want the men ""to know that anything was wrong"".

 

III.               The girls testified that on their
return to Tasha's home they locked themselves in the bathroom and concocted a
story to explain their absence to Tasha's mother.  They told Tasha's mother a
story that involved the presence of a third girl at the pizza store, whose threatening
manner had prompted them to go with Livermore and the co-accused for safety. 
They also told her that Valerie had been raped.  Valerie related the same story
in her first statement to the police later that morning.  She testified that
the only part of the story that was untrue was the explanation of how the girls
came to get into the car with Livermore and the co-accused.  Valerie says she
told her own mother the truth ""from the start"", at the hospital later
in the morning, and subsequently told the police the truth in a second
statement.  A medical examination of Valerie revealed extensive genital
bruising consistent with ""traumatic"" or ""very forceful""
sexual intercourse.

 

IV.              Livermore's testimony contradicted
Valerie's on the issue of consent.  He testified that Valerie had been a
willing partner while they mutually kissed and touched each other and that he
climbed over the gear shift onto her side of the car after she touched his leg
and penis.   He stated that Valerie lowered her own pants and underpants prior
to intercourse.  Livermore testified that on the way back to Tasha's apartment,
Tasha and Valerie discussed how they would explain their absence to Tasha's
mother.  He stated that Valerie hugged him before she left the car.  Livermore
also testified that he gave a slip of paper to Tasha on which he had written
his name and telephone number before she and Valerie switched places in the
car.  

 

V.                In his defence, Livermore
maintained that Valerie had consented to the sexual intercourse.  He also
argued that, in light of Valerie's denial that she had consented, circumstances
were such that he had entertained an honest but mistaken belief in consent. 
The trial judge put this defence to the jury, which  acquitted him and his
co-accused.  The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal: (1994), 18 O.R.
(3d) 221.  Abella J.A., dissenting, would have ordered a new trial.  

 

VI.              Both in the Court of Appeal and in
this Court, the Crown alleged that the trial judge made the following four
errors:  

 

(1)The
trial judge erred in his review of Valerie's lack of consent and in his
treatment of the jury's question on this issue;

 

(2)The
trial judge failed to instruct the jury that prior inconsistent statements not
adopted by the witness do not constitute evidence; 

 

(3)The
trial judge mischaracterized the medical evidence; and

 

(4)The
defence of honest but mistaken belief should not have been left with the jury.

 

VII.             In my view, the cumulative effect of
the errors made at trial requires that the appeal be allowed and a new trial
ordered, despite the heavy onus on the Crown when it seeks to have an acquittal
set aside.  

 

VIII.            With respect to the first alleged
error, Valerie's evidence was clear that she had repeatedly said ""no""
to Livermore and had resisted the assault.  There is nothing in the record to
indicate that her statements to the police or her testimony at the preliminary
hearing were contradictory on this point.  The contradiction with respect to
her saying ""no"" to the co-accused when he tried to kiss her does not
negate the consistency of her testimony with respect to Livermore.  The trial
judge in his charge to the jury did not mention Valerie's resistance and
incorrectly stated that she had not said ""no"" to Livermore.  Since
the sole issue was consent, this constituted a serious error.

 

IX.              The jury was understandably confused
by the trial judge's erroneous direction, as indicated by the question it put
to the judge after an hour of deliberation:

 

The
jury would like to hear evidence repeated with respect to the witness Valerie
... answering to both the Crown and the defence questioning about when
Valerie said, no, to Carson Livermore.  Further, can we also hear Valerie's
comments of, no, during the preliminary hearing?  [Emphasis added.]

 

The judge's response to this question
was accurately described by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal as, in
essence, telling them they ought to try harder to remember the evidence.  This
was an inadequate response to the jury's question, which indicated difficulty
on the main issue in the case -- consent.  Combined with the other errors, its
effect is serious.

 

X.                The second error is that the
trial judge failed, as required by law, to instruct the jury that Valerie's
prior inconsistent statements were admitted on credibility only and not for the
truth of their contents.  Some of the trial judge's instructions suggested the
prior statements could be relied on as evidence of what had happened.  Had
Valerie adopted the prior statements in her evidence at trial, no problem would
have arisen.  However, she did not adopt, but expressly rejected, a number of
them.  Some of the prior statements, if accepted for the truth of their
contents, might have led the jury to a verdict which was not based on the
evidence.  In particular, Valerie's prior statements, denied at trial, that her
pants were tight and that it was she who gave the respondent a hug outside the
car, if believed, might have been used by the jury to draw the critical
conclusion that Valerie consented.  The majority of the Court of Appeal, while
finding error on this point, suggested that it was less serious than it might
have been since ""the witnesses' prior inconsistent statements were used
mainly to attack their credibility"" (p. 231).  With respect, this
conclusion is no answer to the fact that the jury might well have concluded
from the trial judge's direction that it could use the prior statements as
proving the truth of their contents.  This erroneous direction constitutes a
significant error.

 

XI.              The third error lay in mischaracterizing
the medical evidence.  Dr. Flock testified that Valerie suffered genital
bruising consistent with ""very forceful"" or ""traumatic""
intercourse.  The trial judge suggested to the jury that this evidence might
not be very relevant since Livermore admitted that intercourse had taken
place.  The trial judge said:

 

As
far as the medical evidence of Dr. Flock is concerned, this evidence would
be relevant, particularly relevant, if there was a denial that any sexual
intercourse or attempted sexual intercourse took place but there is no denial
of that. It is admitted.  But, the Crown would ask you to consider this
evidence as an indication of the force which must have been used to have caused
the bruising which the doctor described.  Again, this is a fact which you will
have to consider. [Emphasis added.]

 

I agree with the dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal that this passage might be taken as suggesting that the
evidence of bruising was of little or no relevance, given the admission of
intercourse.  In fact, it may have been relevant as an indication of lack of
consent or resistance.  Since consent was the only issue, this misdirection too
assumes significance.

 

XII.             It remains to consider the
allegation that the trial judge should not have left the defence of honest but
mistaken belief with the jury.  The Court of Appeal was unanimous in concluding
that it should not have, since the defence was unsupported by the evidence.  I
agree with that assessment.

 

XIII.             Livermore testified that he believed
Valerie was consenting to intercourse.  The only question is whether there was
sufficient foundation in the facts to lend an air of reality to the defence of
mistaken but honest belief in consent.  There was evidence that Valerie had
said no; there was no evidence that she had said yes.  The trial judge in
putting this defence to the jury relied on the fact that the girls were out
after midnight, that they willingly entered the car of the accused, that they
changed seats without trying to escape, that the windows of the car were down
and the doors unlocked, that the girls did not scream and the erroneous
conclusion, discussed earlier in these reasons, that there was no evidence of
verbal complaint.  Abella J.A. was of the view that these circumstances did not
provide the required air of reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief
in consent (at p. 226):  

 

                          Not
screaming, drinking beer while under age, being out at 1:00 a.m., parking,
cavalierly trusting a stranger, switching places in a car after a casual
physical encounter, and staying too long in a car someone else has control
over, are neither individually nor collectively any basis at all, let alone
realistic ones, for assuming that someone is agreeing to sexual intercourse. 
In my view, there were no reasonable grounds for the accused's beliefs found in
the package of factors listed by the trial judge.

 

XIV.            Galligan J.A., for the majority,
suggested that ""this case was one of consent or no consent and there was
no air of reality to a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent""
(p. 232).

 

XV.             The common law has long recognized
that defences for which there is no factual basis or evidentiary foundation
should not be put to the jury.  In Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 120, this Court articulated the minimum threshold for mistake of fact
defences, including an accused person's honest but mistaken belief in consent,
as requiring an air of reality to be raised on the evidence and circumstances
to support the defence.  In R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, Cory J. noted
that the air of reality test as it relates to honest but mistaken belief in
consent in all assault offences has been codified by the requirement in s.
265(4)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , that there be
""sufficient evidence"" in order for the judge to put the defence of
mistake to the jury.

 

XVI.            In Pappajohn, McIntyre J.
described the air of reality threshold as follows: ""to convey such a sense
of reality, there must be some evidence which, if believed, would support the
existence of a mistaken but honest belief that the complainant was in fact
consenting to the acts of intercourse which admittedly occurred"" (p.
128).  He observed (at p. 133):

 

To
require the putting of the alternative defence of mistaken belief in consent,
there must be, in my opinion, some evidence beyond the mere assertion of belief
in consent by counsel for the appellant.  This evidence must appear from or be
supported by sources other than the appellant in order to give it any air of
reality.

 

He later clarified this statement in R.
v. Bulmer, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782, at p. 790:

 

These
words appear, on occasion, to have been misunderstood, but I do not withdraw
them.  There will not be an air of reality about a mere statement that ""I
thought she was consenting"" not supported to some degree by other evidence
or circumstances arising in the case....  The question [the trial judge] must
answer is this.  In all the circumstances of this case, is there any reality in
the defence?

 

 

XVII.          McIntyre J. in Pappajohn was
alive to the fact that, absent a requirement that the evidence lend an air of
reality to the defence of mistake of fact, the defence could be put forward by
the accused in every case of sexual assault merely by the accused's assertion
that he believed the complainant consented, to the confusion of the jury and at
the risk of a false verdict.  Evidence lending an air of reality to the defence
may come from the accused or from other sources: Osolin, supra,
at pp. 686-87 per Cory J. and at p. 649 per McLachlin J. 
Nevertheless, the threshold of ""sufficient evidence"" -- the air of
reality test -- must be maintained if we are to ensure that the defence is one
which is not spurious, but founded on the evidence.

 

XVIII.         The defence of mistake of fact in the
context of sexual assault involves two elements: (1) that the accused honestly
believed the complainant consented; and (2) that the accused have been mistaken
in this belief.  In order for the defence to be put to the jury, there must be
evidence lending an air of reality to both of these elements.  Typically, the
second element is established through the assertion by the accused or counsel
for the accused that he believed the complainant consented although her
evidence is to the contrary.  It is in relation to the first element -- honest
belief -- that difficulties arise in establishing an air of reality.  In order
for the belief to be honestly held, the accused cannot have been wilfully blind
about whether consent was given:  Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 570.  Furthermore, since recklessness about whether there was consent
constitutes one aspect of the mens rea of sexual assault (Pappajohn,
supra, at p. 146), the accused cannot have been reckless in his belief
that there was consent.  While the belief need not be reasonable, there must be
something in the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the alleged assault
which lends an air of reality to an honest belief in consent.  

 

XIX.            In the case at bar, the accused
testified that he believed Valerie consented, contrary to her evidence that she
resisted intercourse throughout.  The element of mistake is made out.  There is
no evidence, however, which lends an air of reality to the assertion by the
accused that he had an honest belief in Valerie's consent to intercourse.  The
evidence of Livermore was that Valerie clearly consented.  The evidence of
Valerie was that, far from consenting, she resisted and repeatedly said
""no"".  Tasha's testimony corroborated Valerie's testimony in this
regard.  The question to be answered is whether there was evidence adduced
which would nonetheless lend an air of reality to the creation in the accused's
mind of an honest belief that Valerie was consenting notwithstanding the fact
that their testimony on the central issue of consent was so diametrically
opposed.  In other words, was there a realistic evidentiary basis, upon which
the jury could conclude that what really happened was a third version, that is,
lack of consent but honest mistake by Livermore that it had been given.  In my
view, there was none.

 

XX.             The accused's bare assertion that he
""believed"" that the complainant consented must be supported by
something in the circumstances that suggests that he may honestly have held
such a belief: Pappajohn, supra.  Otherwise, the goal of
screening out the spurious defence based on nothing but the accused's facile
assertion of belief will be thwarted.  Examples of such circumstances are well
documented in the jurisprudence.  For example, sexually aggressive conduct by
the complainant, a previous relationship of intimacy coupled with no reason to
suspect a change of heart, and the case of the known prostitute are frequently
cited as examples of situations in which an honest mistake may be made as to
consent.  Similarly, as noted in R. v. Park, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836,
independent evidence, particularly real evidence, may lend an air of reality to
the defence: at pp. 851-52 per L'Heureux-Dubé J.  If there is no
evidence permitting an inference that the accused honestly believed in consent,
then the accused in assuming consent must be taken to have closed his eyes to
whether there was real consent, i.e., he must have been wilfully blind or
reckless as to whether there was consent.  In such a case, the required air of
reality on the element of the honesty of the accused's belief will be lacking. 

 

XXI.            I agree with Abella J.A. that
evidence of being out late, drinking beer and switching seats in a car is
incapable of providing a foundation for an honest belief in consent to sexual
intercourse.  Such conduct, being equally consistent with non-consent as with
consent, lacks any probative value on the issue.  A man who assumes that
equivocal acts such as these amount to consent to intercourse is assuming
consent not on the basis of the circumstances, but as a result of recklessness
or wilful blindness.  The fact that the girls had an opportunity to leave the
car before there was any indication that the accused had sexual intercourse in
mind does not give rise to an inference of consent.  The fact that Valerie did
not scream although the car windows were open does not lend an air of reality
to the defence: the two men were twice Valerie's age.  The fact that the
accused hugged Valerie when she left the car (whether initiated by her or not),
the fact that he gave Tasha a slip of paper with his name and phone number on
it, the fact that Valerie and Tasha did not flee when finally they returned to
Tasha's apartment, are relevant to Valerie's credibility as a witness. 
However, even if believed, they are insufficient to lend an air of reality to
an honest belief in consent.  

 

XXII.          To put it in the language of Galligan
J.A., for the majority, the case was one of consent or no consent.  There was
nothing in the evidence which supported a third version that Valerie had not
consented but that Livermore honestly believed that she had.  We are therefore
left with his bare assertion of belief.  On the jurisprudence of this Court,
this is insufficient to lend an air of reality to the defence of honest but
mistaken belief.  I conclude that the trial judge erred in putting the defence
of honest but mistaken belief to the jury.  

 

XXIII.         It remains to consider whether a new
trial should be ordered notwithstanding the acquittal at trial.  The test for
setting aside an acquittal and directing a new trial was set out by Sopinka J.
in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374:

 

An
accused who has been acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again
unless it appears that the error at the first trial was such that there is a
reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by
it.

 

XXIV.         In this case, we have no way of knowing
whether the jury acquitted because it had a reasonable doubt about whether
Valerie consented, or whether it acquitted on the basis of a defence which
should not have been left with it.  The cumulative effect of the numerous
errors in this case is such that the Morin test is made out.  Absent the
significant errors at trial, a reasonable jury properly charged may well have
reached a different verdict.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal
and direct a new trial.

 

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

XXV.          La
Forest J. -- I agree with the reasons of Abella J.A., the dissenting judge
in the Court of Appeal ((1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 221), and would on that basis
allow the appeal and order a new trial.  The defence of honest but mistaken
belief did not form part of the dissent, and this appeal being as of right,
that issue is not before us.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

XXVI.         L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- For the reasons of Abella J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal
((1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 221), I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.

 

XXVII.        As regards the defence of honest but
mistaken belief, that issue is not before us since it was unanimously held by
the Court of Appeal that ""this case was one of consent or no consent and
there was no air of reality to a defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent"" (p. 232).  This appeal is an appeal as of right based on the
dissent of Abella J.A. in the Court of Appeal on the sole questions raised in
that dissent, no leave to appeal having been granted on that issue.

 

XXVIII.      In any event, with respect to that defence,
I refer to my reasons for the majority of the Court in R. v. Park,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836.

 

XXIX.         Finally, I cannot but express my strong
disagreement with my colleague Justice Major's positions on both issues
considered, namely the Crown's right of appeal as a matter of law, a point not
discussed before us, and on the facts of this case as well as his analysis of
the alleged errors committed by the trial judge.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

XXX.          Sopinka
J. -- I agree with Justice McLachlin for the reasons that she gives that
a new trial should be ordered by reason of the first three errors found by the
Court of Appeal ((1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 221).  However, I agree with Justice
L'Heureux-Dubé that the issue of honest but mistaken belief is not before us.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Major
J. (dissenting) --

 

I.                 Introduction

 

XXXI.         The appellant is appealing an acquittal
following a trial by judge and jury.  In order to succeed the appellant must
satisfy the court to a reasonable certainty that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same had the jury been properly instructed.  In my
opinion the appellant has failed to do so.

 

II.                Statutory
Provisions

 

XXXII.         Section 686(4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , sets out the Crown's right of appeal from a verdict of
acquittal: 

 

                   686. ...

 

                   (4) 
Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court of appeal may

 

                   (a)
dismiss the appeal; or

 

                   (b)
allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

(i)
order a new trial, or

 

(ii)
except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter
a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a
sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and
direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

 

XXXIII.      This provision is different from the rights
of an accused person appealing a conviction.  Section 686(1)  sets out the
powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals from conviction: 

 

                   686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of
appeal

 

                   (a)
may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i)
the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii)
the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii)
on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                   (b)
may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                    ...

 

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred;

 

XXXIV.      Where an accused appeals from a conviction
at trial, the onus is on him or her to establish that errors were made on the
grounds laid out in s. 686(1) (a)(i), (ii) or (iii).  Once the accused
has discharged this burden, the Court of Appeal must allow the appeal unless
the Crown can satisfy it, pursuant to s. 686(1) (b)(iii), that
notwithstanding those errors there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.

 

XXXV.       However, when the verdict at trial is an
acquittal, the Crown appellant, unlike an accused, does not benefit from the prima
facie assumption that an error warrants a new trial.  The onus is on the
Crown from the outset to establish that the errors complained of materially
affected the verdict, such that a new trial is justified. 

 

III.               Historical
Overview

 

XXXVI.      At common law, there was no appeal from a
verdict of acquittal.  It remains the case in England that the Crown has no
right of appeal from an acquittal, although the Attorney General has the right
to refer any point of law that arose in the case to the Court of Appeal for
their opinion: Criminal Justice Act 1972 (U.K.), 1972, c. 71, s.
36.  The reference does not affect the acquittal.

 

XXXVII.     It was not until 1923 that the Criminal
Code  of Canada provided for appeals in criminal cases:  S.C. 1923, c. 41,
s. 9.  At that time, only convictions could be appealed.  Section 1014(3) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, provided that the Court of
Appeal could allow the appeal and either quash the conviction and enter a
verdict of acquittal, or order a new trial.  Section 1014(2)  of the Criminal
Code  provided that the court could dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding any
errors at trial, if no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred. 

 

XXXVIII.    It was not until 1930 that the Attorney
General was provided with a right of appeal from acquittal by virtue of s.
1013(4) and (5) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, amended S.C.
1930, c. 11, s. 28, which provided:

 

                   1013. ...

 

                   (4)
Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the Attorney General shall have
the right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone.

 

                   (5)
The procedure upon such an appeal and the powers of the court of appeal,
including the power to grant a new trial, shall mutatis mutandis and so
far as the same are applicable to appeals upon a question of law alone, be
similar to the procedure prescribed and the powers given by sections one
thousand and twelve to one thousand and twenty-one of this Act, inclusive, and
the Rules of Court passed pursuant thereto, and to section five hundred and
seventy-six of this Act.

 

XXXIX.      The Attorney General was thereby granted
the same rights of appeal as an accused.  Appellate courts, however, held that
the Crown was not entitled to the prima facie assumption that an error
at trial warranted allowing the appeal unless there had been no miscarriage of
justice:  R. v. Curlett (1936), 66 C.C.C. 256 (Alta. C.A.), R. v.
Bourgeois (1937), 69 C.C.C. 120 (Sask. C.A.).  

 

XL.             In White v. The King, [1947]
S.C.R. 268, and Cullen v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 658, the Supreme Court
of Canada concluded that the Crown could invoke the curative provision of s.
1014(2)  in the same way as an accused appealing a conviction.  In White
the Court stated the test for an appeal by the Crown, at p. 276:

 

...the
proper rule to be followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus was on the
Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the
same if the magistrate had properly directed himself. 

 

XLI.            The 1954 revision of the Criminal
Code set out the current provisions regarding appeals from acquittal by the
Attorney General.  The explicit reference that the Crown would have the same
rights as the accused on an appeal, mutatis mutandis, was removed.  In
subsequent cases appellate courts generally maintained that it was the Crown's
onus to establish that, not only had error or misdirection occurred, but the
verdict was affected:  R. v. Savoie (1956), 117 C.C.C. 327 (N.B.C.A.); R.
v. Forgeron (1958), 121 C.C.C. 310 (N.S.S.C.); R. v. Paquette
(1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 154 (Ont. C.A.).

 

XLII.           The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed
this view in Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  Martland J. held
that the sections of the Code dealing with appeals by the Crown did not
contain any provision equivalent to s. 613(1)(b)(iii) (now s. 686(1) (b)(iii)). 
Martland J. observed that the provisions of the Criminal Code  had
changed since White and Cullen, but concluded that the onus on
the Crown remained the same (at p. 292):

 

In
the present case, therefore, it was the duty of the Crown, in order to obtain a
new trial, to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have
been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury. 

 

XLIII.          In more recent years, this Court has
emphasized that the onus on the Crown is a heavy one. In R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, Sopinka J. stated (at p. 374):

 

                   The
onus resting on the Crown when it appeals an acquittal was settled in Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277. It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy
the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury
had been properly instructed. 

 

                   I
am prepared to accept that the onus is a heavy one and that the Crown must
satisfy the court with a reasonable degree of certainty. An accused who has been acquitted
once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears that the error
at the first trial was such that there is a reasonable degree of certainty that
the outcome may well have been affected by it. Any more stringent test would
require an appellate court to predict with certainty what happened in the jury
room.  That it cannot do.  [Emphasis added.] 

 

XLIV.         In R. v. Evans, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
629, the Court reiterated that the onus on the Crown is a heavy one, and the
Crown must satisfy the court ""with a reasonable degree of certainty""
(p. 645) that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the
error not occurred.  Cory J. noted Canada's generally liberal approach to Crown
appeals in contrast to other jurisdictions (at pp. 645-46):

 

                   In
setting the standard for reversal, it is worth observing that, among the major
English-speaking common-law jurisdictions, Canada appears to possess the most
liberal provisions for Crown appeals. In some jurisdictions, particularly in
the United States, the prosecution is limited to interlocutory appeals from
unfavourable rulings made before a verdict is reached. Other jurisdictions
permit prosecution appeals in limited circumstances such as where the
information is quashed; where the trial is held to be a nullity or where a
directed verdict of acquittal is entered....

 

                   Among
appellate courts there has always been a great deal of healthy respect for and
deference to a jury verdict of acquittal. This deferential approach is
appropriate and correct. The special significance of a verdict of acquittal by
a jury has also been recognized by this Court in R. v. Kirkness, [1990]
3 S.C.R. 74. There on behalf of the majority it was said at p. 83:

 

The
verdict of the jury constitutes, in a very real way, the verdict of the
community. Trial by jury in criminal cases is a process that functions
exceedingly well and constitutes a fundamentally important aspect of our
democratic society. It is not members of the judiciary, but rather the members
of the jury, sitting as members of the community, who make the decision as to guilt
or innocence which is so vitally important both to the individual accused and
the community.

 

                                                                    ...

 

It
follows that only if there was a significant error made by the trial
judge in the course of the charge should the jury's verdict of acquittal be set
aside.  [Emphasis added by Cory J.]

 

XLV.           The onus on the Crown to overturn an
acquittal as stated is a heavy or substantial one.  The Crown must demonstrate,
with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict would not necessarily
have been the same had the jury been properly instructed.  Unlike an accused
person appealing a conviction, the Crown does not benefit from the prima
facie assumption that any error warrants a new trial.

 

IV.              Analysis

 

XLVI.         It has been common ground throughout
this appeal that there were errors in the trial judge's charge to the jury. 
The appellant described the following:

 

1.                Incorrectly
summarizing the evidence of the complainant Valerie regarding her statements to
the accused.

 

2. 
Failing to properly address the jury's request to rehear the above-mentioned
evidence.

 

3.                Improperly
characterizing medical evidence as lacking relevance.

 

4.                Failing
to instruct the jury on the limited use of prior inconsistent statements at
trial.

 

5.                
Putting the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to the  jury.

 

It is necessary to consider each of
these.

 

A.                Incorrect Summary
of Evidence

 

XLVII.        The trial judge incorrectly stated that
Valerie's evidence was that she did not come out and say ""no""
exactly.  However, this error did not have the effect of changing the outcome
of the trial.  Immediately after stating that he did not believe the
complainant to have testified that she said ""no"", the trial judge
admitted that he might be mistaken about that.  The trial judge told the jury
that it was their recollection of the evidence, and not his, which was
important.  The trial judge quoted counsel for the Crown as using the phrase
""no means no"" during her address to the jury.  

 

XLVIII.       In addition, the question of the jury
regarding the evidence indicates that the jury understood the complainant's
evidence to be that she said no.  The question was:

 

                   The jury would like
to hear evidence repeated with respect to the   witness Valerie...answering to
both the Crown and the defence   questioning about when Valerie said, no, to Carson
Livermore.            Further, can we also hear Valerie's comments of, no,
during the                                                    preliminary
hearing?

 

It appears that the jury understood
Valerie to have said ""no"" notwithstanding the incorrect summary by
the trial judge, and wanted to hear the evidence again.  They were not misled
by the judge's error in the inaccurate summary of the evidence on that point.

 

B.                Failure to Replay
Evidence for the Jury

 

XLIX.         The appellant has argued that the trial
judge erred in denying the jury's request to have the complainant's evidence
replayed, and that this error, combined with the trial judge's mistake in
summarizing the same evidence, would have made another outcome reasonably
certain.  The appellant submits that the trial judge did not give the jury a
""full, careful and correct response"" as required by R. v. Naglik,
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p. 139, although that case is of doubtful value to this
appeal, as there the problem was confusion over the trial judge's
instructions.  In this case we are dealing with a request to rehear the
complainant's evidence.  

 

L.                Any request for instruction or
assistance from a jury must be treated carefully.  However, in the case where a
jury wishes to have evidence read or played again, problems can arise,
especially in procedural fairness.  In R. v. Wydryk (1971), 5 C.C.C.
(2d) 473, it was noted that ""when some particular area of a witness'
evidence is read at a jury's request, it is incumbent upon the trial Judge to
see that all the evidence pertaining to that area is included--else an unfair
and biased result might appear"" (p. 480).  This was the problem faced by
the trial judge.  

 

LI.               R. v. Ostrowski, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 82, is notable on this point.  In that case a jury requested
transcripts, particularly those of seven witnesses.  The trial judge asked the
jury to attempt to use their collective recollection to solve the problem and
to return if they needed further assistance.  The jury did not make such a
request, but returned with a verdict.  Cory J. held that no error had been
committed by the trial judge, as he had not closed the door on the request (at
p. 83).  Similarly, the door was not closed in the instant case.  The jury was
not advised that they could not obtain assistance, but that they should make a
further attempt on their own and that if this attempt failed, assistance would
be forthcoming.

 

LII.              I am not convinced that the trial
judge erred in his handling of the request.  He advised the jury of several
problems involving their request, including practical problems with finding the
evidence in question, and fairness concerns which would have necessitated
replaying the respondent's evidence as well.  He then asked the jury to attempt
to use their collective recollection of the evidence to either satisfy
themselves of the answer or at least narrow the question.  He told the jury
that if they were unsuccessful in this the court would do its best to
accommodate them.  In my opinion he did not discourage the jury from returning
with a new request; rather, he indicated a willingness to accommodate the jury
if they would first make a further attempt to solve the problem without
replaying the evidence.  The jury seems to have been satisfied and returned
with a verdict within 40 minutes.

 

C.                Incorrect
Characterization of Medical Evidence

 

LIII.            The third error alleged by the
appellant is that the trial judge improperly characterized the medical evidence
in the case.  The trial judge stated that the medical evidence would be
particularly relevant if the accused had denied that intercourse took place,
which he had not.  The appellant submits that this implied that the evidence
had no other particular relevance, when in fact it had relevance on the issue
of consent.  This would have been true had the trial judge said nothing else. 
However, the trial judge also said,

 

But,
the Crown would ask you to consider this evidence as an indication of the force
which must have been used to have caused the bruising which the doctor
described.  Again, this is a fact which you will have to consider.
[Emphasis added.]

 

I agree with Galligan J.A. that the
judge did not remove the evidence from the jury's consideration on the issue of
consent.

 

D.                 Failure to
Instruct the Jury on Prior Inconsistent Statements

 

LIV.            The failure of the trial judge to
inform the jury that prior inconsistent statements which had not been adopted
by the witnesses could be used only for assessing credibility was an error. 
However, in the context of this case the error was not serious.  The following
inconsistent statements were put to the complainant Valerie:

 

(a)               that
she gave the respondent a hug

 

(b)               that
the respondent and the co-accused Miller forced her to drink

 

(c)               that
Miller told the respondent to get off her

 

(d)               that
her pants were tight.

 

The following prior inconsistencies
were put to Tasha:

 

(a)               an
absence of prior reference to Valerie's hands being pinned

 

(b)               her
statement that she hit the respondent's shoulder while he was 

assaulting
the complainant

 

(c)               an
absence of reference to nudging Miller with her elbow

 

(d)               that
she did nothing while Miller touched her breast

 

(e)               that
she never told Miller to stop

 

(f)                that
Miller might only have been holding the car door open when they changed seats

 

(g)               her
description of where Miller put his hands

 

(h)               that
she had agreed to meet the two men the next night.

 

LV.             It is clear from the questions asked
by counsel for the respondent and the charge to the jury that the prior
inconsistent statements were in fact used mainly to attack the credibility of
the witnesses in question.  The trial judge said:

 

Essentially
the position of Mr. Levine on behalf of Mr. Livermore is that the evidence of
Valerie...ought not to be accepted because of the material inconsistencies.

 

LVI.            It is apparent that when the trial
judge refers to the prior statements of Tasha and Valerie as constituting
""if nothing else the foundation for an honest but mistaken belief in
consent"" he is referring to the position taken by Mr. Galluzzo, counsel
for the co-accused, Miller, who was acquitted.  This is not an instruction but
a statement of the defence position of the co-accused.  In fact, the prior
inconsistent statements mainly refer to charges against Miller and would have
had little bearing on the findings of fact by the jury regarding the
respondent.

 

LVII.           In addition, the inconsistent
statements did not deal with the main issue of this trial, which was consent. 
If the jury had used the statements for the truth of their contents, the
evidence regarding consent would have remained relatively untouched.  The
appellant submitted that Valerie's statement about giving the respondent a hug
and Tasha's statement about getting the respondent's phone number are both
related to the issue of consent.  In my opinion the relationship of these two
statements to the issue of consent is tenuous.

 

LVIII.          While failure to instruct a jury on the
limited use of prior inconsistent statements is an error, and one which is
sometimes fatal, in this case the inconsistent statements were before the jury
to test credibility and not for any other purpose, such as the truth of their
contents.

 

E.Placement
of the Defence of Honest but Mistaken Belief Before the Jury

 

LIX.            The final error alleged by the appellant
is that the trial judge put the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
consent to the jury.  I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the
factors listed by the trial judge as supporting the respondent's assertion of
honest belief in consent do not provide an ""air of reality"" as
required for the defence by  R. v. Park, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836.  Placement
of a defence which is unavailable to an accused before a jury can be a serious
error, as the jury may decide the case based on the incorrect defence.

 

LX.             Notwithstanding the potential for
serious error when an incorrect defence is placed before the jury, I agree with
the characterization of the case by Galligan J.A. in the Court of Appeal as one
of consent or no consent and that credibility was the key issue.  The questions
from the defence to the complainant, the accused, and witnesses clearly point
to a defence of consent.  In my opinion it is highly unlikely that the jury
would have decided this case based on honest but mistaken belief in consent. 
Because of this, had the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent not
been before the jury the verdict would likely have been the same.  

 

V.                Conclusion

 

LXI.            The circumstances giving rise to the
complaint were decisive in this case.  The alleged sexual assault took place in
the bucket seat of a sports car.  The cramped quarters were such that on the
facts of this case some co-operation, if not the consent, of the complainant
was necessary for the alleged offence to have occurred.  This was consistent
with the accused's testimony and inconsistent with that of the complainant. 
The jury was aware of the circumstances of the alleged offence and concluded
that the accused proceeded with consent, or at least they had a reasonable
doubt about his guilt.  This finding of fact represents the collective wisdom
of the community as expressed by the jury and should not be interfered with. 
The errors of the trial judge such as they were would not have changed the
result.

 

LXII.           The important differences in the
status of an accused person and the Crown have been given constitutional
strength by the guarantees of individual rights set out in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  In addition to the heavier onus on the
Crown to successfully appeal from an acquittal the Crown can only appeal on a
question of law (s. 676(1) (a)) while the accused may appeal on both
questions of law alone and, with leave of the court, on questions of fact or of
mixed law and fact (s. 675(1) (a)).  In addition an accused may appeal to
this Court as of right when an acquittal has been overturned by a Court of
Appeal (s. 691(2)(a)).

 

LXIII.          Applying these principles to the facts
of this case, I am not persuaded that the Crown has met the heavier onus
required by law.  The question of consent or its lack was pivotal in this
case.  The errors of the trial judge as identified were, for the reasons
previously stated, not serious enough in these circumstances that the jury, had
the errors not been made, is likely to have reached a different result.

 

LXIV.         The appellant has not demonstrated to a
reasonable certainty that the jury would have not necessarily had a reasonable
doubt about the guilt of the accused.  For the reasons stated it is my opinion
that not only is it uncertain that a different result would have occurred but
for the errors, but that it is unlikely that this would have occurred.

 

LXV.           In the result, I would dismiss the
appeal and confirm the order of the Court of Appeal in upholding the acquittal
of the respondent.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
quebec

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Evidence ‑‑ Crown's obligation to make disclosure to defence ‑‑
Crown ordered on appeal to disclose information as to the evidence to be given
by police informer, to give his name and whereabouts and to provide opportunity
to examine him ‑‑ Disclosure to be made before second trial ‑‑
Examination aborted owing to doubts as to identity of hooded witness ‑‑
Other information not disclosed ‑‑ Stay granted at opening of new
trial because of lack of disclosure and undue delay ‑‑ Stay quashed
on appeal and new trial ordered ‑‑ Disclosure principles to be
applied.

 

                   Appellants at trial
tried unsuccessfully to subpoena Billy Joe, a police informer (but not a police
officer), who was key to the defence theory but the trial judge ruled that his
name was privileged.  The Court of Appeal ordered that a new trial be held and
that the Crown disclose the evidence of the informer before the trial, give
his  full name and whereabouts and provide an opportunity to examine him before
the new trial.  Appellants' counsel sought to interview Billy Joe before the
second trial and were informed by the Crown that the questioning would be
limited to specific matters described in the Court of Appeal's decision, that
the interview could not be taped and that a court reporter could not be
present.  Appellants aborted the interview because they doubted the identity of
the hooded man protected by private bodyguards who was presented at the
interview.  The Crown did not provide the defence with the name, address or any
identifying features of Billy Joe and made no disclosure of Billy Joe's
proposed testimony but the Crown did provide a copy of Billy Joe's criminal
record which had been censored in order to disguise his identity.  At the
opening of the second trial, and before the jury was chosen, the appellants
successfully applied for a judicial stay of proceedings, pursuant to
s. 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , on the
grounds that the Crown had failed to disclose essential and relevant evidence
and that the Crown had violated the appellants' rights to be tried within a
reasonable time.  The Crown appealed and the stay was quashed and a new trial
ordered on the original charges.  The trial judge at that new trial was to rule
on the extent and timing of disclosure in relation to Billy Joe's evidence. 
This appeal arose as of right on a question of law alone as the Court of Appeal
decision had reversed an acquittal (the stay).  At issue is the proper
application of the principles set out in R. v. Stinchcombe involving
disclosure of the identity of the Crown informant.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux-Dubé J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Sopinka, La Forest, Gonthier,
Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: The appeal based on non‑compliance
with the Court of Appeal (No. 1) disclosure order should be allowed.  The
ground based on unreasonable delay, however, failed for the reasons given by
Baudouin J.A. in the second appeal.

 

                   The issue of
privilege, since it was decided by the Court of Appeal (No. 1), was not open to
the Court of Appeal (No. 2) and was not open to the Crown in this appeal.  Where
new evidence which may warrant a change in the terms of the Crown's obligation
to disclose comes into the possession of the Crown, the appropriate procedure
is an application to the trial judge to vary.  The trial judge has a discretion
to vary an order for disclosure on the basis of evidence which establishes that
the factual foundation upon which the order was based has changed.  Such an
application should be made at the earliest opportunity.  Difficulties in
compliance with disclosure orders should be resolved by application to vary
disclosure obligations rather than by non‑compliance followed by an
attempt at ex post facto justification on the basis of alleged new
circumstances.

 

                   No appeal was taken
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal (No. 1) and no proceedings were
brought before the trial judge to vary it.  Accordingly, it was binding in
accordance with its terms and could not be collaterally attacked.  No
application was made in this Court to adduce fresh evidence respecting the
possible jeopardy to Billy Joe's safety and no application was made to second
trial judge to vary the terms of disclosure based on this evidence.

 

                   The judgment in
Court of Appeal (No. 1) was sufficiently precise to describe the extent and
timing of the disclosure obligation of the Crown in relation to Billy Joe. 
Although only Billy Joe's evidence was explicitly required to be disclosed
""before trial"", it was implicit from other portions of the judgment
that the timing as to disclosure of the other two requirements was also to be
""before trial"".  Identity and whereabouts are material to the ability
of the defence to make full answer and defence and therefore had to be
disclosed prior to trial.  Although the Crown had some discretion as to exactly
when disclosure would be made prior to trial, such disclosure had to be within
sufficient time to enable the appellants to make full answer and defence.

 

                   The Crown's
discretion with respect to the timing of disclosure existed before judicial
review of the exercise of that discretion.  It did not continue after its
exercise was reviewed by the Court of Appeal (No. 1) and a ruling was
made.  Otherwise, this would permit the Crown to disregard a judicial
determination that disclosure has to be made and that information is not subject
to informer privilege.

 

                   The Crown totally
failed to make full disclosure prior to trial in relation to Billy Joe as
required by Court of Appeal (No. 1)'s decision.  The Crown did not provide
(1) will‑say or statements of the informer prior to trial, (2) Billy
Joe's full, real name, and his whereabouts, or (3) suitable conditions to
interview him.  The circumstances of the interview, however, were dictated by
the informant Billy Joe and not by the Crown.  Where there is intervening non‑disclosure
by the informant, the lack of cooperation could not be attributed vicariously
to the Crown.  The conditions under which the Crown made the informant
available (hooded and with two bodyguards and with no chance to record the
interview), however, were so constrained as to amount to less than full
disclosure.  Defence counsel could not be faulted for not conducting an
interview of the person presented when his identity was legitimately in doubt.

 

                   Failure to comply
with the obligation to disclose by the Crown could impair the right of the
accused to make full answer and defence in breach of s. 7  of the Charter . 
The terms of disclosure accord with the decision in Stinchcombe except
that in ordering that the informant be made available the judgment is an
extension of obligation resting on the Crown.  The obligation of the Crown does
not extend to producing its witnesses for oral discovery.  Crown witnesses,
even informants, are not the property of the Crown whom the Crown can control
and produce for examination by the defence.  Nevertheless, subject to variation
by appropriate proceedings, the Court of Appeal (No. 1)'s judgment was binding
on the Crown.  The matter could not be remitted to the trial judge to determine
de novo the terms, content, and conditions of disclosure relating to
Billy Joe.

 

                   It would not be
appropriate to stay the proceedings without affording the Crown an opportunity
to either comply with the terms of the judgment of the Court of Appeal
(No. 1) or move to vary it on the basis of information that has come into
its possession since the date of the judgment.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  The disclosure ""order"" could not be implied from the
terms of the judgment.  The relevant portions of the judgment merely
characterized the error made at trial in order to provide guidance to the trial
judge for the new trial ordered.  Absent a specific order by the court, such
guidelines have never been regarded as binding on either the trial judge or the
parties.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
(No. 1) remitted the whole issue to the trial judge to be dealt with at
the new trial in a manner consistent with its decision.  Given the appellants'
contention, and perhaps the Crown's perception, that the Court of Appeal (No.
1) had made an ""order"" that the Crown had to obey, steps were taken
by the Crown to comply with the demands of the defence inasmuch as the
circumstances required to ensure the protection and security of the informer. 
As the Court of Appeal (No. 2) held, however, the judgment of the Court of
Appeal (No. 1) was not binding on either the trial judge or the parties as
regards the content of disclosure and, as a consequence, it will be for the
trial judge to reconsider this issue.  Consequently, this issue was to be
reconsidered by the trial judge in light of all relevant circumstances.

 

                   The matter of
disclosure could have been dealt with in two ways at the second trial: 
either the Crown could have made an application to the trial judge to set
conditions for further disclosure of information concerning the informer had
such disclosure been found necessary, or the defence, if not satisfied by the
extent of the disclosure, could have applied to the trial judge to order the
Crown to disclose even further information regarding the same.  In both cases,
the need to protect the identity of the police informer and other circumstances
related to the disclosure order would have been dealt with.

 

                   Had the judgment of
the Court of Appeal (No. 1) been construed as an ""order"" to
produce the police informer, it would have gone much beyond Stinchcombe. 
The Crown can only be ordered to produce what it has and it does not
""have"" people; the majority was agreed with in this respect.

 

                   The majority was
also agreed with that no unreasonable delay occurred in the circumstances of
this case.

 

                   A stay of
proceedings should not have been granted but the Court of Appeal (No. 2)'s
order of a new trial should be upheld and the question of the extent of
disclosure should be directed to the trial judge.

and Iacobucci JJ. -- This appeal concerns the application of the
principles relating to Crown disclosure as set forth by this Court in R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, in the peculiar circumstances of this
case involving disclosure of the identity of a Crown informant.

 

I.  Facts

 

2                 The appellants, Khela and
Dhillon, were charged in relation to a conspiracy in late May 1986 to commit
murder of persons aboard an aircraft in the United States by placing a bomb on
the plane.  They were arrested and placed in custody on May 30, 1986, and have
been in continuous custody since then.  They pleaded not guilty and waived
their right to a preliminary inquiry.

 

3                 At their first trial, on
December 23, 1986, the appellants were found guilty of all three counts of
conspiracy by a jury but a conviction was only registered with respect to the
first count.  The appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment.  During the
trial, the appellants had twice tried unsuccessfully to subpoena a police
informer, ""Billy Joe"" (who was not a police officer), to have his
testimony heard.  The trial judge refused, however, holding that the name of
the informer was privileged.  Billy Joe was a crucial contact person during the
investigation of the appellants by the undercover police officers.  The defence
was that discussions had taken place between the appellant, Khela, and Billy
Joe, and $8000 had been paid to Billy Joe to buy a stolen car, as part of a
conspiracy between Billy Joe and Khela to import stolen vehicles into the
United States.  A total amount of $20,000 would be paid, and $8000 of this
amount had already been paid to Billy Joe.  The Crown's theory was that the
money had been paid to have an airplane blown up.

 

4                 The appellants' appeal (notice
of appeal filed January 20, 1987) was allowed by the Court of Appeal
(No. 1) ((1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 81) on September 9, 1991, and a new trial
was ordered.  Proulx J.A., writing for the court, held that the identity of the
police informer was not privileged, should have been disclosed, and ordered a
new trial.  Proulx J.A. concluded as follows, at p. 93:

 

                   For
these reasons, I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in not ordering
at the request of the appellants that the Crown disclose, (1) the evidence
of the informer before the trial; (2) the full name and whereabouts of
Billy Joe, and (3) that the Crown makes Billy Joe available to the
appellants.  [Emphasis added.]

 

5                 Before the second trial, in
February 1992, appellants' counsel sought to interview Billy Joe.  They were
informed by the Crown that he would be made available, but that questioning
would be limited to the specific matters described in the Court of Appeal's
decision (regarding payment of $8000, and meetings with the ""explosives
expert"" and Khela), and that the interview could neither be taped nor
could a court reporter be present.  At the interview on February 27, 1992, at
the Crown offices of the Montreal court house, they met a recalcitrant
""Billy Joe"" wearing a hood over his head and flanked by two large men
(apparently bodyguards) who were identified only as not being police officers
by the Crown who was present at the interview.  ""Billy Joe"" refused
to respond to questions in English, only speaking French, although at the first
trial, evidence had established that Billy Joe was fluent in English.  Defence
counsel doubted Billy Joe's identity and the interview was aborted without any
questions having been asked.  The Crown also provided a copy of Billy Joe's
criminal record with deletions of dates and places to disguise his identity. 
The Crown did not provide the defence with the name, address, or any other
identifying features of Billy Joe, nor did the Crown provide disclosure of
Billy Joe's proposed testimony.

 

6                 At the opening of the second
trial on March 10, 1992 ([1992] Q.J. No. 409) and before the jury was chosen,
the appellants made two applications for a judicial stay of proceedings
pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
on the grounds that:

 

(1)The
Crown failed to disclose to the defence essential and relevant evidence as
required by the judgment of the Court of Appeal; and

 

(2)The
Crown violated the rights of the accused to be tried within a reasonable time .
. . .

 

The evidence in support of these
applications included two affidavits sworn by Dhillon's counsel, which included
as exhibits a series of letters written by Crown and defence counsel regarding
the history of the matter, and the nature and extent of disclosure made with
respect to Billy Joe.  The Crown submitted that it was not obliged to make
disclosure of the name and whereabouts of Billy Joe or make him available
because the judgment of the Court of Appeal did not contain a specific order.

 

7                 Steinberg J. of the Superior
Court held that the appellants' ss. 7  and 11 (b) Charter  rights
had been infringed.  He accordingly entered a stay of proceedings pursuant to
s. 24(1)  of the Charter , and ordered the release of the
appellants.  The Quebec Court of Appeal ((1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 81) allowed the
Crown's subsequent appeal, quashed the stay of proceedings, and ordered a new
trial on the original charges, at which new trial the trial judge would have to
rule on the extent and timing of disclosure in relation to Billy Joe's
evidence.  This appeal thus reaches this Court as an appeal as of right,
falling under s. 691(2) (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , as an appeal on a question of law alone from a court of appeal
decision reversing an acquittal (a stay being tantamount to an acquittal):  R.
v. Kalanj, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1594.

 

II.  Analysis

 

8                 The order for a stay was supported
on two grounds:  unreasonable delay and Crown non-disclosure.  With respect to
the first ground we agree with Baudouin J.A. in the Court of Appeal that this
ground fails.

 

9                 The second ground relates to
non-compliance with the decision of Proulx J.A. who wrote on behalf of the
court.  That decision preceded this Court's judgment in Stinchcombe, supra,
but, subject to the reservation which we express later in these reasons with
respect to the third requirement, the decision accords with principles
expressed in Stinchcombe.  No appeal was taken or sought to be taken
from that judgment of the Court of Appeal nor were any proceedings brought
before the trial judge to vary it. Accordingly, it was binding in accordance
with its terms and cannot now be collaterally attacked.  

 

10               In the Court of Appeal
(No. 2) and in this Court, the Crown sought to reopen the issue of
privilege relating to the identity of Billy Joe.  Baudouin J.A. in his judgment
apparently regarded all issues relating to disclosure, including the
application of the judgment of Proulx J.A., as being open.  The issue of
privilege having been decided by the Court of Appeal (No. 1) was not open to
the Court of Appeal (No. 2) and is not open to the Crown in this appeal.  The
Crown alluded to evidence that has come into its possession tending to show
that the safety of Billy Joe is in jeopardy.  It is not clear as to when this
information came into the Crown's possession.  The Crown referred to this
information but no application was  made in this Court to adduce fresh evidence
and no application was made to Steinberg J. to vary the terms of
disclosure based on this evidence.  This is insufficient to warrant reopening
the issue of privilege in this Court.  Where new evidence which may warrant a
change in the terms of the Crown's obligation to disclose comes into the
possession of the Crown, the appropriate procedure is an application to the
trial judge to vary.  The trial judge has a discretion to vary an order for
disclosure on the basis of evidence which establishes that the factual
foundation upon which the order was based has changed.  Such an application
should be made at the earliest opportunity.  Difficulties in compliance with
disclosure orders should be resolved by application to vary disclosure
obligations rather than by non-compliance followed by an attempt at ex post
facto justification on the basis of alleged new circumstances. 

 

11               The Court of Appeal (No. 2) also
held that the record before Steinberg J. on the application prior to the
second trial was clearly insufficient to determine whether the Crown had
respected its disclosure obligations.  Baudouin J.A. appears to have based this
primarily on the confusion between Crown and defence counsel and held that the
debate had never been resolved based on a full knowledge of the facts.

 

12               Resolution of this preliminary
question as to the sufficiency of the record before Steinberg J. involves two
questions:

 

(a)whether
Proulx J.A.'s judgment in the Court of Appeal was sufficiently precise to
describe the extent and timing of the disclosure obligation of the Crown
in relation to Billy Joe; and

 

(b)whether
the facts as to the extent of actual Crown disclosure in relation to
Billy Joe were established at the pre-trial applications before Steinberg J.

 

13               Turning to the first question,
Proulx J.A.'s judgment in the Court of Appeal (No. 1) held, at p. 92, that
Billy Joe was ""at the core of the theory of the defence"".  He was
witness to material facts and an agent provocateur.  Thus, he fell
within recognized exceptions to privilege, mandating disclosure of his identity
and of his communications.  Proulx J.A., at p. 92, identified five issues
central to the defence for which Billy Joe's potential evidence was relevant: 
""(1) the nature of the agreement; (2) the lack of agreement; (3) the lack
of intent; (4) the issue of entrapment . . ., and (5) . . . credibility"". 
Proulx J.A. concluded very clearly at p. 93 that there were three
elements to the Crown disclosure relating to the informant, Billy Joe:

 

                   For
these reasons, I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in not ordering
at the request of the appellants that the Crown disclose, (1) the evidence
of the informer before the trial; (2) the full name and whereabouts of
Billy Joe, and (3) that the Crown makes Billy Joe available to the
appellants.  [Emphasis added.]

 

As Steinberg J. noted on the
application at the second trial:

 

. .
. the opinion of Proulx, J., speaking on behalf of a unanimous Court of Appeal,
is clear and unequivocal on this issue.  The Crown had the obligation to
provide the Defense, prior to the commencement of the trial, with the name and
whereabouts of ""Billy Joe"", so that he could be summoned as a witness
and to make him available.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Accordingly, the extent of disclosure
was made clear by Proulx J.A.'s reasons.  The timing as to this
disclosure is also made sufficiently clear.  It is true that the first
requirement of disclosure in Proulx's judgment refers to Billy Joe's evidence
being disclosed ""before trial"", but the timing as to disclosure of
the other two requirements is not stated.  Yet, that the other two elements had
to be done ""before trial"" is implicit from the other portions of
Proulx J.A.'s reasons.  Identity and whereabouts being material to the ability
of the defence to make full answer and defence, they had to be disclosed prior
to trial.  Indeed, the Crown's attempt to make Billy Joe available at the
aborted interview supports this view of the timing of disclosure in Proulx
J.A.'s decision.  This did, obviously, leave the Crown with some discretion as
to the exact point disclosure was made prior to trial, but such disclosure had
to be within sufficient time to enable the appellants to make full answer and
defence.

 

14               The Crown's discretion with
respect to the timing of disclosure, however, exists before judicial
review of the exercise of that discretion.  Crown discretion did not continue
after its exercise was reviewed by the Court of Appeal (No. 1) and a
ruling was made.  Otherwise, this would permit the Crown to disregard a
judicial determination that disclosure has to be made and that information is
not subject to informer privilege.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal
(No. 2), with respect, erred in finding that the Crown's discretion as to
timing and extent of disclosure continued to exist.

 

15               With respect to the second aspect
of the alleged inadequacy of the factual record before Steinberg J., in our
opinion it was sufficient to determine whether the Crown had met its disclosure
obligations.  That factual record consisted of counsel submissions on the
extent of actual disclosure, and an affidavit by one of the defence counsel,
Louis Pasquin (counsel for Dhillon), containing exhibits of disclosure
correspondence between Crown and defence counsel.  The Crown itself admitted in
this Court that much of the evidence before Steinberg J. was adduced by
consent, without reference to the strict rules of evidence.  During the Crown's
argument on the application, Steinberg J. noted the reliability of the evidence
as follows and implied that credibility was not in issue:

 

. .
. I have three attorneys, three reputable attorneys who have informed me of
what happened at this meeting.  They substantially agree on what happened,
there's no point in asking them what didn't happen.  [Emphasis added.]

 

16               The record for each of the
elements of Proulx J.A.'s disclosure order was as follows:

 

(a)It
was uncontested that since the first Quebec Court of Appeal judgment, the Crown
had not disclosed any additional information about the evidence of Billy Joe.

 

(b)It
was undisputed that the Crown had never divulged this information nor was it
willing to do so.

 

(c)It
was uncontested that the only access that appellant's counsel had to Billy Joe
was the opportunity to ask circumscribed questions without the benefit of a
court reporter or recording device while Billy Joe was masked and surrounded by
two non-police bodyguards.

 

In our view, the record established
adequate facts to determine whether there had been disclosure in accordance
with the judgment of the Court of Appeal (No. 1).

 

17               Based on the above-noted record,
it is quite clear that the Crown totally failed to make full disclosure prior
to trial in relation to Billy Joe as required by the three elements of
Proulx J.A.'s decision.  For the first element, the Crown provided no
will-say or statements of the informer prior to trial.  For the second element,
the Crown did not provide Billy Joe's full, real name, and his whereabouts. 
The final element of Proulx J.A.'s order is the most problematic.  This is
because the circumstances of the interview may not have been so much dictated by
the Crown, but rather by the informant, Billy Joe, himself.  For this aspect of
the disclosure, where there is intervening non-disclosure by the informant, it
is difficult to attribute the lack of cooperation vicariously to the Crown. 
The conditions for the interview were apparently dictated by the informant
himself.  It is true that the conditions under which the Crown made the
informant available to the defence were so constrained as to amount to less
than full disclosure, i.e., hooded and with two bodyguards, and with no chance
to record the interview.  Defence counsel, owing to the hood, could not confirm
that the individual presented as ""Billy Joe"" was truly the informer. 
Defence counsel cannot be faulted for not having conducted an interview of the
hooded ""Billy Joe"" when they had legitimate concerns as to his true
identity.

 

18               Failure to comply with the
obligation to disclose by the Crown could impair the right of the accused to
make full answer and defence in breach of s. 7  of the Charter . 
Steinberg J. directed a stay but relied, at least in part, on the ground
of unreasonable delay which we find was in error.  On the other hand, we find
that the Crown is in breach of its obligation to disclose as determined by
Proulx J.A.  The terms of disclosure accord with the decision in Stinchcombe,
supra, except that, in ordering that the informant be made available,
the judgment is an extension of the obligation resting on the Crown.  Crown
witnesses, even informants, are not the property of the Crown whom the Crown
can control and produce for examination by the defence.  The obligation of the
Crown does not extend to producing its witnesses for oral discovery. 
Nevertheless, subject to variation by appropriate proceedings, the judgment of
Proulx J.A. was binding on the Crown, and the Court of Appeal (No. 2)
erred in remitting the matter to the trial judge to determine de novo
the terms, content and conditions of disclosure relating to Billy Joe.

 

19               In our view, in the circumstances
referred to above, it would not be appropriate to stay the proceedings without
affording the Crown an opportunity either to comply with the terms of the
judgment of the Court of Appeal (No. 1) or to move to vary it on the basis
of information that has come into the Crown's possession since the date of the
judgment.   

 

III.  Disposition

 

20               In the result, we would allow the
appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and substitute therefor
an order setting aside the stay and requiring the trial to proceed on the
following basis.  Pursuant to the broad powers conferred on this Court by
virtue of s. 695(1) of the Code, we issue the following directions:

 

Subject
to variation by the trial judge on the basis of new evidence relating to the
jeopardy of Billy Joe, the Crown must comply with the terms of the judgment of
the Court of Appeal (No. 1).  There is some difficulty, however, as we
noted earlier in these reasons, with the third requirement in that disclosure
order that Billy Joe be made available to defence counsel, since the informant
appears reluctant to cooperate, and is beyond the Crown's control. 
Accordingly, the Crown has a choice:

 

(1)if
the Crown wishes to avoid the problems already encountered in trying to comply
with the third requirement, the Crown can meet its disclosure obligations by
fully complying with the other two requirements, namely, disclosing the
evidence of the informer before trial, and disclosing the full name and
whereabouts of Billy Joe before trial;

 

(2)alternately,
the Crown can choose to comply with the third requirement by producing Billy
Joe and ensuring that he will cooperate and answer all proper questions.

 

21               The trial judge shall fix a
reasonable time for compliance with the disclosure requirements referred to in
the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  At the end of that period, unless an
application for variation has been brought, the trial judge shall determine
whether the Crown has complied with its disclosure obligations.  If there has
been non-compliance, a stay is the appropriate remedy.  The timing for the
disposition of any motion to vary that may be brought by the Crown within the
period fixed by the trial judge will be for the trial judge to determine.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

22               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- The issue raised by this appeal is whether the trial
judge erred in ordering a stay of proceedings for reasons of unreasonable delay
and non-disclosure of evidence and, consequently, whether the Court of Appeal
was right in overturning that decision and ordering a new trial.  More
particularly, it must be determined whether the Crown properly fulfilled its
disclosure obligations with respect to a police informer.

 

23               Although I agree with my
colleagues that a stay of proceedings should not have been ordered in the case
at hand, I base my conclusion on different premises.  Further, contrary to my
colleagues, I would uphold the judgment of the Court of Appeal.  Before
examining the issue before us, a brief chronology of events is in order.

 

I.  Facts and Proceedings

 

24               On May 30, 1986, the appellants
were arrested and charged with various counts of counselling and conspiracy to
commit the murder of persons aboard an aircraft.  The charges were based on
several conversations between the appellants and a police informer known as
""Billy Joe"".  While the crux of the case against the appellants lies
in these conversations, their exact meaning is in dispute.  The Crown argues
that they are evidence of the alleged conspiracy to bomb an aircraft, while the
appellants suggest that they relate to the stealing of an automobile.

 

25               After waiving their right to a
preliminary inquiry, the appellants appeared before a judge and jury on
November 24, 1986.  They were tried on the conspiracy charges only, as the
charges related to counselling were quashed.  Both appellants were subsequently
found guilty on all conspiracy charges.  With the consent of counsel, the trial
judge, Barrette-Joncas J., applied the rule against multiple convictions and
registered a conviction only with respect to the first count.  On January 28,
1987, both appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment.

 

26               The appellants appealed their
verdicts.  The main focus of the appeal concerned two disclosure applications
that had been brought by the defence at the outset of the trial, and again
before the trial came to an end.  More particularly, the appellants had sought
an order requiring the Crown to produce the informer in order that ""Billy
Joe"", as well as the contents of his potential testimony, be made
available to the defence.  A similar request, prior to the trial, had been made
directly to the Crown which had turned it down.  In the end, both disclosure
applications were dismissed by Barrette-Joncas J. on the grounds that the
informer was protected by the police informer privilege.

 

27               On appeal ((1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d)
81), Proulx J.A., writing for a unanimous court on this point, found
Barrette-Joncas J.'s ruling to be in error and ordered a new trial.  In the
course of his opinion, Proulx J.A. stated (at pp. 92-93):

 

                   With
respect, I am of the opinion that the testimony of the informer was relevant to
(1) the nature of the agreement; (2) the lack of agreement; (3) the lack of
intent; (4) the issue of entrapment (under the existing law at the time), and
(5) in relation to credibility.

 

. . .

 

                   In
summary, the testimony of the informer could have provided evidence on some
crucial facts, mainly, (1) the consideration of the payment of $8,000; (2) the
purpose of the meetings before the meeting with Miele; (3) the nature of the
conversation between Khela and himself before the meeting with Miele; (4) the
discussion held at the restaurant with Miele; (5) the purpose of his contact
with the appellants after Miele's departure from Montreal, and (6) the subject
of the conversations held between the informer and the appellants after meeting
Miele on May 22nd.

 

. . .

 

                   For
these reasons, I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in not ordering
at the request of the appellants that the Crown disclose, (1) the evidence of
the informer before the trial; (2) the full name and whereabouts of Billy Joe,
and (3) that the Crown makes Billy Joe available to the appellants.

 

Herein lies the source of the
confusion which subsequently arose in the proceedings that followed.

 

28               The appellants' new trial took
place before Steinberg J. on March 10, 1992.  On that date, the appellants
brought two applications for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.
24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  They argued that
their s. 7  Charter  rights had been infringed by the Crown's alleged
failure to make full disclosure in accordance with the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and that their s. 7  and 11 (b) rights had been infringed by virtue
of unreasonable delay.

 

29               On March 16, 1992, Steinberg J.
allowed the Charter  applications and entered a stay of proceedings.  The
Crown appealed.  On June 27, 1994, the appeal was allowed ((1994), 92 C.C.C.
(3d) 81), and a new trial was ordered.  It is from this decision that the
appellants appeal to this Court as of right.

 

II.  Analysis

 

30               At the outset, it must be
determined whether the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the first appeal in
fact ordered the Crown to disclose (1) the evidence of the informer
before the trial, (2) his full name and whereabouts, and (3) make him available
to the defence.  In this regard, the Court of Appeal's order simply reads as
follows:

 

                   THE
COURT, on an appeal
against conviction for having conspired to commit the murder of persons aboard
an aircraft, following a trial before judge and jury in the Superior Court
(District of Montreal, December 23, 1986, the Honourable Madam Justice Claire
Barrette-Joncas);

 

                   After
study of the record, hearing of the parties by counsel, and deliberation;

 

                   For
the reasons given in the written opinion of Mr. Justice Claude Vallerand, filed
herewith, with which Madam Justice Christine Tourigny concurs, and for the reasons
given by Mr. Justice Michel Proulx in his written opinion, also filed herewith;

 

                   DOTH
GRANT the appeal;

 

                   DOTH
ORDER a new trial. [Emphasis added.]

 

31               The question thus becomes whether
a disclosure ""order"" can be implied from the terms of the judgment. 
In my view it cannot.  What Proulx J.A.'s opinion, in its relevant portions
reproduced earlier, did was to characterize the error that, in his view, the
trial judge had made.  Outlining such an error, as is regularly done by appellate
courts in similar circumstances, is aimed at providing guidance to trial judges
where new trials are ordered.  Absent a specific order by the court, such
guidelines have never been regarded as binding on either the trial judge or the
parties.  That no such order was even contemplated in this case is illustrated
by the general comments made by Proulx J.A. in the course of his opinion.  He
alluded, in particular, to the possibility of the trial judge's ordering that
the informer be called as a witness without his identity being disclosed (at
pp. 93-94):

 

                   As
a matter of fact, in some cases, trial judges have allowed witnesses to testify
under assumed names in order that they not be obliged to divulge their true
identity . . ., subject, of course, to the proper dispositions being taken for
the security of the witness.  Had the trial judge ruled in favour of the
appellants to order the production of the informer as a witness, that order
could have allowed the witness to testify under his assumed name.

 

32               Simply put, in the first appeal,
the Court of Appeal remitted the whole issue to the trial judge to be dealt
with at the new trial in a manner consistent with the court's decision, i.e.,
that disclosure be made to the defence but subject to the discretion of the
trial judge as to the way in which this should be done.  Given the appellants'
contention, and perhaps the Crown's perception, that the Court of Appeal had
made an ""order"" that the Crown had no choice but to obey, steps were
taken by the Crown to comply with the demands of the defence to the greatest
extent it considered possible under the circumstances which required it to
ensure the protection and security of the informer, a matter Proulx J.A. had
himself considered.

 

33               Before the second trial, the Crown
thus backed away from its initial position taken during the first trial, i.e.,
that it had no disclosure obligation regarding the informer on the basis that
this constituted privileged information, and accordingly provided the defence
with all the information it had, other than the name and whereabouts of the
informer.  Moreover, although it had no direct control over ""Billy
Joe"", the Crown stated that it was willing to do its best to see that the
informer was present at the time of the new trial.

 

34               It must be stressed here that in
the course of the first trial, considerable evidence concerning the informer
had already been brought to the attention of the defence.  This included
details of the informer's twelve-year history in that capacity, details of the
informer's past criminal record, as well as details of the deal that was made
with him in exchange for the information.  The Crown had also made available to
the defence the police officer who had been the informer's contact throughout
the investigation, and provided the defence with transcripts and audiotaped
copies of the wiretapped conversations.  Finally, it should be recalled that,
at this stage, the informer had made no statement in relation to the alleged
conspiracy charges other than the following at p. 87: ""Of course, it's
blowing up airplanes, and the reason I am ready to testify is because I think
it's crazy to conspire to blow up airplanes and to kill hundreds of innocent
people.""  This statement was made available to the defence.

 

35               On February 17, 1992, the Crown
actually produced the informer, be it in such a way as to hide his identity. 
This was done in the context of a meeting at which counsel for both appellants,
as well as counsel for the Crown, were present.  The informer wore a hood in
order to protect his identity, and he was accompanied by two bodyguards.  By
request of the informer, a court reporter was not to be present at the meeting,
nor was the meeting to be tape-recorded.  Counsel for the defence were told
that the informer would answer questions directly related to the specific
issues identified in Proulx J.A.'s opinion.

 

36               Although it was clear that, for
reasons of security, neither the Crown nor the informer wanted the identity and
whereabouts of the informer to be disclosed, the first and only question asked
by defence counsel at the meeting was the informer's name.  The informer refused
to answer this question other than by giving his code name.  Defence counsel
then chose to put an end to the meeting without asking any further question,
stating that they did not believe the hooded man was in fact the true informer,
and persisted in their view that there had been insufficient disclosure, i.e.,
that the Crown had breached Proulx J.A.'s ""order"".  This was the main
basis of the appellants' application for a stay of proceedings at the second
trial, an application which was granted by Steinberg J.

 

37               On appeal to the Court of Appeal
from that stay, Baudouin J.A., writing for the court, discussed the meeting
held between the Crown and the defence during which ""Billy Joe"" was
produced (which I recounted earlier) in the following terms (at pp. 87-88):

 

                   [translation] If I correctly understand
their argument, the respondents are complaining, in essence, that the Crown did
not disclose to them the contents of what, when testifying at the trial, Billy
Joe would say about the alleged conspiracy.  Here, and with the greatest
respect, we are, however, in total darkness, darkness which, it seems to me,
would have been and should have been cleared up if the interview of February
17, 1992, had taken place normally and he had been questioned.

 

. . .

 

                   The
Crown advances, secondly, its discretion and the rule as to the appropriate
timing of the disclosure as laid down in R. v. Stinchcombe
(1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, 9 C.R. (4th) 277 (S.C.C.).  It
argues that on February 17, 1992, disclosure of the name and whereabouts of
Billy Joe was not proper for two main reasons.  The first is that there was a
real danger for the life of this individual who has already been the subject of
a first attempted murder.  The second is that he, represented by counsel, had
indicated that he would ask, at trial, to testify under a pseudonym, which
moreover Proulx J.A. permitted him to do in his judgment.  The Crown's position
is, therefore, that in these particular circumstances, it was for the trial
judge, before the trial had actually begun, to make the necessary decisions in
this regard.  I agree with this position.  [Emphasis added.]

 

38               In my view, Baudouin J.A. was
absolutely right.  The judgment of Proulx J.A. was not binding on either the
trial judge or the parties as regards the content of disclosure and, as a
consequence, it will be for the trial judge to reconsider this issue in light
of all relevant circumstances.

 

39               I would add that there are two
ways by which the matter of disclosure could have been dealt with at the second
trial: either the Crown could have made an application to the trial judge to
set conditions for further disclosure of information concerning the informer,
had such disclosure been found necessary, or the defence, if not satisfied by
the extent of the disclosure, could have applied to the trial judge to order the
Crown to disclose even further information regarding the same.

 

40               In both cases, the matter would
have been fully argued and, in particular, the need to protect the identity of
the police informer, as well as any other circumstances which may have had a
bearing on the requested disclosure order, would have been dealt with.  The
fact that the defence chose, rather, to move for a stay of proceedings does not
give it greater rights than it could have claimed had it followed the proper
route.

 

41               Moreover, assuming, for the sake
of argument, that the Court of Appeal's judgment in the first trial could be
construed as an ""order"" to produce the police informer, it is clear
that such an order would have gone much beyond R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991]
3 S.C.R. 326, i.e., much beyond the type of disclosure that can be ordered by a
trial judge, let alone a Court of Appeal.  The Crown can only be ordered to
produce what it has, and it does not ""have"" people.  I agree with my
colleagues in this respect that ""[t]he obligation of the Crown does not
extend to producing its witnesses for oral discovery"" (at para. 18).  The
appellants' argument on this point must accordingly fail.

 

42               The other issue in dispute in the
present appeal concerns the alleged unreasonable delay which the trial judge
considered in ordering the stay of proceedings.  I agree with my colleagues
that no such unreasonable delay occurred in the circumstances of this case.

 

43               For these reasons, I agree with my
colleagues that a stay of proceedings should not have been granted in the
instant case.  I would, however, uphold the Court of Appeal's order of a new
trial and direct the question of the extent of disclosure to the trial judge. 
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
saskatchewan

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Contempt of court ‑‑ Summary process ‑‑ Appellant
subpoenaed as Crown witness at preliminary inquiry ‑‑ Appellant
insolent and abusive toward presiding judge while refusing to be sworn ‑‑
Appellant convicted of contempt of court instanter ‑‑ Whether
circumstances of demonstrable necessity justified preliminary inquiry judge's
decision to convict and sentence appellant without a hearing and without
providing reasonable opportunity to retain and consult counsel.

 

                   The appellant was
subpoenaed as a Crown witness to a preliminary inquiry involving a charge of
attempted murder against two accused.  He attended but refused to be sworn and
was insolent and abusive toward the presiding judge.  The judge convicted him
of contempt of court instanter, with no notice or show cause hearing and
no reasonable opportunity for him to speak with a lawyer.  As a result of the
appellant's refusal to testify and the victim's failure to appear to give
evidence, the presiding judge discharged both accused.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant's appeal against conviction.  It appeared to be of the
opinion that the judge was justified in using the instanter contempt
procedure in order to maintain jurisdiction over the appellant, since once the
appellant refused to testify, the judge had no choice but to bring the
preliminary inquiry to an end and therefore could not adjourn it and bring the
appellant back at some later time to deal with the contempt issue.

 

                   Held (Major J. dissenting):  The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction for contempt quashed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and
Iacobucci JJ.:  The ability of a judge to forego the formal trappings of a
criminal trial and summarily punish for contempt has been recognized by this
Court on a number of occasions and has received Parliamentary approval in
s. 10  of the Criminal Code .  The notion of citing in contempt
should be used not as an expression of a finding of contempt but rather as a
method of providing the accused with notice that he or she has been
contemptuous and will be required to show cause why he or she should not be
held in contempt.  The instanter summary procedure was not justified in
this case, since there were no circumstances which made it urgent and
imperative to act immediately to convict and sentence the appellant instantly
for contempt of court.  A court's exercise of its contempt power should be
restrained by the principle that only the least possible power adequate to the
end proposed should be used.  The preliminary inquiry judge was not operating
under s. 545 of the Code, which enables a judge to adjourn the
inquiry and commit the recalcitrant witness, but under s. 484 , which
provides a judge with ""the same power and authority to preserve order in a
court over which he presides as may be exercised by the superior court of
criminal jurisdiction"".  It was not the refusal to testify that the judge
was dealing with in finding the appellant guilty of contempt but rather the
manner in which he behaved when called as a witness.  While the presiding judge
was amply justified in initiating the summary contempt procedures, there was no
justification for foregoing the usual steps, required by natural justice, of
putting the witness on notice that he must show cause why he would not be found
in contempt of court, followed by an adjournment which need be no longer than
that required to offer the witness an opportunity to be advised by counsel and,
if he chooses, to be represented by counsel.  In addition, upon a finding of
contempt there should be an opportunity to have representations made as to what
would be an appropriate sentence.  This was not done and there was no need to
forego all of these steps.

 

                   Per Major J. (dissenting):  While
there must be an urgent and imperative need to treat the contempt instanter,
the words ""urgent"" and ""imperative"" should be given a
contextual meaning, to allow for their application in varying circumstances. 
The nature of the loutish and obscene behaviour of the appellant in this case
demanded immediate response.  While the safeguards of notice and the
opportunity to speak to a lawyer occupy an important place in our
jurisprudence, the deliberate and calculated conduct of the appellant makes it
apparent that they would have served no purpose in this case.  The preliminary
inquiry judge, who was in the best position to determine the steps necessary to
maintain order in the courtroom and preserve the dignity of the judicial
system, decided to use the instanter procedure.  The situation made it
imperative to act immediately.  The judge obviously concluded that the
procedural steps normally required by natural justice would not be of any
benefit in the situation he faced.  That his decision was correct is supported
by the fact that the appellant continued his disruptive behaviour during and
after the finding of contempt, until he was removed.

Lamer C.J. and La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin
and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

I.                 Lamer
C.J. -- The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether there existed
circumstances of demonstrable necessity justifying the preliminary inquiry
judge's decision to convict and sentence instanter the appellant of
contempt of court in the absence of a hearing and without providing a
reasonable opportunity for the appellant to retain and consult counsel. The
broader issue of whether the common law rule which permits a judge to act in
such a manner is constitutionally infirm does not arise on the facts of this
case and was not raised by the appellant in oral argument. I therefore leave it
for another day.

 

I.Factual
Background

 

II.                The appellant was subpoenaed as a
Crown witness to a preliminary inquiry involving a charge of attempted murder
against two other accused. The victim was also subpoenaed but failed to attend
the preliminary inquiry. The appellant attended the preliminary inquiry but
refused to be sworn as a witness. In expressing his refusal to testify, the
appellant was insolent and abusive towards the presiding judge as the following
transcript of events reflects:

 

CLERK:Mr.
K., do you want to step into the witness box, please.

 

B.K.:Okay.

 

CLERK:You
have to stand up to be sworn.

 

B.K.:Oh,
fuck.

 

CLERK:Please
take the Bible in your right hand. Please state your full name for the Court.

 

B.K.:B.C.K.

 

CLERK:Spell
your last name.

 

B.K.:K.

 

CLERK:Do
you swear that the evidence you shall give touching the matters in question
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?

 

B.K.:Fuck
it, man, I ain't testifying.

 

COURT:I'm
sorry, I didn't hear you.

 

B.K.:I
ain't testifying, man.  Fucking charge me.  Whatever you fucking want, man.  I
ain't testifying.

 

III.               According to the presiding judge,
in his report to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, the appellant then threw the
Bible on the floor immediately in front of the witness box, sat down in the
box, sat back, crossed his arms and put his foot up on the railing of the
witness box. Following this behaviour, the judge stated:

 

COURT:I
find you guilty of contempt of in the face of this Court.

 

B.K.:Up
yours, you dick.

 

COURT:And
I sentence you to a period of incarceration of six months consecutive to any --

 

B.K.:Fuck
you, you goof.

 

COURT:...time
now being served.

 

B.K.:Goof.

 

COURT:Get
him out of here.

 

B.K.:Fucking
goof.

 

FIELD:I
think that my case has not been advanced much by that witness's attendance.

 

COURT:That
would seem to be the case.

 

FIELD:And
I have no further evidence to call.

 

COURT:All
right.  Do you wish to address any argument?

 

NO
AUDIBLE RESPONSE

 

COURT:With
respect to this Information 1870787 I hereby discharge both accused.

 

                                                                    ...

 

COURT:Incidentally,
for the record, he's not fit to be brought in to -- to indicate that it's
closed custody by reason of his attitude, so it's not appropriate for him to be
in court. 

 

IV.              As the transcript reveals the judge
convicted the appellant of contempt of court instanter, that is, the
conviction and sentence were instantaneous. There was no notice provided or a
show cause hearing and no reasonable opportunity for the appellant to speak
with a lawyer. As a result of the appellant's refusal to testify and the
victim's failure to appear to give evidence, the presiding judge discharged
both accused. 

 

V.                The appellant appealed his
conviction and sentence to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. On September 6,
1994, Lane J.A. for the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction
and allowed the appeal against sentence, reducing it to three months: (1994),
125 Sask. R. 183, 81 W.A.C. 183. The appellant appeals his conviction to this
Court.

VII.             In dismissing the appellant's
appeal, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal appeared to be of the opinion that the
judge was justified in using the instanter contempt procedure in order
to maintain jurisdiction over the appellant. According to the court, once the
appellant refused to testify, the judge had no choice but to bring the
preliminary inquiry to an end. He therefore could not adjourn it and bring the
appellant back at some later time to deal with the contempt issue. Lane J.A.,
for the court, held (at pp. 184-85):

 

                   The
Provincial Court judge did not use the procedures established by s. 545  of the Criminal
Code  and we find no error in his not doing so.  Once the accused refused to
testify and the victim refused to attend the preliminary inquiry, the Crown had
no case.  In these circumstances with the accused already incarcerated,
adjourning the preliminary inquiry and imprisoning the accused would not likely
have served any purpose.  The judge had no choice but to end the inquiry and
could not adjourn it to bring the accused back at some later date as set out in
that provision. As well, the accused was already incarcerated.  We see no
error in principle and recognize there may be exceptional circumstances
requiring the judge to act to protect the dignity and authority of the court.

III.Analysis

 

(a)The
Summary Nature of the Contempt Process

 

VIII.            The ability of a judge to forego the
formal trappings of a criminal trial and summarily, and in some cases
instantly, punish for contempt is a power that is recognized in England (see Morris
v. Crown Office, [1970] 1 All E.R. 1079 (C.A.); C. J. Miller, Contempt
of Court (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 45-96, and s. 12 of the Contempt of
Court Act 1981 (U.K.), 1981, c. 49) and for ""petty""
contempt offences in the United States (see Sacher v. United States, 343
U.S. 1 (1952); Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968); Rule 42(a) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and 18 U.S.C. § 401. According to Baldwin
v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970), at p. 69, a ""petty"" offence is
one with a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment.)

 

IX.              On a number of occasions, this
Court has also recognized the summary nature of the contempt process. (See R.
v. Vermette, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 577, at pp. 582-83, and Paul v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 169.) In United Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney
General), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, at p. 924, Cory J. and I held, in dissent
but not on this point, ""[a] criminal contempt hearing is held as a
summary proceeding"" (emphasis added). In B.C.G.E.U. v. British
Columbia (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214, at p. 238, Dickson C.J.,
speaking for the majority (reasons in which I concurred), approved of the
following comments of Lord Denning in Balogh v. Crown Court at St. Albans,
[1974] 3 All E.R. 283 (C.A.), at pp. 287-88:

 

                   Gathering
together the experience of the past, then whatever expression is used, a judge
of one of the superior courts or a judge of assize could always punish
summarily of his own motion for contempt of court whenever there was a gross
interference with the court of justice in a case that was being tried, or about
to be tried, or just over -- no matter whether the judge saw it with his own
eyes or it was reported to him by the officers of the court, or by others --
whenever it was urgent and imperative to act at once.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   This
power of summary punishment is a great power, but it is a necessary power.
It is given so as to maintain the dignity and authority of the judge and to
ensure a fair trial. It is to be exercised by the judge of his own motion
only when it is urgent and imperative to act immediately -- so as to maintain
the authority of the court -- to prevent disorder -- to enable witnesses to be
free from fear -- and jurors from being improperly influenced -- and the like.
It is, of course, to be exercised with scrupulous care, and only when the case
is clear and beyond reasonable doubt.... But properly exercised, it is a
power of the utmost value and importance which should not be curtailed.
[Emphasis added.]

 

So too Parliament has approved of the
summary procedure by virtue of enacting s. 10  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 . Section 10  states: 

 

                   10. (1) Where a court, judge, justice or
provincial court judge summarily convicts a person for a contempt of court
committed in the face of the court and imposes punishment in respect
thereof, that person may appeal

 

(a)
from the conviction; or

 

                          (b)
against the punishment imposed.

 

                   (2)
Where a court or judge summarily convicts a person for a contempt of court
not committed in the face of the court and punishment is imposed in respect
thereof, that person may appeal

 

                   (a)
from the conviction; or

 

                   (b)
against the punishment imposed. [Emphasis added.]

 

(b)The
Terminology of Contempt: Citation, Conviction and Punishment

 

X.                It is perhaps important at the
outset to clarify the terminology that is sometimes used in contempt cases to
describe what is being done by the judge in exercising his or her contempt
power. This power is commonly expressed, in the English and American jurisprudence
and s. 9  of the Criminal Code , as the judge's power to punish for
contempt. (See Borrie and Lowe's Law of Contempt (2nd ed. 1983), at p.
314, and Bloom v. Illinois, supra, at pp. 202-4.)  What has
emerged in the cases is a host of expressions to describe the process by which
a judge arrives at the punishment stage. For example, it is not uncommon to see
references to ""cite"", ""hold"" or ""find"".  A
commonly used phrase in the American and Canadian cases is ""cite"" or
""citation"" for contempt. This Court has also used that expression in
several cases including Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994]
3 S.C.R. 835, at p. 862, wherein I stated, in the context of third party
appeals to this Court:

 

                   Some
concern was voiced that this appeal could lead to appeals brought directly to
this Court by witnesses at criminal trials. There is no need for such concern.
The problem for a witness most frequently arises out of a citation for
contempt for refusal to testify. It is true that pursuant to s. 9  of the Criminal
Code  a judge may cite persons, including witnesses, for contempt of
court. Yet s. 10 of the Code sets out the procedure for bringing a
conviction for contempt before a court of appeal. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

XI.              In
order to simplify matters, it is my opinion that we should use the notion of
citing in contempt, not as an expression of a finding of contempt but instead,
as a method of providing the accused with notice that he or she has been
contemptuous and will be required to show cause why they should not be held in
contempt. This is what I meant in Dagenais when I used the words
""citation"" and ""cite"". I did not intend them to be equated
with a conviction. Indeed, in the French version these words are expressed as
""assignation"" and ""assigner ... à comparaître"". 
These terms, which in the French language call to mind the notion of a
subpoena, indicate that the effect of a citation or ""assignation""
is to require the person to appear in court.  This is also consistent with what
occurred in Reference re Milgaard, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 875, wherein we cited
a witness in contempt but later stayed the matter where it was no longer
necessary to deal summarily with the witness's conduct under oath.

 

XII.             Support
for this view to equate a citation with notification comes from the definition
of ""cite"" and ""citation"" in Black's Law Dictionary
(6th ed. 1990), at pp. 243-44. ""Citation"" is defined as:

 

A writ issued out of a court of competent jurisdiction,
commanding a person therein named to appear on a day named and do something
therein mentioned, or show cause why he should not. [Emphasis added.]

 

while
""cite"" is defined as:

 

To summon; to command the presence of a person; to
notify a person of legal proceedings against him and require his appearance
thereto.

 

So too, it
appears that in a number of Canadian jurisdictions, judges issue a citation or
cite for contempt prior to holding a hearing for notification purposes. (See
for example R. v. Martin (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 248 (Ont. C.A.), at p.
251, and R. v. Jolly (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 389 (B.C.C.A.).) This is
also consistent with the American approach (Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S.
337 (1970), at pp. 344-45).

 

(c)Was the ""Instanter"" Summary Procedure
Justified in This Case?

 

XIII.            The
narrow issue raised by the appellant in this case is whether, to quote Lord
Denning in Balogh, supra, at pp. 287-88, there existed
circumstances which made it ""urgent and imperative to act
immediately"" to convict and sentence the appellant instantly for contempt
of court. In answering this question, I am guided by the wisdom of Burger C.J.
in United States v. Wilson, 421 U.S. 309 (1975), at p. 319, who held
that a court's exercise of its contempt power should be restrained by the
principle that ""only `[t]he least possible power adequate to the end
proposed' should be used ..."".

 

XIV.           In
this case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that matters were being dealt
with under s. 545  of the Criminal Code , which enables a judge to adjourn
the inquiry and commit the recalcitrant witness; and that since the justice was
choosing to discharge the accused, he was justified in proceeding ""instanter""
because his jurisdiction over the witness would be spent. However, the
inquiring justice was clearly not operating under that section of the Code
but rather under s. 484 of the Code, which provides a judge or
provincial court judge with ""the same power and authority to preserve
order in a court over which he presides as may be exercised by the superior
court of criminal jurisdiction ..."". It was not the refusal to testify
that the judge was dealing with in finding the appellant guilty of contempt but
rather the manner in which he behaved when called as a witness.

 

XV.             There
is no doubt in my mind that he was amply justified in initiating the summary
contempt procedures. I, however, find no justification for foregoing the usual
steps, required by natural justice, of putting the witness on notice that he or
she must show cause why they would not be found in contempt of court, followed
by an adjournment which need be no longer than that required to offer the
witness an opportunity to be advised by counsel and, if he or she chooses, to
be represented by counsel. In addition, upon a finding of contempt there should
be an opportunity to have representations made as to what would be an
appropriate sentence. This was not done and there was no need to forego all of
these steps. 

 

XVI.           Having
concluded that the instanter procedure was not justified in the
circumstances of this case, it is my further opinion that there may be some
exceptional cases, involving misbehaviour in court, where the failure to take
one or all of the steps I have outlined above will be justified subject to
whatever qualifications might be warranted in the context of a Charter
challenge to instanter proceedings.

 

IV.Disposition

 

XVII.          I
am of the view that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction for
contempt quashed. In light of the facts presented in this case I would normally
order a hearing. However, the appellant has served his sentence and therefore I
will comply with the request made by both the appellant and respondent and stay
the proceedings.

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

XVIII.         Major J. (dissenting) -- I
agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice that the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal erred in holding that the jurisdiction for an immediate conviction and
sentence for contempt of court was that the preliminary inquiry judge's
jurisdiction to deal with the question of contempt would terminate at the
conclusion of the preliminary.  As the Chief Justice points out the
jurisdiction of the Provincial Court judge in dealing with contempt was derived
from s. 484 and not s. 545  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
and would continue beyond the conclusion of the preliminary hearing.  I agree
as well with his outline of the procedure to be followed in the usual case of
contempt.

 

XIX.            The
Chief Justice confirms the jurisdiction of courts, in certain circumstances, to
treat the contempt ""instanter"" but concludes that, by the test
enunciated in Balogh v. Crown Court at St. Albans, [1974] 3 All E.R.
283, there must be an urgent and imperative need to do so.  He concluded that
here those ingredients were missing.  It is with that conclusion that I
disagree.  The words urgent and imperative should be given a contextual
meaning, to allow for their application in varying circumstances.  The range of
conduct giving rise to contempt may be as high as civil insurrection or more
modestly bringing the administration of justice at a preliminary hearing into
disrepute and thwarting its objectives as was the case in this appeal.

 

XX.             The
facts giving rise to the finding of contempt are set out in the reasons of the
Chief Justice.  The nature of the loutish and obscene behaviour of the accused
demanded immediate response.  It is idle in my opinion to speak of the need to
provide the accused in this case with notice of possible contempt proceedings
or to afford him the opportunity to speak to a lawyer.

 

XXI.            While
these safeguards occupy an important place in our jurisprudence the deliberate
and calculated conduct of the accused makes it apparent that they would have
served no purpose in this case.

 

XXII.          A
review of the facts amply demonstrates the absence of a single mitigating
circumstance.  This was not an occasion where a citizen was caught in the
machinery of the state and provoked or scared into inappropriate conduct in
court.

 

XXIII.         The
accused in this case was a young offender with a record of past offences.  It
is apparent that his abusive, vulgar and sustained response to the presiding
judge was deliberate and premeditated.  It was conduct contemptuous of the
court and the administration of justice.

 

XXIV.         The
preliminary inquiry judge, who was in the best position to determine the steps
necessary to maintain order in the courtroom and preserve the dignity of the
judicial system, decided to use the instanter procedure.  The situation
as described made it imperative to act immediately.  The judge obviously
concluded that the procedural steps normally required by natural justice would
not be of any benefit in the situation he faced.  That his decision was correct
is supported by the fact that the appellant continued his disruptive behaviour
during and after the finding of contempt, until he was removed.

 

XXV.          In
my opinion the requirement of deterrence, public opprobrium and rehabilitation
are factors to be considered in the penalty for contempt and the failure of the
presiding judge to act as he did would have diminished all three.

 

XXVI.         I
agree with the caution expressed by Lord Denning in Balogh that the
power of summary punishment is a great but necessary one that is to be used
with scrupulous care.  I am confident that the judiciary in Canada appreciate
that requirement and in those instances where it is ignored there are remedies
to correct it.

 

XXVII.       For
the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the conviction for
contempt of court.

          J is the sole officer
of the co-accused company which owns and operates an adult video store.  Undercover
police agents purchased eight videotapes from that store and, despite the fact
that the Ontario Film Review Board (""OFRB"") had approved all of them,
J and his company were charged with eight counts of ""knowingly""
selling obscene material ""without lawful justification or excuse""
contrary to s. 163(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .  The trial
judge found three of the eight videos to be obscene within the meaning of
s. 163(8) of the Code because some of their scenes portray explicit
sex coupled with violence.  She also found that, with respect to the mens
rea for a s. 163(2)  offence, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused are aware of the presence or nature of the matter that
constitutes the subject of the charge in a general sense. It is not necessary
that the Crown prove the accused were aware of the specific factual contents of
the forbidden material at issue. The trial judge rejected the arguments made by
the accused that the OFRB approval negates any possibility that an accused
acted knowingly, or constitutes a lawful justification or excuse. The accused
were convicted on the three counts relating to the obscene videos.  The Court
of Appeal upheld the convictions.  

          Held:  The
appeal is allowed and a verdict of acquittal entered.

 

          Per La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and
Major JJ.: It is a general rule of statutory construction that the term
""knowingly"" used in a criminal statute applies to all elements of the
actus reus, and there is nothing in the language of s. 163(2) , or
in its legislative history, to suggest that the word ""knowingly""
should be given a restricted meaning.  In including the word
""knowingly"" in s. 163(2) , Parliament chose to set an onerous
standard of proof in the case of sellers or retailers.  Thus, to satisfy the mens
rea requirement of the offence under s. 163(2) , the Crown must show
not only that the retailer was aware that the subject matter of the material
had as its dominant characteristic the exploitation of sex, but also that he
knew of the specific acts which make the material obscene in law.  Material is
generally obscene if it involves explicit sex with violence, or explicit sex
which is degrading or dehumanizing.  If the court is unable to specify any
particular scene but still concludes that, overall, the film is obscene in law,
then sufficient proof must be offered to show that the retailer was aware of
the ""overall"" obscene nature of the film.

 

          A retailer, however,
will not be immune from charges merely because he does not know how the law
defines obscenity.  This would amount to the defence of mistake of law and it
is well established that ignorance of the law is no defence.  Further, proof
that a retailer had ""knowledge"" that he was selling obscene material
does not necessarily require the Crown to prove that he actually viewed the
obscene material.  ""Knowledge"" of the obscene character of the film
can be acquired by means other than direct viewing.  In this regard, in
appropriate circumstances, the Crown can avail itself of the principles of
wilful blindness.  Deliberately choosing not to know something when there are
reasons to believe further inquiry is necessary can satisfy the mental element
of the offence.  The approval of a film by a provincial censor board may be
relevant to the issue of wilful blindness.

 

          The accused's reliance
on the OFRB approval does not negate the mens rea of the offence.  The
OFRB screens and classifies films, but it is not its function to determine
whether a film is obscene.  While the approval of a film by a provincial censor
board may be relevant to the determination of community standards of tolerance,
the approval is not relevant with respect to the issue of the accused's
knowledge.  The question whether a film exceeds community standards of
tolerance may be characterized as a question of mixed fact and law.  As such,
the Crown need not generally prove intent or knowledge where these mind states
are otherwise an essential ingredient of the offence, nor can the accused rely
on a mistake of fact in relation to the issue.  Accordingly, if the Crown
establishes that the accused knew of the presence of the specific acts or set
of facts in the film which the court finds exceed community standards, that is
sufficient for a conviction.  The Crown need not prove that the accused knew
that the film exceeded community standards.  

 

          Furthermore, approval
by a provincial censor board does not constitute a justification or excuse. 
First, one level of government cannot delegate its legislative powers to
another.  Second, approval by a provincial body cannot as a matter of
constitutional law preclude the criminal prosecution of a charge under the Criminal
Code .  In using the words ""lawful justification or excuse"",
Parliament did not intend that conduct which is criminalized by s. 163(2) 
be rendered lawful, or that the person engaging in it be excused, as a result
of a decision of a provincial body.  

 

          Since there was no
evidence in this case to suggest any knowledge on the part of the accused,
beyond the fact that the videos in question were sex films in the general sense
that they involved the exploitation of sex, the Crown did not satisfy the mens
rea requirements of s. 163(2)  and the accused are entitled to an
acquittal.

 

          The issue of officially
induced error of law as an excuse has not been considered in this appeal
because the matter was not raised either here or in the courts below.  It would
be preferable to address this issue in a case in which it is properly raised
and argued.

 

          Per
Lamer C.J.:  There is agreement with Sopinka J.'s reasons on the question
of the requisite mens rea for the offence under s. 163(2)  of the Criminal
Code , and with his conclusion that the OFRB approval of a film cannot
negative the mens rea of this offence.  On the question of whether the
accused acted ""without lawful justification or excuse"", while the OFRB
approval of the films did not justify the accused's criminal actions, in the
circumstances of this case it would have permitted the accused to be excused
from conviction on the basis of an officially induced error of law.  Officially
induced error of law is an exception to the rule that ignorance of the law does
not excuse which is codified in s. 19  of the Criminal Code . Like
the other exceptions to this rule, it ensures that the morally blameless are
not made criminally responsible for their actions.  

          Allowing OFRB approval
to constitute an excuse is not an impermissible delegation of power from one
level of government to another.  Officially induced error of law can only be
raised after the Crown has proven all elements of the offence.  As this excuse
is considered only after culpability has been proven, there is no issue of the
action of a provincial board precluding criminal prosecutions.  Further, advice
from an official of any level of government can meet the test for this excuse.

 

          There is no particular
link between the phrase ""without lawful justification or excuse"" and
officially induced error of law.  Where an accused raises an officially induced
error of law argument, the trial judge must assess whether the excuse is made
out in law, regardless of the wording of the offence.  Officially induced error
is distinct from a defence of due diligence and is applicable to regulatory as
well as criminal offences.

 

          In order for an accused
to rely on an officially induced error as an excuse, he must show, after
establishing he made an error of law (or of mixed law and fact), that he
considered his legal position, consulted an appropriate official, obtained
reasonable advice and relied on that advice in his actions.  When considering
the legal consequences of his actions, it is insufficient for an accused who
wishes to benefit from this excuse to simply have assumed that his conduct was
permissible.  The advice came from an appropriate official if that official was
one whom a reasonable individual in the position of the accused would normally
consider responsible for advice about the particular law in question.  If an
appropriate official is consulted, the advice obtained will generally be
presumed to be reasonable unless it appears on its face to be utterly
unreasonable.  The advice relied on by the accused must also have been
erroneous, but this fact does not need to be demonstrated by the accused. 
Reliance on the official advice can be shown by proving that the advice was
obtained before the actions in question were commenced and by showing that the
questions posed to the official were specifically tailored to the accused's
situation.  

          A successful
application of an officially induced error of law argument will lead to a
judicial stay of proceedings.  As a stay can only be entered in the clearest of
cases, an officially induced error of law argument will only be successful in
the clearest of cases.  Finally, the question of whether officially induced
error constitutes an excuse in law is a question of law or of mixed law and
fact.  While a jury may determine whether the accused is culpable, and hence
whether this argument is necessary, it is for a judge to determine whether the
precise conditions for this legal excuse are made out and if a stay should be
entered.  The elements of officially induced error are to be proven on a
balance of probabilities by the accused.

 

          Since the accused are
entitled to an acquittal in this case, nothing turns on the application of an
officially induced error of law analysis.  Had the accused had the requisite mens
rea for the s. 163(2)  offence, however, they would have been entitled
to a judicial stay of proceedings as a result of officially induced error of
law.  The argument put forward by the accused would have been one based on
error of law ‑‑ the conclusion that the films they retailed were
not legally obscene; the accused sought the OFRB opinion on these films and
relied on its advice; and the OFRB was the appropriate official body to consult
when seeking a determination about whether a film can be legally sold in
Ontario.

C.J. --

 

I. Introduction

 

1     This appeal from a conviction under s. 163(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 , raises two issues for our consideration because of the wording
of the section: (i) did the accused ""knowingly"" sell obscene
material? and (ii) did he do so ""without lawful justification or
excuse""?  Regarding the first issue, the question of the requisite mens
rea for this offence, I agree with the reasons of my colleague Justice
Sopinka.  In particular, I concur in his conclusion that the law requires the
Crown to prove that an accused retailer knew of the specific acts or set of facts
which lead the court to the conclusion that the material in question is
obscene.  The Crown is not, of course, required to prove that the accused knew
the material was obscene in law, nor is the Crown required to prove that an
accused actually viewed the obscene material.  As my colleague has pointed out,
there are other ways to acquire knowledge of the obscene character of a film. 
In addition, I concur in Sopinka J.'s conclusion that approval of a film by the
Ontario Film Review Board (""OFRB"") cannot negative the mens rea
of this offence.  Accordingly, I concur in Sopinka J.'s disposition of the
appeal; the accused are entitled to be acquitted.

 

2     On the second issue raised by this appeal, the question of whether the accused acted
without lawful justification or excuse, I disagree with Sopinka J.'s
conclusion.  In my view, the circumstances of this case permit the accused to
be excused from conviction on the basis of an officially induced error of law
by virtue of the OFRB's approval of the films in question.  While I do not
believe film board approval negatives mens rea or justifies the
accused's criminal actions, I believe that reasonable reliance on this type of
official advice is sufficient basis for a judicial stay of proceedings to be
entered.  Requiring that a stay be entered only in the clearest of officially
induced error of law cases does not offend the maxim that ignorance of the law
does not excuse.  Rather, it provides an exception from this provision, in line
with the existing exceptions, which ensures that the morally blameless are not
made criminally responsible for their actions.  

 

3     To elaborate my conclusions, I will first examine the rationale of the  ignorantia
juris neminem excusat maxim which is one of the backbones of our criminal
law.  Next I will consider emerging trends in Canadian cases, and briefly
examine the American position.  I will then outline how I propose that the
officially induced error of law excusing provision be limited.  Finally, I will
demonstrate why I believe the accused in this case would have been entitled to
a judicial stay of proceedings had the mens rea requirement for
culpability been met.

 

II. Analysis

 

A. Ignorance of the Law Does
not Excuse

 

4     While mistakes of fact relevant to the commission of a criminal offence  excuse an
accused from criminal responsibility, mistakes regarding the law do not.  There
is no significant difference between a mistake of law and ignorance of the law
(see Molis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 356).  The common law rule that
ignorance of the law does not excuse the commission of a criminal offence is
codified in s. 19  of the Criminal Code :

 

          19. Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an
offence is not an excuse for committing that offence. 

 

This principle is a significant
barrier to the appellants here because the question of whether or not a film is
obscene is a question of law, specifically a question of the interpretation and
application of the definition of obscenity contained in s. 163(8)  of the Criminal
Code .  

 

5     Don Stuart identifies four aspects of the rationale for the rule against accepting
ignorance of the law as an excuse:

 

1.Allowing a defence of ignorance of the law would involve the courts
in insuperable evidential problems.

 

2.It would encourage ignorance where knowledge is socially desirable.

 

3.Otherwise every person would be a law unto himself, infringing the
principle of legality and contradicting the moral principles underlying the
law.

 

4.Ignorance of the law is blameworthy in itself.

 

(Canadian
Criminal Law: A Treatise (3rd ed. 1995), at pp. 295-98.)

 

While Stuart finds the rule
against ignorance of the law crude, and these principles unconvincing in the
present era, this maxim is an orienting principle of our criminal law which
should not be lightly disturbed.  I have concluded that certain types of
officially induced errors of law should be permitted to excuse an individual
from criminal sanction for his actions, in part because I find that this does
not infringe any of the four rationales for the ignorance of the law rule set
out above.

 

6     Despite the importance of this rule, some exceptions to it are already well
established in our law.  An accused is excused when the law she was charged
under was impossible to gain knowledge of because it had not been published. 
In addition, a certain number of our Criminal Code  offences provide an
excuse for an accused who acted with colour of right.  The existence of these
exceptions demonstrates that the ignorantia juris rule is not to be
applied when it would render a conviction manifestly unjust.

 

7     Academic commentators for some time now have argued that a form of an officially
induced error of law doctrine should be accepted by the courts as an
exoneration from criminal responsibility.  Reviewing the tentative steps taken
by judges towards this defence, Stuart asserts that courts to date have been
""too timid"".  He advocates a full defence, which would consider
whether reliance on a particular statement of the law was reasonable, and
states (at p. 317):

 

None
of the four suggested rationales for the ignorance of the law rule is
undermined.  Such a defence is capable of proof, and the accused can
demonstrate that he was sociably responsible, not lawless and not blameworthy. 
Like the claim of right defence, we are considering only those who were not
simply ignorant of law but made a mistake.  The recognition of a common law
defence of reliance on advice as to the law is a very healthy development in
our criminal law and substantially ameliorates the harsh ignorance of the law
rule.  It is vastly preferable to the devious [case cite omitted] device of
classifying the mistake made as one of mistake of fact rather than law.

 

8     The difficulty of distinguishing errors of fact from errors of law is also the
starting point for Professor Barton's critique.  Barton argues in support of a
full justification defence which would remove the need to distinguish between
errors of fact and errors of law.  He would support a defence for an accused
whose reliance on advice is reasonable, and he finds it difficult to
distinguish advice from an official of a government agency charged with
administering the law from advice given by a lawyer or a police officer.  The
starting point of Barton's analysis is an assessment of moral blameworthiness:

 

Because
it is so difficult to fashion an adequate test to help distinguish between
mistake of fact and of law, and because judges spend so much time focussing on
this issue and miss the ultimate question of the effect, if any, of the
mistake, perhaps it is time to abandon the distinction and to look at the
position of the accused from the point of view of ""should the accused be
excused?""

 

(P.
G. Barton, ""Officially Induced Error as a Criminal Defence: A Preliminary
Look"" (1979-80), 22 Crim. L.Q. 314, at p. 315.)

 

From this perspective of moral
blameworthiness, it is difficult to justify convicting an individual who has
considered that her behaviour may be illegal,  consulted an appropriate
authority regarding the legality of her actions, and relied on the advice she
obtained in a way that appears objectively reasonable.  

 

9     Discussing the defence which he would name ""state-induced error of law"",
in the context of reliance on a judicial decision which was later overturned,
Terence Arnold states:

 

          The
principle that ignorance or mistake of law constitutes no defence is treated by
many as expressing a proposition of self-evident utility and necessity.  So
simple and absolute a rule may have been appropriate at a time when the
criminal law was narrow in scope and therefore fundamental in nature.  It is not
appropriate in a modern legal context, however.  In recognition of this many
courts and legislatures have reassessed the doctrine, retaining it in respect
to certain offences or situations, modifying in respect to others.  My
criticism of the Court in the Dunn case [(1977), 21 N.S.R. (2d) 334] is
not that they accept the basic mistake of law doctrine -- s. 19 of the Code
compels them to do that.  It is, rather, that the Court shows no sensitivity to
the fact that [the] doctrine's applicability in some situations requires
reconsideration.  Furthermore, in order to apply the doctrine to the fact
situation urged in Dunn the Court had to apply a legal theory, long
since abandoned by legal analysts, which has no connection with reality, does
not achieve individual justice and cannot be justified on public policy
grounds.

 

(""State-Induced
Error of Law, Criminal Liability and Dunn v. The Queen: A Recent
Non-Development in Criminal Law"" (1978), 4 Dalhousie L.J. 559, at
pp. 584-85.)

 

Arnold's sense of injustice is
perhaps overly sensitive, but his point reflects our contemporary reality.  The
number of laws under which any person in Canada may incur criminal liability is
nothing short of astounding.  While knowledge of the law is to be encouraged,
it is certainly reasonable for someone to assume he knows the law after
consulting a representative of the state acting in a capacity which makes him
expert on that particular subject.  

 

10    Nancy S. Kastner also urges that a defence of officially induced error of law be
accepted by the courts:

 

.
. . the traditional rationalia for the rule that ignorance of the law does not
excuse are not done violence by the incursion of the defence of officially
induced error, where the offender in good faith is duly diligent in attempting
to guide his conduct by the law as stated by ""a party in the know"".

L.Q. 308, at p. 335.)

 

In its Report 30 entitled Recodifying
the Criminal Law (1986), the Law Reform Commission of Canada proposed the
following provision as part of a new General Part of the Criminal Code 
(at p. 31):

 

3(7)Mistake or Ignorance of Law.  No one is liable for a crime
committed by reason of mistake or ignorance of law:

 

(a)concerning private rights relevant to that crime; or

 

(b)reasonably resulting from 

 

(i)       non-publication of the law in question, 

 

(ii)reliance on a decision of a court of appeal in the province having
jurisdiction over the crime charged, or

 

(iii) reliance on competent administrative authority. [Emphasis
added.]

 

In a working paper which preceded
this draft, the Law Reform Commission proposed extending a ""reliance on
administrative authority"" excuse only to offences outside the Criminal
Code  (Working Paper 29, Criminal Law -- The General Part: Liability and
Defences (1982), at p. 82).  The shift between that provision and the final
report indicates a broader approach to an officially induced error of law
provision.

 

11    This steady trickle of academic commentary has been fuelled by tentative steps
toward the recognition of officially induced error of law as either a complete
defence or an excusing provision by Canadian jurists, as well as more
widespread support for this defence in the United States.  Before outlining the
precise form this doctrine should take, I will examine some of this
jurisprudence to illustrate situations where this doctrine will assist judges
in achieving just results.

 

B. Developments in the
Jurisprudence

 

12    The defence of officially induced error of law emerged in American jurisprudence
with the 1949 case of Long v. State, 65 A.2d 489 (Del.).  In that case a
man who had obtained a divorce in Arkansas returned to his native Delaware,
married for a second time, and was convicted of bigamy.  He presented evidence
that he had consulted a reputable attorney before going to Arkansas to obtain
the divorce, and again upon his return to Delaware, regarding the legal effect
in Delaware of his divorce.  The Reverend who performed the second marriage
sought and obtained the same advice, and the lawyer who had advised them both
signed the marriage application.  The Supreme Court of Delaware ordered a new
trial where the jury would be instructed to consider this evidence based on a
defence that ""before engaging in the [prohibited] conduct, the defendant
made a bona fide, diligent effort, adopting a course and resorting to sources
and means at least as appropriate as any afforded under our legal system, to
ascertain and abide by the law, and where he acted in good faith reliance upon
the results of such effort"" (p. 497).  The Court stated (at p. 498):

 

It
is difficult to conceive what more could be reasonably expected of a
""model citizen"" than that he guide his conduct by ""the law""
ascertained in good faith, not merely by efforts which might seem adequate to a
person in his situation, but by efforts as well designed to accomplish
ascertainment as any available under our system.  We are not impressed with the
suggestion that a mistake under such circumstances should aid the defendant
only in inducing more lenient punishment by a court, or executive clemency
after conviction.  The circumstances seem so directly related to the
defendant's behavior upon which the criminal charge is based as to constitute
an integral part of that behavior, for purposes of evaluating it.  No excuse
appears for dealing with it piecemeal.  We think such circumstances should
entitle a defendant to full exoneration as a matter of right, rather than to
something less, as a matter of grace.

 

While the American jurisprudence
has since backed away from accepting reliance on the advice of a lawyer as a
form of officially induced error of law, the defence is well established in American
law in cases where government officials are relied upon.  Long v. State
itself has influenced the Canadian jurists who have opened the way for the
establishment of this defence here.  Discussing the present state of the
defence in American law, W. R. LaFave and A. W. Scott state:

 

Consistent
with the above [reasonable reliance on lower court decisions], the better view
is that if a defendant reasonably relies upon an erroneous official statement
of the law contained in an administrative order or grant or in an official
interpretation by the public officer or body responsible for interpretation,
administration, or enforcement of the law defining the offense, then his belief
that the conduct was not criminal is a defense.

 

(Substantive
Criminal Law (1986), vol. 1, at pp. 592-93, and see generally pp. 589-96.)

 

13    The first Canadian decision to reflect the defence was in R. v. Maclean
(1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 84 (N.S. Co. Ct.), where O Hearn Co. Ct. J. sought to
develop the realm of common law defences available in Canada by relying on Long
v. State.  Maclean's driver's licence had been revoked after he was
convicted of refusing to take a breathalyser test.  He worked at the Halifax
airport and had obtained the permission of his supervisor to drive on airport
property without his licence.  His supervisor's advice was based on Maclean's
telephone call to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles who had advised him that
driving on federal government property, with his boss's permission, was fine. 
O Hearn Co. Ct. J. confined his reasons to the field of delegated legislation. 
He was clearly influenced by the accused's conscientious effort to ascertain
his legal position and by the fact that in inquiring about his legal status he
""went to the source that people ordinarily use to secure information about
drivers' licences and the requirements of licensing and in that sense the
source was appropriate"" (p. 107).

 

14    The defence was again considered in R. v. Potter (1978), 3 C.R. (3d) 154
(P.E.I.S.C.), where the accused was charged with keeping a gambling device
despite the fact that the persons importing the goods to Canada had
specifically inquired to customs officials about their legality and customs
officials had inspected the shipments and collected duty over a period of
years.  McQuaid J. considered and praised the decision in Maclean, but
decided that based on the jurisprudence of this Court he could not follow the
path struck by O Hearn Co. Ct. J.  Instead, he ordered an absolute discharge.

 

15    O Hearn Co. Ct. J. had the opportunity to elaborate his reasoning in R. v.
Flemming (1980), 43 N.S.R. (2d) 249, where he upheld an acquittal on a
driving while disqualified charge.  Flemming's driver's licence was under
suspension and he had consulted the Motor Vehicle Bureau about whether he was
permitted to steer and brake a car which was being towed.  In a thoroughly
reasoned judgment, O Hearn Co. Ct. J. found that this Court's decision in Molis,
supra, about which I have more to say below,  barred a defence of
insufficient promulgation but not a defence of officially induced error.  On
the basis of Molis, however, he rejected his earlier distinction between
statutory and regulatory offences.  Considering s. 19 of the Criminal Code ,
O Hearn Co. Ct. J. stated (at p. 272):

 

If
a person does his best to conform his conduct [to] the law but is misled by
officials charged with the administration of the law, he is not doing anything
at odds with the purpose of the maxim ""Ignorance of the law is not an
excuse"" in its application to criminal law.  The mischief that the policy
is aimed at has not occurred.

 

He specifies that the official
whose advice is followed must be involved in the administration of the law in
question so that following his advice is reasonable, and that the opinion
itself should be reasonable in the circumstances.  In his conclusion on this
issue he states, and I fully agree (at p. 274):

 

Moreover,
most people would consider it radically unjust for the same government to
prosecute an individual for an offence that it had already assured him was not
an offence, through one of its bureaus.

 

Such prosecution, I would assert,
may bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

 

16    The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal recognized an officially induced error of law as a
defence in R. v. MacDougall (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 137.  MacDougall's
licence had been cancelled following a criminal conviction.  He received an
""order of revocation"" and when he commenced appeal proceedings,
received a ""notice of reinstatement"".  After he was informed by his
lawyer that his appeal had been dismissed, he continued driving until receiving
a second ""order of revocation"".  In that interim, he was charged with
driving without a licence.  Macdonald J.A. for the majority stated (at p. 158):

 

          Assuming
. . . that the error of the respondent as to revocation was one of law I am
prepared to say that the facts as found by the trial Judge give rise to a
defence of justification based upon reliance by the respondent on a previous
course of conduct on the part of the Registrar.  This defence might be
classified as officially induced error or perhaps as a form of colour of right.


 

Upholding the trial court's
acquittal, he concluded (at p. 160):

 

          The
defence of officially induced error has not been sanctioned, to my knowledge,
by any appellate Court in this country.  The law, however, is ever-changing and
ideally adapts to meet the changing mores and needs of society.  In this day of
intense involvement in a complex society by all levels of Government with a
corresponding reliance by people on officials of such Government, there is, in
my opinion, a place and need for the defence of officially induced error, at
least so long as mistake of law, regardless of how reasonable, cannot be raised
as a defence to a criminal charge. 

 

17    This Court reversed this decision on other grounds, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 605.  However,
in his judgment for the unanimous Court, Ritchie J. wrote (at p. 613):

 

          It
is not difficult to envisage a situation in which an offence could be committed
under mistake of law arising because of, and therefore induced by,
""officially induced error"", and if there was evidence in the present
case to support such a situation existing it might well be an appropriate
vehicle for applying the reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice Macdonald. In the
present case, however, there is no evidence that the accused was misled by an
error on the part of the Registrar.

 

Clearly, this Court has not
foreclosed the possibility of raising officially induced error of law as a
defence or excuse.  Significantly, the MacDougall decision also affirmed
the validity of the s. 19, ignorance of the law does not excuse, provision. 
Accordingly, the excuse and the traditional rule are not viewed as
contradictory.

 

18    The defence of officially induced error of law was accepted by Ferris Prov. Ct. J.
in R. v. Ross, [1985] Sask. D. 5845-02. Ross did not have an appropriate
licence to drive the truck he had been driving for several years.  He had
inquired about this at the Highway Traffic Board on several occasions as he was
concerned about his insurance.  On each occasion he was assured that he was
appropriately licensed.  He also stopped at weigh scales dozens of times per
year and had his licence inspected.  Ferris Prov. Ct. J. held that this
constituted an excuse to a charge of obstruction of justice when he continued
to drive after police officers told him not to because he did not have a proper
licence.

 

19    In 1986, the Ontario Court of Appeal acknowledged the defence in the context of
regulatory offences in R. v. Cancoil Thermal Corp. (1986), 27 C.C.C.
(3d) 295.  Cancoil was charged under the Occupational Health and Safety Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 321, after removing a protective shield from a piece of machinery. 
A Ministry of Labour inspector had approved operation of the machine without
the shield, but an employee subsequently suffered a serious injury which the
shield would have prevented.  The court overturned the original acquittal on
the basis of another error, but stated (at p. 303) that the defence of
officially induced error should be available at the new trial:

 

          The
defence of ""officially induced error"" is available as a defence to an
alleged violation of a regulatory statute where an accused has reasonably
relied upon the erroneous legal opinion or advice of an official who is
responsible for the administration or enforcement of the particular law.  In
order for the accused to successfully raise this defence, he must show that he
relied on the erroneous legal opinion of the official and that his reliance was
reasonable.  The reasonableness will depend upon several factors including the
efforts he made to ascertain the proper law, the complexity or obscurity of the
law, the position of the official who gave the advice, and the clarity,
definitiveness and reasonableness of the advice given. 

 

The court distinguished this
defence from the defence of due diligence, which would also be available to
Cancoil.

 

20    In R. v. Provincial Foods Inc. (1992), 111 N.S.R. (2d) 420, Palmeter C.J.
Co. Ct. accepted the defence of officially induced error of law when a
vegetable seller relied on the advice of an applications clerk in the Building
Inspection Division of the City of Halifax that no permit was required to run
his business in a particular building.  The defence was also successful in R.
v. Dubeau (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 54 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)). Dubeau was
acquitted of a charge of carrying on the business of firearms and ammunition
sale without a permit after selling approximately 30 guns at a series of garage
sales.  Ferguson J., relying on Cancoil Thermal, supra,
considered that the accused had asked the local firearms officer specifically
about permits for garage sales, and had written a letter on the advice of that
officer to the head office in Toronto.  These actions, in combination with the
complexity of the law, led to an acquittal. 

 

21    Recently, in R. v. Erotica Video Exchange Ltd. (1994), 163 A.R. 181, James
Prov. Ct. J. held that two of three corporate accused charged under the same
provision as the accused in this case, had made out a ""lawful
justification or excuse"" because of their reliance on the approval of the
obscene videos they had retailed by the British Columbia Film Board.  James
Prov. Ct. J. considered detailed evidence of the organization, mandate and
functioning of the British Columbia Film Board before coming to this
conclusion.  A third accused, who had relied upon approval by Quebec's Régie du
cinéma, was not excused, on the basis that there was not sufficient evidence
about that body.  It is unnecessary in this case to consider the role of
approval by film boards in provinces other than that where business was carried
out and criminal charges were laid.  

 

22    Both Stuart and Kastner have interpreted this Court's decision in Molis, supra,
as foreclosing the opportunity for developing an officially induced error of
law defence.  In light of these interpretations, I will clarify the extent of
the decision in Molis.  In that case, writing for a unanimous Court, I
asserted that no defence of ignorance of a regulation exists (at p. 361) and I
concluded (at p. 364):

 

.
. . the defence of due diligence that was referred to in Sault Ste. Marie
is that of due diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a duty imposed by law
and not in relation to the ascertainment of the existence of a prohibition or
its interpretation. 

 

As the Ontario Court of Appeal in
Cancoil Thermal noted, the defence of due diligence is separate from
officially induced error.  While due diligence in ascertaining the law does not
excuse, reasonable reliance on official advice which is erroneous will excuse
an accused but will not, in my view, negative culpability.  There are two
important distinctions between these related provisions.  First, due diligence,
in appropriate circumstances, is a full defence.  If successfully raised, the
elements of the offence are not completed.  Officially induced error, on the
other hand, does not negative culpability.  Rather it functions like
entrapment, as an excuse for an accused whom the Crown has proven to have
committed an offence.  Second, diligence may be necessary to obtain the advice
which grounds an officially induced error.  This is so because an accused who
seeks to rely on this excuse must have weighed the potential illegality of her
actions and made reasonable inquiries.  This standard, however, does not
convert officially induced error into due diligence.  In R. v. Forster,
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 339, I contrasted these two exculpatory provisions (at p. 346):

 

          It
is a principle of our criminal law that an honest but mistaken belief in
respect of the legal consequences of one's deliberate actions does not furnish
a defence to a criminal charge, even when the mistake cannot be attributed to
the negligence of the accused: Molis v. The Queen [cite omitted].  This
Court recently reaffirmed in R. v. Docherty, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941, at p.
960, the principle that knowledge that one's actions are contrary to the law is
not a component of the mens rea for an offence, and consequently does
not operate as a defence.

 

          I
do not rule out the possibility that, in an appropriate case, an officially
induced error as to the state of the law might constitute a defence.  However,
I do not consider that it would be appropriate to rule on this question in the
context of this appeal. 

 

Forster again shows, as
was established in MacDougall, that this Court has opened the door for
an officially induced error excuse while at the same time upholding the Molis
rule.

 

23    Most recently, the existence of an officially induced error defence was recognized
in obiter dictum by Gonthier J. in his dissenting reasons in R. v. Pontes,
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 44.  While I disagreed with Gonthier J. on the principal issue
in that case, I agree with his characterization of this defence (at p. 88):

 

Assuming
without deciding that such a defence would be available if an accused were
misled by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles or by some other official
responsible for the administration of the Motor Vehicle Act, such a
defence would not demonstrate absence of negligence in relation to the actus
reus of driving while under a statutory prohibition, but rather would be an
additional defence thereto, operating as an exception to the rule that
ignorance of the law does not excuse. 

 

Here again, the contrast between
officially induced error of law and the defence of due diligence is clearly
outlined.

 

24    Several themes run through the Canadian jurisprudence to date on this defence and
raise issues which must be determined to outline the scope of the defence. 
Most of the cases to date have dealt with regulatory offences only, raising the
question of when this defence is applicable.  A second group of questions
revolves around who is an official and what constitutes ""official
advice"".  Finally, officially induced error has sometimes functioned as a
full defence, a development which should be discouraged.  I turn next to these
issues.

 

C. Officially Induced Error of
Law

 

25    Officially induced error of law exists as an exception to the rule that ignorance
of the law does not excuse.  As several of the cases where this rule has been
discussed note, the complexity of contemporary regulation makes the assumption
that a responsible citizen will have a comprehensive knowledge of the law
unreasonable.  This complexity, however, does not justify rejecting a rule
which encourages a responsible citizenry, encourages government to publicize
enactments, and is an essential foundation to the rule of law.  Rather,
extensive regulation is one motive for creating a limited exception to the rule
that ignorantia juris neminem excusat.  

 

26    As complexity of regulation is linked to the justification for this excuse, it is predictable
that it will arise most often in the realm of regulatory offences. 
Nonetheless, this excuse is equally valid for ""true crimes"" with a
full mens rea component.  As the involvement of the state in our day to
day lives expands, and the number of officials from whom advice can potentially
be sought increases, the chance that an official may give advice about an
enactment which would not be classified as ""regulatory"" multiplies. 
Officially induced error is distinct from a defence of due diligence, and there
is no reason to confine it to the regulatory offence context, though it is
obvious that for certain crimes, such as those involving moral turpitude, the
chances of success of such an excuse will be nearly nil.

 

27    Furthermore, although the section of the Criminal Code  under which the
appellants here were charged contains the phrase ""without lawful
justification or excuse"", there is no particular link between those words
and officially induced error of law.  Where an accused can raise this argument
on the evidence presented, the trial judge must assess whether the excuse is
made out in law, regardless of the wording of the offence.

 

28    The first step in raising an officially induced error of law argument will be to
determine that the error was in fact one of law or of mixed law and fact.  Of
course, if the error is purely one of fact, this argument will be unnecessary. 
Unlike Professor Barton, I do not agree that officially induced error should be
used to eradicate the distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of
law.  This distinction is important for all the reasons that I believe the
principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse must stand firm. 
Distinguishing between mistakes of fact and those of law remains conceptually
important.  Mistakes of law will only be exculpatory in narrowly defined
circumstances.    

 

29    Once it is determined that the error was one of law, the next step is to
demonstrate that the accused considered the legal consequences of her actions. 
By requiring that an accused must have considered whether her conduct might be
illegal and sought advice as a consequence, we ensure that the incentive for a
responsible and informed citizenry is not undermined. It is insufficient for an
accused who wishes to benefit from this excuse to simply have assumed that her
conduct was permissible.  

 

30    The next step in arguing for this excuse will be to demonstrate that the advice
obtained came from an appropriate official.  One primary objective of this
doctrine is to prevent the obvious injustice which O Hearn Co. Ct. J. noted --
the state approving conduct with one hand and seeking to bring criminal
sanction for that conduct with the other.  In general, therefore, government
officials who are involved in the administration of the law in question will be
considered appropriate officials.  I do not wish to establish a closed list of
officials whose erroneous advice may be considered exculpatory.  The measure
proposed by O Hearn Co. Ct. J. is persuasive.  That is, the official must
be one whom a reasonable individual in the position of the accused would
normally consider responsible for advice about the particular law in question. 
Therefore, the Motor Vehicle Registrar will be an appropriate person to give
advice about driving offences, both federal and provincial.  The determination
of whether the official was an appropriate one to seek advice from is to be
determined in the circumstances of each case. 

 

31    My colleague Sopinka J. argues that, in this case, allowing OFRB approval to
constitute an excuse is an impermissible delegation of power from one level of
government to another.  In my view, this argument does not bar officially
induced error from constituting an excuse which is considered after culpability
has been proven.  There is no issue of the action of a provincial board
precluding criminal prosecutions.  Indeed, we must recall that it is the
provincial Attorney General who makes the decision to prosecute offences, even
when the offence charged is in the Criminal Code .  The advice of
officials of any level of government may induce an error of law and trigger
this provision provided that a reasonable person would consider that particular
government organ to be responsible for the law in question.  The determination
relies on common sense rather than constitutional permutations.

 

32    Several other types of advice have been considered in the cases dealing with this
excuse, for example advice from private lawyers and reliance on judicial
pronouncements.  As these examples are beyond the scope of this case, I make no
comment at this time on whether these types of advice may provide the basis for
officially induced error of law.

 

33    Once an accused has established that he sought advice from an appropriate
official, he must demonstrate that the advice was reasonable in the
circumstances.  In most instances, this criterion will not be difficult to
meet.  As an individual relying on advice has less knowledge of the law than
the official in question, the individual must not be required to assess
reasonableness at a high threshold.  It is sufficient, therefore, to say that if
an appropriate official is consulted, the advice obtained will be presumed to
be reasonable unless it appears on its face to be utterly unreasonable.  

 

34    The advice obtained must also have been erroneous.  This fact, however, does not
need to be demonstrated by the accused.  In proving the elements of the
offence, the Crown will have already established what the correct law is, from
which the existence of error can be deduced.  Nonetheless, it is important to
note that when no erroneous advice has been given, as in MacDougall, supra,
this excuse cannot operate.

 

35    Finally, to benefit from this excuse, the accused must demonstrate reliance on the
official advice.  This can be shown, for example, by proving that the advice
was obtained before the actions in question were commenced and by showing that
the questions posed to the official were specifically tailored to the accused's
situation.

 

36    In summary, officially induced error of law functions as an excuse rather than a
full defence.  It can only be raised after the Crown has proven all elements of
the offence.  In order for an accused to rely on this excuse, she must show,
after establishing she made an error of law, that she considered her legal
position, consulted an appropriate official, obtained reasonable advice and
relied on that advice in her actions.  Accordingly, none of the four
justifications for the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse which
Stuart outlined is undermined by this defence.  There is no evidentiary
problem.  The accused, who is the only one capable of bringing this evidence,
is solely responsible for it.  Ignorance of the law is not encouraged because
informing oneself about the law is a necessary element of the excuse.  Each
person is not a law unto himself because this excuse does not affect
culpability.  Ignorance of the law remains blameworthy in and of itself.  In
these specific instances, however, the blame is, in a sense, shared with the
state official who gave the erroneous advice.

 

D. Procedural Considerations

 

37    As this excuse does not affect a determination of culpability, it is procedurally
similar to entrapment.  Both function as excuses rather than justifications in
that they concede the wrongfulness of the action but assert that under the
circumstances it should not be attributed to the actor. (See R. v. Mack,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at pp. 944-45.)  As in the case of entrapment, the accused
has done nothing to entitle him to an acquittal, but the state has done
something which disentitles it to a conviction (Mack, at p. 975).  Like
entrapment, the successful application of an officially induced error of law
argument will lead to a judicial stay of proceedings rather than an acquittal. 
Consequently, as a stay can only be entered in the clearest of cases, an officially
induced error of law argument will only be successful in the clearest of cases.


 

38    The question of whether officially induced error constitutes an excuse in law is a
question of law or of mixed law and fact.  While a jury may determine whether
the accused is culpable, and hence whether this argument is necessary, it is
for a judge to determine whether the precise conditions for this legal excuse
are made out.  Only the trial judge is in a position to determine if a stay should
be entered.  The elements of the officially induced error excuse are to be
proven on a balance of probabilities by the accused.  

 

III. Application to This Case

 

39    I agree with Sopinka J. regarding the mens rea issue and, hence, the
disposition of this appeal.  Accordingly, nothing turns on the application of
an officially induced error of law analysis in this case.  Nonetheless, as I
believe this excuse would be effective in this case had the Crown proven mens
rea, considering this application is instructive.

 

40    If the appellants had been proven to have the requisite mens rea for an
offence under s. 163(2)  of the Criminal Code , the argument put forward
here would have been an argument based on error of law.  That is, the error
would have been in concluding that the films they retailed were not legally
obscene.  The appellants were aware that they were involved in a business which
risked infringing the Criminal Code , accordingly they were careful to
retail only videos which had been approved by the OFRB.  As the films in
question were ""close to the line"", that is, Newton Prov. Div. J.
determined them to infringe the s. 163(8)  definition of obscenity only after
careful analysis and only on the basis of a few scenes, the opinion of the OFRB
would seem reasonable even to a knowledgeable retailer who had watched every
minute of the films.  It is also significant that those seeking OFRB approval
and classification for films must pay the OFRB per minute of film.  As the
appellants sought, and paid for, the OFRB opinion of these particular films
before putting them on their shelves, the question of reliance on the advice is
proven.

 

41    The difficult issue in this case is whether the OFRB is an appropriate official
body to consult when seeking a determination about whether certain films are
legally obscene, that is, whether they infringe community standards of
tolerance.  The Theatres Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.6, states that:

 

3.-- . . .

          (7)The Board has power, 

 

(a)subject to the regulations, to approve, prohibit and regulate the
exhibition and distribution of film in Ontario; 

 

          33.--
(1) Before the exhibition or distribution in Ontario of a film, an application
for approval to exhibit or distribute and for classification of the film shall
be made to the Board.

 

          (2) After
viewing a film, the Board, in accordance with the criteria prescribed by the
regulations, may refuse to approve the film for exhibition or distribution in
Ontario.

 

Thus the OFRB is charged with
determining which films may be shown in Ontario and with classifying those
films.  The Act also provides for an appeal of the Board's decision first to a
differently constituted panel of the Board and then to the Divisional Court.  Appeals
may be on questions of law, of fact, or of both (s. 33(5), (6), (7), (8)
and (9)).  While clearly the OFRB is not legally responsible for deciding
whether a film infringes the Criminal Code  provisions, it could
presumably itself attract criminal responsibility for approving for
distribution a criminally obscene film.  

 

42    Most importantly, in my view, the OFRB is understood by the general public as the
body which approves films for play in Ontario.  When a film is rejected as
obscene by the OFRB, the headlines proclaim the film's obscenity.  When someone
refers to the ""censor board"", the OFRB is the board Ontarians think
of.  There is no other public body which would be the logical choice for
someone to consult if seeking advice about whether a film can be legally
retailed in Ontario.  In these circumstances, therefore, I would conclude that
had appellants had the requisite mens rea for this offence, they would
be entitled to a judicial stay of proceedings as a result of officially induced
error of law.

 

IV. Disposition

 

43    I would allow the appeal and enter an acquittal.

Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major
JJ. was delivered by

I.  Issue

 

44    This appeal concerns the interpretation of s. 163(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which deals with ""knowingly"" selling
obscene material ""without lawful justification or excuse"".  Does
s. 163(2)(a) of the Code require that the retailer have
knowledge of the specific acts which make the material obscene in law or, is it
sufficient to show that this retailer had a general knowledge that the material
deals with the exploitation of sex?     

          

45    A second issue in this case concerns the effect of provincial film board approval
of the obscene material.  Does such approval preclude conviction either because
it effectively negates the mens rea for the offence or because it
provides legal justification or excuse?

 

II.  Factual Background

 

46    The appellant, Randy Jorgensen, is the sole officer of 913719 Ontario Limited
which owns and operates a store in Scarborough under the name of ""Adults
Only Video and Magazine"".  Acting in an undercover capacity, members of
the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force and the Pornography and Hate Literature
Section purchased eight videotapes from the appellant's store.  Despite the
fact that the Ontario Film Review Board (""OFRB"") had approved the
videotapes, members of the Pornography and Hate Literature Section viewed the
videotapes and concluded that they were obscene.  The appellants were charged
with eight counts of selling obscene material without lawful justification or
excuse contrary to s. 163(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .  

 

III.  Relevant Statutory
Provisions

 

47    Section 163  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , provides:

 

             163.  (1)
Every one commits an offence who

 

(a)  makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has
in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation
any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing
whatever;

 

.
. . 

 

          (2)  Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without
lawful justification or excuse,

 

(a)  sells, exposes to public view or
has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter,
picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever;

 

                                .
. .

 

          (6)  Where an accused is charged with an offence under
subsection (1), the fact that the accused was ignorant of the nature or
presence of the matter, picture, model, phonograph record, crime comic or other
thing by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a
defence to the charge.  [Repealed S.C. 1993, c. 46, s. 1.]

 

                                .
. .

 

          (8)  For the purposes of this Act, any publication a
dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex
and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty
and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.  [Emphasis added.]

 

IV.  Judgments

 

Ontario Court,
Provincial Division

 

48    At
trial, Newton Prov. Div. J. found three of the eight videos (Bung Ho Babes,
Made in Hollywood and Dr. Butts) to be obscene contrary to
s. 163(8)  of the Criminal Code .  Newton Prov. Div. J. found
these videos to be in violation of the Code due to their portrayal of
sex coupled with violence.  

 

49    With
respect to the mens rea of the offence under s. 163(2)  for
""knowingly"" selling these obscene materials, Newton Prov. Div. J.
reviewed the jurisprudence and then outlined the following propositions:

 

1.Censor Board or Customs Department approval is
not a bar to prosecution.  It is the function of the court to determine whether
the material at issue is obscene.

 

2.One cannot escape accountability for criminal
acts by stating that he was led to believe his acts were not criminal.

 

3. The authorities establish a distinction between
retailer and wholesaler.  This distinction between the offences established by
s. 163(1)  and 163(2)  remains important in the post-Charter interpretation.

 

4. It is not incumbent on the Crown, even on a
charge under s. 163(2)  where the Crown must prove that the accused knowingly
committed the offence to prove that an accused, who is aware of the presence
and nature of the subject matter also knew it was obscene in the legal
sense.

 

5. The Crown must prove only that the accused had knowledge
that the dominant characteristic of the material was the exploitation of sex,
not knowledge that the exploitation of sex was undue.

 

6. A mistake of fact which negatives the mental
element which is part of the definition of the offence negatives the offence.  

 

7. The accused's honest and mistaken belief that
the exploitation of sex was not undue or did not exceed the community standards
of tolerance does not fall within the defences of mistake of fact or due
diligence.

 

8. Knowledge can be inferred from the
surrounding circumstances.  [Emphasis added.] 

 

50    With
respect to the mens rea for an offence under s. 163(2) ,
Newton Prov. Div. J. ultimately concluded that:

 

          I am of the view that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused is aware of the presence or nature of the matter that
constitutes the subject of the charge in a general sense. It is not necessary
that the Crown prove the accused was aware of the specific factual contents of
the forbidden material at issue.

 

51    In
elaborating on how knowledge can be inferred from the surrounding
circumstances, Newton Prov. Div. J. explained:

 

          I am of the view that implicit, in the historical analysis of
the statutory scheme and the factual foundation provided in the authorities
that I have referred to is the necessity of a blameworthy state of mind with
respect to the offence in Section 163(2)  of the Criminal Code .

 

          My review of the authorities and principles of criminal law
indicate that the requirement can be satisfied by evidence such as statements
made by an accused person, warnings by police officers with respect to the
content of the materials and continued dissemination of those materials in the
face of the warning, non-compliance with in rem proceedings, non-compliance
with judicial determinations, outstanding charges, condition of the material
and location at the time of seizure, the nature of the material itself,
evidence of some form of clandestine activity, and non-compliance with
requirements with respect to excising portions of a film to meet appropriate
approval standards.

 

52    With
respect to whether reliance on OFRB approval negates any possibility that an
accused acted knowingly, Newton Prov. Div. J. decided that it is the
function of the court to determine whether the material at issue is obscene and
therefore, censor board or customs approval is not a bar to prosecution.  She
emphasized the principle that one cannot escape accountability for criminal
acts by stating that he was led to believe that his acts were not criminal.

          

53    In
arriving at this conclusion, Newton Prov. Div. J. first acknowledged that the
appellant, Jorgensen, had stated that he had relied on the film board approval:

 

          It was further agreed that the accused relied on the Ontario
Film Review Board approval with respect to all of the video tapes which form
the subject of these charges.  Mr. Jorgensen advised the officers that he
purchased only video tapes passed by the Ontario Film Review Board.  

 

54    After
establishing the fact that the appellants had relied on Board approval,
Newton Prov. Div. J. outlined the composition, mandate and
standards of the Board.  Referring to the testimony of Mr. Payne, Chairman of
the OFRB, Newton Prov. Div. J. summarized as follows:

 

          The Board is comprised of men and women from various
educational, geographical, religious, racial and cultural backgrounds
throughout Ontario in an attempt to reflect the diversity of the population. .
. .  He testified that the Ontario Board is more conservative than other
Canadian Boards, with respect to sexual content issues.

 

          He indicated that Canadian community standards of tolerance
are determinative of approval for distribution. . . .  

 

. . . He confirmed that while the Board serves the population of
Ontario, it applies a National standard of tolerance.  He recognized that it
is the function of the courts to determine obscenity, but maintained that the
Board would not knowingly approve material that was obscene.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

55    Following
the principles outlined above, Newton Prov. Div. J. concluded that film board
approval was not a bar to prosecution and that it was the function of the court
ultimately to determine whether the material was obscene in law.

          

56    As
for the final issue of whether OFRB approval constitutes a lawful justification
or excuse, Newton Prov. Div. J. concluded that such approval did not provide a
complete defence.  She concluded:

 

          While I appreciate that there is evidence before me that in
exercising their mandate, the Board considers factors relevant to the s. 163(8) 
determination, I am of the view that the Ontario Film Review Board approval is
not a justification or excuse, as it is the function of the Court to determine
whether the material is obscene within Section 163(8)  of the Criminal Code . 
Their approval, though lawful, would not make the conduct lawful if it was
proven to the requisite degree that the video tape was obscene within the
parameters of the legislation.  

 

57    Newton
Prov. Div. J. did acknowledge, however, that Board approval would be relevant
in the court's determination of whether the materials were obscene in law. 
Again referring to the evidence of Mr. Payne, Newton Prov. Div. J.
noted:

 

          Based on the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination
before me, I am satisfied that his evidence is such that I cannot reject it as
being indicative of community standards of tolerance.  While I am mindful that
he did not view any of the videos before me, and while some of his evidence
would negate current Board approval, I am satisfied that it is a matter of
weight to be attached to his evidence.  

 

Ontario Court of
Appeal (Robins J.A., Doherty and
Austin JJ.A. concurring)

 

58    The
Court of Appeal unanimously decided that the Crown need only show that the
retailer of the obscene materials was ""aware of the videos and the nature
of their subject matter"".  The court rejected the argument that the OFRB
approval negated the possibility of finding that the appellants acted knowingly
in selling obscene films.  The court held that OFRB approval was irrelevant to
the question of mens rea, although it may be a relevant factor in the
mitigation of sentence.  Robins J.A. held:

 

In my opinion, the Board's decision that the films did not exceed the
community's standard of tolerance and should therefore be approved for
restricted viewing is irrelevant to the question of whether the appellants can
be fixed with sufficient knowledge of their contents to be found to have
`knowingly' sold obscene films.  The Crown is not required to prove that
they had specific knowledge of those parts of the film which were determinative
in the trial judge's assessment of whether they were obscene.  The appellants
were aware of the videos and the nature of their subject matter.  The fact
that they may not have known that the films were obscene in the legal sense, or
that the board's approval may have led them to believe that the films were not
obscene, may be mitigating factors on the question of sentence, but are
immaterial to the issue of whether the appellants acted `knowingly'.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

59    The
court also affirmed the trial judge's decision that the OFRB approval of the
videos does not amount to a lawful justification or excuse.  The court noted
that the approval of certain material by a body charged with considering
whether the material is suitable for purposes other than the criminal law
cannot constitute lawful justification or excuse within the meaning of
s. 163(2) (a).  The court regarded it as untenable that a provincial
board would be able to determine the criminal issue of whether material is
obscene.

          

60    Despite
the fact that Board approval cannot be determinative, Robins J.A. also
acknowledged its relevance.  He wrote:

 

While the Board's approval of video films depicting explicit sexual
activity between consenting adults without violence, bestiality, necrophilia
and the like clearly cannot be determinative of the criminal law of obscenity,
or preclude a court from ruling otherwise, it is plainly relevant to the
question of community standards of tolerance. . . .

 

61    The
Court of Appeal ultimately decided that weighing all the factors in issue, the
trial judge's decision was supported by the evidence and that she made no error
of law.  Robins J.A. concluded:

 

As I have already stated, the Board's approval of the films may be
evidence of what the contemporary community will tolerate.  However, the
Board's approval is not binding on a court or determinative of whether the
films are criminally obscene.  The trial judge properly treated this evidence
as indicative of community standards of tolerance, and fully recognized that
due weight must be given to it.  Nonetheless, for reasons she carefully
explained, she was not persuaded that it raised a reasonable doubt as to the
appellants' guilt.  Her review of the films led her to conclude that their
contents, which are outlined above, included the portrayal of sex coupled with
violence and coercion or subordination and created the requisite risk of harm. 
She accordingly found that the films unduly exploited sex and were obscene
within the Butler test.  The trial judge was entitled to reach this
conclusion on the evidence before her and made no error in law in so doing. 

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Knowingly

 

62    The
central issue in this appeal is the nature of the mens rea requirement
in s. 163(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  when it states that it
must be shown that the accused acted ""knowingly"" in selling obscene
material.  Is an accused acting knowingly when he or she is aware only of the
general nature or the subject matter of the work in question?  The Crown
responds in the affirmative and submits that it is sufficient that it is
established that the accused was aware that the dominant characteristic is the
exploitation of sex.  On the other hand, the accused appellants contend that
the term ""knowingly"" should extend to all factual elements of the actus
reus.  On the basis of this submission, it must be shown that the accused
was aware of particular content of the material which makes it criminal. 
Material, the dominant characteristic of which is the exploitation of sex,
crosses the line and becomes criminal only when it is shown that the
exploitation of sex is undue.  The appellants contend that the prosecution must
establish knowledge on the part of the accused of the content of the material
which renders the exploitation undue in law.

 

63    To
put the positions of the parties in context it is helpful to observe that,
pursuant to this Court's decision in R. v. Butler, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 452,
material that involves the exploitation of sex which does not involve sex with
violence and is neither degrading nor dehumanizing is generally not obscene.  
Accordingly, the Crown's submission would limit the operation of the word
""knowingly"" to awareness of conduct which is not criminal.  Knowledge
of such conduct would not, therefore, constitute a blameworthy mind state.  I
have concluded that the Crown's submission does not accord with the rules of
statutory construction and is not supported by any policy reason.

 

64    It
is a general rule of statutory construction that when the term
""knowingly"" is used in a criminal statute, it applies to all elements
of the actus reus.  In R. v. Rees, [1956] S.C.R. 640, this Court
considered whether, on a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a child
under the age of 18, honest belief that the child was over the age was a
defence.  The majority held that in accordance with the rule of statutory
construction to which I have referred, the term ""knowingly"" must be
applied to all elements of the offence and in particular to the age of the
child.  Cartwright J., at p. 652, cited with approval a statement from
Glanville Williams:

 

In his book on Criminal Law (1953) at pages 131 and 133, Mr. Glanville
Williams says:__

 

             It is a general rule of construction
of the word ""knowingly"" in a Statute that it applies to all the
elements of the actus reus . . .

 

             The sound principle of construction
is to say that the requirement of knowledge, once introduced into the offence,
governs the whole, unless Parliament has expressly provided to the contrary.

 

In my opinion these passages are supported by the authorities collected
by the learned author at the pages mentioned and correctly state the general
rule.  

 

And at p. 653 he
expressly adopted the following passage from the reasons of the Chief Justice
of British Columbia: 

 

          In my view of the matter we must start out with the
proposition that sexual intercourse with a woman, not under the age of 18 years
and with her consent, is not a crime, except under exceptional and irrelevant
circumstances.  It follows that if the appellant had sexual intercourse with a
girl not under 18 years of age he could not be convicted of contributing to her
becoming a juvenile delinquent for the simple reason she is not a child within
the meaning of the Act.

 

          It is the age factor alone that, in these circumstances, moves
the act from a non-criminal to a criminal category.

 

          It follows, it seems to me, that when a man is charged with
knowingly and wilfully doing an act that is unlawful only if some factor exists
which makes it unlawful (in this instance the age of the girl) he cannot be
convicted unless he knows of, or is wilfully blind to, the existence of that
factor, and then with that knowledge commits the act intentionally and without
any justifiable excuse.  

 

He then continued as
follows:

 

          It would indeed be a startling result if it should be held
that in a case in which Parliament has seen fit to use the word
""knowingly"" in describing an offence honest ignorance on the part of
the accused of the one fact which alone renders the action criminal affords no
answer to the charge.  

 

65    All
the judges in the majority agreed with this application of the rule of
statutory construction.  Fauteux J. dissented.

 

66    I
find nothing in the language of the section to suggest that the word
""knowingly"" should be given a restricted meaning.  Moreover, an
examination of the history of these provisions and an analysis of policy
considerations tend to support the position of the appellants.

 

67    In
reviewing the history and purpose of s. 163  it is useful to note the
distinction that the Code makes between those who produce or
distribute obscene materials and those who sell or retail such
materials.

 

68    Section
163(1) focuses on the producers and distributors of obscene material:

 

          163.  (1)Every one commits an offence who

 

(a)       makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or
has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or
other thing whatever; or

 

(b)       makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in
his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation a
crime comic.  

 

Section 163(2) , on the
other hand, focuses on those who sell such materials:

 

          (2)  Every one commits an offence who knowingly,
without lawful justification or excuse,

 

(a)       sells, exposes to public view or
has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatever;  [Emphasis added.]

 

69    It
is immediately apparent that in the case of producers and distributors, the actus
reus need not be committed knowingly, whereas in the case of sellers and
retailers it is an essential element. 

 

70    A
most helpful history of these provisions is contained in the reasons of Martin
J.A. in R. v. Metro News Ltd. (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.).  In
that case the accused was charged under s. 163(1)  (then s. 159(1)) with
distributing an obscene publication:  an edition of Penthouse magazine. 
The court found that s. 163(6)  (then s. 159(6)), which barred the defence
of honest mistake of fact to the offence of distributing obscene material under
s. 163(1) , infringed s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  in that it created an absolute liability offence having
imprisonment as a potential punishment.  Martin J.A., for the court, first
noted that the obscenity provision dates back to the Criminal Code  of
1892.  He further observed that the words ""knowingly without lawful
justification or excuse"" had originally qualified both the offences of
""selling"" and ""distributing"" obscene matter.  The Code
was later amended in 1949 and this qualification was altered, such that it no
longer applied to distributing obscene matter.

 

71    Martin
J.A. further noted that the purpose of the 1949 amendment was quite simply to
remove the knowledge requirement for distributing obscene material but
left the requirement intact for selling obscene matter.  As Martin J.A.
observed, at p. 56:  ""Patently, the purpose of the 1949 amendment was to
make the absence of a blameworthy state of mind irrelevant on a charge of
distributing obscene matter.""  

 

72    Martin
J.A., speaking for the court, went on to declare s. 163(6)  invalid by
reason of its inconsistency with s. 7 .  In accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice, however, while the Crown was not required to prove
knowledge on the part of a producer or distributor, the latter was entitled to
be acquitted if there was evidence raising a reasonable doubt that the accused
had an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which, if true, would
render his conduct innocent.  I am generally in agreement with Martin J.A. that
it was Parliament's intention to make a clear distinction between the elements
of the offences created by s. 163(1)  and (2) .  With respect to the former,
Parliament intended to create an absolute liability offence but the principles
of fundamental justice require that it be treated as a strict liability
offence. 

 

73    This
history of the section provides no support for a restricted interpretation of
the term ""knowingly"".  Indeed it supports the view that in order to
comply with Parliament's intention a clear distinction should be maintained
between the subsections.  If subs. (1) is now a strict liability offence,
the logical interpretation which will maintain a clear distinction is to give
the word ""knowingly"" its usual interpretation in accordance with the
rule of statutory construction to which I have referred.  

 

74    In
my view there are sound reasons for such a distinction.  Producers and
distributors can be presumed to be familiar with the content of the material
that they create or distribute.  Furthermore, if the law casts upon them the
obligation of being familiar with the material they make or distribute, that
can easily be discharged.  On the other hand, a seller of pornographic material
may include among her merchandise magazines, books and a myriad of other
products.  Until the materials arrive at the seller's shop, he or she has had
nothing to do with the material.  It might be suggested that the seller can ask
the distributor or producer about content when the material is ordered.  This
is not likely to produce a helpful response.  Anyone in the business of
producing or distributing pornographic material for profit is not likely
inclined to scare off buyers by telling them his or her product can potentially
subject the potential purchaser to criminal liability.  It would, therefore, be
perfectly reasonable for Parliament to have assumed that the seller would
ordinarily not be aware of the specific nature of the contents of the material
sold, in which circumstance imposing criminal liability would result in the
conviction of many persons who did not possess a blameworthy mind state.

 

75    Conversely,
the producer or distributor will generally be aware of the contents of the
material which may result in its being found to be obscene.  The imposition of
criminal liability in the absence of knowledge of the contents will be less
likely to result in the conviction of those that are mentally blameless.  In
addition, a producer or distributor who knows that absence of knowledge in
default of a reasonable inquiry cannot be relied on can easily find out what
the material contains.  On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to expect
the seller to read every book or magazine and view every video or film to
ferret out the portions that may run afoul of the obscenity provisions.

 

76    I
therefore conclude that in using the word ""knowingly"" in
s. 163(2)  Parliament did not intend to restrict its meaning.  In all the
circumstances it would make little sense to conclude that Parliament required
proof of knowledge but limited the requirement to proof of the aspect of the actus
reus that is perfectly lawful.  Although, as a constitutional imperative, a
blameworthy mental element need not extend to all aspects of the actus reus,
Parliament can choose to legislate beyond minimum constitutional limits.  In my
view, in choosing the term ""knowingly"", it has done so in this case.

 

77    Both
parties contended that the case law supported their respective positions.  In
my view the case law, while inconclusive on this point, is not inconsistent
with the position of the appellants.  I now turn to an examination of the
principal cases.

 

78    In
R. v. Cameron, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 273 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to
S.C.C. refused, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 195n, the accused, who managed the affairs of a
commercial art gallery in Toronto, was charged with seven counts of exposing
obscene drawings to public view.  With respect to the interpretation of
""knowingly"", Aylesworth J.A., speaking for the court on this point,
framed the issue in the following manner (at pp. 285-86):

 

Did the appellant do what she did knowingly and without lawful
justification or excuse?  No argument was addressed to us suggesting that there
was any lack of proof that what appellant did, she did knowingly.  Reference
already has been made to the fact that she collected these drawings through
private galleries and from the artists themselves, and that she arranged for
their exposure to public view; she well knew, of course, the subject-matter
of the drawings; she could scarcely assent to and arrange for their exhibition
and grouping in her gallery for sale to the public and at stated prices without
such knowledge.  ""Knowingly"" does not require that appellant should
possess the legal knowledge of whether or not the drawings were obscene; it is
sufficient if she knew the subject-matter and caused the drawings to be
publicly exhibited.  [Emphasis added.]

 

79    The
use of the words ""knowledge of the subject-matter"" are consistent
with a mens rea requirement of subjective knowledge of the factual
content of the drawings which rendered them obscene in law.  Although the court
stated that knowing that the material is obscene in law is clearly not
necessary, Aylesworth J.A. focused on whether the accused was aware of the
subject matter of the drawings. 

          

80    The
issue was also addressed in R. v. Kiverago (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 463
(Ont. C.A.), in which the accused was charged with exposing an obscene poster
to public view.  The central issue was whether an accused's honest belief that
the material is not obscene provides a defence.  The Court of Appeal found that
since having knowledge that the material is obscene in law is not a constituent
element of the offence, an honest belief that the material is not obscene would
not provide a defence.  However, in considering this point of law, the court (per
Gale C.J.O.) cited approvingly the above passage from Cameron, and then
commented (at p. 465):  

 

          In this case, Mr. Kiverago certainly knew the nature of
this poster and caused it to be exposed to public view. . . .

 

. . . s-s. (2) seems to us to suggest that, even assuming the material
is obscene, the person who exposes it cannot be guilty of an offence unless he
knows that he has exposed it and does not have some lawful justification or
excuse for doing so. . . .  [Emphasis added.] 

 

Kiverago thus makes clear that the mens rea for the
offence which was discussed was subjective knowledge of the specific content of
the material. It is true that the nature of the medium allowed the court to
infer knowledge of the specific subject matter.  Like displaying pictures in an
art gallery which was the situation in Cameron, putting up a poster
necessarily requires actual subjective detailed knowledge of the material.  The
nature of the obscene material was openly observable such that merely seeing
the painting or poster made one knowledgeable as to its contents.  Perhaps,
therefore, it was unnecessary for the court to consider a reduced level of
knowledge.

 

81    Films
and videos raise a different problem as they are not as readily observable as
paintings or posters.  The same types of inferences or assumptions about
whether an accused is aware of their contents cannot be made.  This issue was
dealt with in R. v. McFall (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.).  The
accused was charged with having possession of obscene films for the purpose of
exposing them to public view.  The films, which were owned by the accused
corporation, were shown in cubicles in the back of a book store managed by
another accused, with signs reading:  ""Restricted to persons over 18""
and ""Sex __ exciting movies"".  Taggart J.A. reviewed the Cameron
and Kiverago decisions, and then commented (at p. 194): 

 

          Counsel for the Crown submitted that it is not incumbent on
the Crown to show that the accused had seen all or any part of the film in
question in order to prove knowledge but that it is sufficient if the Crown
shows that the accused had knowledge of the nature of the film.  I think that
is a correct position for the Crown to take for I am of the opinion that in R.
v. Cameron, supra, Aylesworth J.A., accurately describes what is
meant by the word ""knowingly"". In saying that, I am not overlooking
the obvious distinction that in that case the Court was considering paintings
whose content must have been known to the accused who had handled and arranged
them whereas here we have a film which would have to be projected to be seen
and which the Crown has not proved was seen by any of the appellants. Notwithstanding
that I think the Crown has satisfied the requirement of s. [163(2)(a)]
if it shows that the accused had knowledge, not that the film was obscene in
the legal sense, but that they had knowledge of its nature, that is that it was
a film of which a dominant characteristic was the exploitation of sex. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

82    Taggart
J.A. quite plainly addresses the distinction between paintings, posters and
films.  Despite the acknowledgment that it could not be said how much of the
contents of the film were known to the appellants, Taggart J.A. decided that it
was only necessary for the Crown to show that the appellants knew that the
film's dominant characteristic was the exploitation of sex.

          

83    If
this were all that was required, the Crown's task would not be very onerous. 
Pornographic films deal with the exploitation of sex.  Their plots are thin or
non-existent and the quality of acting makes awards for acting excellence
rather doubtful.  It can almost be assumed that a retailer of pornography will
be aware of the fact that the materials that he is selling are those where the
dominant characteristic is the exploitation of sex. 

 

84    This
assumption does not, however, appear to have resolved the case for Taggart
J.A.  Taggart J.A. carefully considered the evidence which was available to
support the conclusion that the accused acted ""knowingly"" despite the
fact that he had not seen the film.  He noted at pp. 194-95:

 

          It is next necessary to consider whether the Crown adduced
evidence which the jury could find that the appellants had knowledge of the
nature of the film in question in count 2.  I think there was evidence of that
kind and it included:

 

(a)the signs posted on one of the cubicles;

 

(b)the circumstances under which the film might be
seen by members of the public, including the cubicles;

 

(c)the following facts:  count 2 charges an
offence alleged to have taken place later in time than the offence charged in
count 1.  The films referred to in count 1 had been seized and both Mr.
Candella and Mr. McFall had been warned that charges of possession of obscene
films might be preferred against them in respect of the films referred to in
count 1;

 

(d)the following facts: . . . Mr. McDonald, the
film classification director for British Columbia, was called as a witness for
the defence.  He said the film referred to in count 2 had been received from
the appellant McFall for approval, had been looked at and approved for showing
as ""restricted"" provided about 20 or 30 feet of the film was
excised.  The film was then returned to McFall.  [Emphasis added.]

 

85    The
fact that Taggart J.A. looked for this type of evidence suggests that merely
knowing that the film was a sex film was not sufficient to convict.  In
particular, the previous seizure of the materials and the explicit directions
from the film classification director to delete certain portions of a film
before showing the film, are good indications that the accused was either aware
of or wilfully blind to the contents of the obscene films.  It appears that
Taggart J.A. was looking for some indication that the accused had knowledge of
the fact that the film contained certain elements which could be deemed as obscene
in law.  It appears, therefore, that although the definition of mens rea
by Taggart J.A. would support a lesser level of mens rea, in reviewing
the evidence, he exacted a level of knowledge of the content of the materials
which in law rendered it obscene.

 

86    In
Metro News, to which I have already referred, Martin J.A. considered
whether the mens rea for the offence of distributing obscene matter
required proof of knowledge that the material exceeded community standards of
tolerance.  At page 56 he stated:  

 

          It is, in my view, well established that it is not incumbent
on the Crown, even on a charge under s. [163(2)] where the Crown must prove
that the accused ""knowingly"" committed the offence, to prove that an
accused who is aware of the presence and nature of the subject- matter also
knew that it was obscene.  

 

Martin J.A. continued at
p. 58:

 

          In Hamling v. U.S. (1974), 418 U.S. 87, the defendant
was charged with use of the mails to carry an obscene book in violation of 18
U.S.C.  The Supreme Court of the United States held that the requirement of
""knowingly"" in art. 1461 of 18 U.S.C., making it an offence to
""knowingly"" use the mails for the mailing of non-mailable matter, was
satisfied by proof that the defendant had knowledge of the contents of the
materials he distributed and that he knew the character and nature of the
materials.  [Emphasis added.]

 

87    All
of this suggests that Martin J.A. was convinced that the word
""knowingly"" should be given its plain meaning so as to require actual
subjective knowledge of the nature and character of the material which would
qualify it as obscene.  This, according to Martin J.A., was necessary to
reflect the nature of mens rea in this context (at pp. 54-55):

 

The minimum and necessary mental element required for criminal liability
for most crimes is knowledge of the circumstances which make up the actus
reus of the crime and foresight or intention with respect to any
consequence required to constitute the actus reus of the crime.  Wilful
blindness is equated with actual knowledge. . . .

 

88    Having
reviewed these cases, I would suggest that the jurisprudence supports the
conclusion that for the Crown to convict on a charge of ""knowingly""
selling obscene materials, it must show more than that the accused had a
general knowledge of the nature of the film as a sex film.  Although the cases
have been few and are by no means clear on this point, cases such as McFall
and Metro News illustrate that courts have looked for some indication
that the seller of the obscene material was aware of the relevant facts
that made the material obscene.  In the case of displaying paintings or
posters, it could be inferred that the person selling these paintings or
posters had knowledge of what made them obscene.  The obscene material is
plainly in view and its contents and knowledge of the specific nature of its
contents can be assumed ""known"".  The same cannot be said concerning
films, videos and other media involving a collection of images and where it
takes some time and active steps to observe and ""know"" the contents. 
In the case of pornographic films and videos, it cannot be easily inferred that
those selling these materials ""know"" their contents.  As noted above,
it may be inferred that the retailer is aware that the materials are erotic or
pornographic and deal with the exploitation of sex.  But selling films which
deal with the exploitation of sex is not an illegal activity in itself.  There
must be something in the material that transports it into the realm of
obscenity.  Not only must the dominant characteristic of the material be the
exploitation of sex, but the exploitation of sex must be undue.  

 

89    What
distinguishes mere pornographic material which may constitute an exploitation
of sex from obscene material which constitutes an ""undue exploitation of
sex"" was elaborated in Butler, supra.  In my reasons I
suggest that pornography can usefully be divided into three categories (at
p. 484):

 

(1)  explicit sex with violence;

 

(2)  explicit sex without violence but which subjects people to
treatment that is degrading or dehumanizing; and

 

(3)  explicit sex without violence that is neither degrading nor
dehumanizing.

 

The significance of this
classification was explained at p. 485:

 

          In making this determination with respect to the three
categories of pornography referred to above, the portrayal of sex coupled with
violence will almost always constitute the undue exploitation of sex.  Explicit
sex which is degrading or dehumanizing may be undue if the risk of harm is
substantial.  Finally, explicit sex that is not violent and neither degrading
nor dehumanizing is generally tolerated in our society and will not qualify as
the undue exploitation of sex unless it employs children in its production.  

 

90    Applying
the principles set forth in Butler, Newton Prov. Div. J.
concluded that three of the eight videos taken from Mr. Jorgensen's store
involved the undue exploitation of sex according to s. 163(8) of the Code. 
These films were titled Bung Ho Babes, Made in Hollywood and Dr.
Butts.  The specific characteristics of these videos which led Newton
Prov. Div. J. to conclude that the videos were contrary to the Code
are clearly relevant to determining whether a retailer ""knowingly""
sold obscene materials contrary to s. 163(2) (a).   

 

91    In
Bung Ho Babes the video portrays a female prison warden ordering that
the female inmates disrobe and that one of the inmates spank the other.  The
woman complies in spanking the other inmate and this produces visible reddening
of the woman's buttocks.  Newton Prov. Div. J. held that this video
constituted the undue exploitation of sex due to the manner in which it equated
sex and punishment in the context of subordination.  

 

92    In
Made in Hollywood, one of the scenes shows a male ordering women to
perform various sexual acts.  One of the women appears distressed and the
other, with whom he is having intercourse, is slapped several times on the
buttocks producing visible red marks.  This was also viewed by Newton
Prov. Div. J. as the undue exploitation of sex due to the manner in
which it coupled sex and violence. 

 

93    The
other video, Dr. Butts, includes a scene where a husband and wife are in
their bedroom discussing the wife's current job prospects.  The husband orders
his wife to perform anal sex as a prerequisite to her pursuit of a movie
career.  During anal intercourse, the man slaps the woman's buttocks repeatedly
thereby producing visible red marks.  She appears to be grimacing in pain and
her remarks do not indicate that she is consenting.  Newton
Prov. Div. J. found that this video also involved the undue
exploitation of sex in that the woman is coerced into sexual relations and that
the violence and her position of subordination are legitimized.    

 

94    As
these comments illustrate, it was not merely the fact that the videos in
question dealt with the exploitation of sex that made them offensive and
contrary to s. 163(8) .  It was the fact that the videos combined explicit
sex with violence.  This type of material falls directly within the first
category outlined in Butler.  What Newton Prov. Div. J.'s
comments further suggest by implication, is that other parts of the videos
which did not combine sex and violence did not offend s. 163(8) .  It was
only those scenes that depicted the undue exploitation of sex that were in contravention
of the Code. 

 

95    If
we relate these observations to the application of s. 163(2) (a), it
suggests that merely showing that a retailer knows that the material that he or
she is selling deals generally with the exploitation of sex fails to link the
retailer to the offence of ""knowingly"" selling obscene material.  In
my view, the law requires that in order to make the necessary link it must be
shown that the retailer knew of the specific acts or set of facts which led the
courts to the conclusion that the material in question was obscene under
s. 163(8) .  If, for example, the offensive part of the video was that
which showed a male spanking the female and forcing her to have sexual
relations, then for an accused to be convicted under s. 163(2) (a),
it must be shown that the retailer was aware or wilfully blind that the video
being sold contained this scene.

 

96    There
may of course be cases where the obscenity results from the overall character
of the film.  This may occur, for example, where a video portrays women in
positions of subordination, servile submission or humiliation without any
verbalization or other express reference to this depiction as a theme in
itself.  This type of ubiquitous portrayal may have a cumulative degrading
effect sufficient to render it undue in accordance with the criteria in Butler. 
To be undue, pornography that falls within this category requires the
determination that the degrading or dehumanizing treatment create a substantial
risk of harm.  This risk is assessed by reference to the community standards
test.  The complexity of this assessment can be compared to the relatively
straight-forward first category:  whereas sex with violence is usually readily
identifiable visually, sex with degrading or dehumanizing treatment can be more
abstract or subliminal.  I noted in Butler that in some cases, the very
appearance of consent makes the depicted acts even more degrading or
dehumanizing.  Videos falling within the second category are therefore more
likely than those in the first category to be deemed obscene because of an
overall effect without reference to specific acts or portions of the whole.  In
such instances, if the court is unable to specify any particular scene but still
concludes that, overall, the film is obscene in law, then it only makes sense
that sufficient proof be offered to show that the retailer was aware of the
""overall"" obscene nature of the film.  

 

97    This
is not, of course, to suggest that a retailer must know that the materials
being sold were obscene in law.  If the retailer says he viewed the films and
saw the particular spanking or noticed the underlying degradation but thought
that it was harmless and inoffensive, this will not provide a defence.  The
retailer will not be immune from charges merely because he or she does not know
how the law defines obscenity.  Nor will a retailer be immune from conviction
because he or she is unaware that there are any laws against selling obscene
material.  This would amount to the defence of mistake of law and it is well
established that ignorance of the law is no defence.  What is required is that
the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt the retailer's knowledge that the
materials being sold have the qualities or contain the specific scenes which
render such materials obscene in law.   

 

98    The
Crown expressed some concerns that requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt
that the retailer was aware of the specific facts or nature of the film which
led the court to decide that the material was obscene in law, is impractical
and would effectively make prosecution impossible.  The Crown argues that the
reality of mass-market video retailing is such that it is highly unlikely that
a retailer will have viewed the products on the shelves.  Furthermore, it is
argued that retailers will simply choose not to view their videos thereby
escaping conviction.

 

99    The
Crown also submits that retailers of pornography, having consciously chosen to
enter this regulated and financially profitable field, should be held
responsible for the social harm caused when the pornography that they sell
crosses the line into obscenity.  The Crown suggests that these retailers are
best placed to prevent the harm in the first place by applying greater caution
in the materials that they sell.  Essentially, as the argument goes, a retailer
knows his merchandise may be obscene even if passed by the OFRB, or at the very
least, one can say that he knows that he is engaging in an activity where the
product is possibly subject to criminalization.  By not enquiring for himself
as to the character of the film, the retailer is wilfully blind to the risk
that the product poses.  OFRB approval may significantly reduce, but does not
eliminate, the risk that the material is obscene.  A retailer who has not
viewed the film is thus as morally blameworthy as someone who has viewed the
film, since he knows there is a risk but chooses to sell the film in spite of
this risk. 

 

100   There
are two observations that tend to meet these concerns.  First, proof that a
retailer has knowledge of the specific acts or characteristics that make a
video obscene does not necessarily require proof that the retailer actually
watched the obscene material in question.  ""Knowledge"" of the obscene
character of the film can clearly be acquired by other means than direct
viewing.  On this issue, Newton Prov. Div. J. noted that a
blameworthy state of mind can be shown in a number of ways short of
demonstrating that the film was actually seen.  In her oral reasons she
explains:

 

          My review of the authorities and principles of criminal law
indicate that the [knowledge] requirement can be satisfied by evidence such as
statements made by an accused person, warnings by police officers with respect
to the content of the materials and continued dissemination of those materials
in the face of the warning, non-compliance with in rem proceedings,
non-compliance with judicial determinations, outstanding charges, condition of
the material and location at the time of seizure, the nature of the material
itself, evidence of some form of clandestine activity, and non-compliance with
requirements with respect to excising portions of a film to meet appropriate
approval standards.

 

Accordingly, evidence
which suggests that the retailer was warned of particular materials or failed
to comply with requirements with respect to excising portions of a film, can
indeed be relevant in determining whether a retailer had ""knowledge""
that he was selling obscene materials.  The use of this type of evidence for
this purpose was aptly illustrated by Taggart J.A. in making his determination
in McFall.  

 

101   In
addition, the retailer's knowledge may be determined from other circumstances
directly linked to the context of the retailer's activity.  Both
Taggart J.A. in McFall and Newton Prov. Div. J. refer to
such circumstances, including the location of the activity and signs of
clandestine behaviour.  Where, for example, a retailer dealing only in
pornographic videos keeps a separate selection of high-priced videos, secures
certain videos in a locked cabinet, shields certain videos from plain view, or
maintains a list of videos available on request only, this may constitute a
relevant circumstance.  Such circumstances can easily be distinguished from
those of a corner store that carries the odd porno flick among an otherwise
unremarkable video collection.  Circumstances that are internal to the
retailer's business activity can, therefore, be considered relevant
circumstances for the purpose of determining knowledge, similarly to factors
such as warnings or directions from external sources.

 

B.  Wilful Blindness

 

102   The
second response to the concerns expressed by the Crown relates to the
principles of wilful blindness.  It is well established in criminal law that
wilful blindness will also fulfil a mens rea requirement.  If the
retailer becomes aware of the need to make further inquiries about the nature
of the videos he was selling yet deliberately chooses to ignore these
indications and does not make any further inquiries, then the retailer can be
nonetheless charged under s. 163(2) (a) for ""knowingly""
selling obscene materials.  Deliberately choosing not to know something when
given reason to believe further inquiry is necessary can satisfy the mental
element of the offence.  As Glanville Williams wrote in Criminal Law: The
General Part (2nd ed. 1961), at pp. 157-58:

 

[T]he rule is that if a party has his suspicion aroused but then
deliberately omits to make further enquiries, because he wishes to remain in
ignorance, he is deemed to have knowledge. . . .  

 

. . . In other words, there is a suspicion which the defendant
deliberately omits to turn into certain knowledge. This is frequently expressed
by saying that he ""shut his eyes"" to the fact, or that he was
""wilfully blind"".  

 

And, at pp. 158-59, the
learned author states:

 

          Before the doctrine of wilful blindness applies, there must be
realisation that the fact in question is probable, or, at least, ""possible
above the average"". . . .

 

. . . A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost
be said that the defendant actually knew.  He suspected the fact; he realised
its probability; but he refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because
he wanted in the event to be able to deny knowledge.  This, and this alone, is
wilful blindness.  

 

103   A
finding of wilful blindness involves an affirmative answer to the question: 
Did the accused shut his eyes because he knew or strongly suspected that
looking would fix him with knowledge?  Retailers who suspect that the materials
are obscene but refrain from making the necessary inquiry in order to avoid
being contaminated by knowledge may be found to have been wilfully blind.  The
determination must be made in light of all the circumstances.  In Sansregret
v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, this Court held that the circumstances
were not restricted to those immediately surrounding the particular offense but
could be more broadly defined to encompass, for example, past events.  See also
R. v. Blondin (1970), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 118 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 122.  It would
seem, therefore, that a relevant circumstance would include assurances from
others who are presumed to know and in particular public officials such as the
OFRB.  

 

104   The
appellants offer a further answer to the concerns expressed by the Crown.  They
submit that any difficulty in proving knowledge against the seller will have
the salutary effect of concentrating enforcement against the distributor who is
better placed to screen out obscene matter.  While this submission is
appealing, it is not this Court's function to dictate enforcement policy. 
Nonetheless, Parliament chose to set an onerous standard of proof by adopting
the word ""knowingly"".  If its choice of language renders enforcement
difficult as against the seller and it is considered desirable to make
enforcement more effective, there is no reason why Parliament cannot adopt a
lower level of mens rea.  It is quite properly not suggested that there
is any constitutional impediment in this regard.

 

C.  Effect of Film
Review Board Approval

 

105   In
reaching her conclusion, Newton Prov. Div. J. acknowledged the fact
that the appellants had relied upon the approval of the OFRB for all of the
videos in question.  It was further agreed that the appellant, Jorgensen, had
advised the officers of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force and the
Pornography and Hate Literature Section that he purchased only those videos
which had been approved by the OFRB.  In view of these accepted facts, the
issue is whether the appellants' reliance on the OFRB approval effectively
negates the mens rea of the offence or provides the necessary legal
justification or excuse referred to in s. 163(2) .

 

106   In
order to determine the effect of OFRB approval, it is necessary to properly
appreciate what the Board does.  The evidence establishes that while, in
carrying out its mandate to screen films, many of the considerations which
inform a court's decision as to whether certain material is obscene are
relevant to the decision of the OFRB, it does not determine whether the film is
obscene.  The Theatres Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.6, under which the OFRB
operates, does not mention obscenity.  Although the Board would not knowingly
approve a film that was obscene, in the opinion of the Board Chairman, that is
not its function.   According to the evidence of the Board Chairman, the OFRB
attempts to apply a community standard of tolerance and while the Ontario Board
attempts to apply a national standard, the practices of film review boards
across the country differ.

 

107   In
light of this evidence, the trial judge considered that the evidence of OFRB
approval was relevant to the question of community standards.  After reviewing
the nature and mandate at the Board, she notes:

 

          Based on the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination
before me, I am satisfied that his [Mr. Payne, Chairman OFRB] evidence is such
that I cannot reject it as being indicative of community standards of
tolerance.  While I am mindful that he did not view any of the videos before
me, and while some of his evidence would negate current Board approval, I am
satisfied that it is a matter of weight to be attached to his evidence.  

 

108   The
appellants submit that reliance on OFRB approval negated knowledge and the
appellants should be acquitted.  This submission presupposes knowledge on the
part of the appellants which, absent reliance on Board approval, would subject
them to criminal liability.  As explained above, such knowledge must extend to
awareness of the content of the material which, in law, is obscene.  In these
circumstances, the only basis upon which this submission can succeed is that
reliance on approval of the OFRB induced a mistake of fact.  A mistake of law
would not avail unless it constituted a legal justification or excuse, a matter
with which I will deal later in these reasons.

 

          (1)  Effect
of Board Approval on ""Knowingly""

 

109   Did
the OFRB approval involve a factual determination upon which the appellants can
rely to negative knowledge of the offence?  The only aspect of the decision of
the OFRB that might be considered a factual determination is in relation to conformity
with community standards of tolerance.  As I have pointed out above, the trial
judge considered the evidence of the Chairman as relevant to that issue.  The
Chairman's evidence related to the effect of the decision of the OFRB as he had
not viewed the videos and could not give first-hand expert evidence independent
of the effect of the decision of the Board.  In my opinion, however, whether
the impugned material exceeds community standards of tolerance is not a pure
question of fact.  This is a determination that a judge or jury can make
without the assistance of evidence.  While evidence is often adduced and
considered, and indeed desirable, it is not essential.  This issue is resolved
against an accused by a finding by the judge or jury that the subject matter of
the charge exceeds community standards of tolerance.  The Crown need not prove
that the accused knew that it did and the accused cannot rely on a mistake of
fact on the basis that he or she honestly believed that it did not.

 

110   I
find support for this view in the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
in Metro News, supra.  In that case, the publication had been
approved not only by the Customs Prohibited Importation Branch but by an
advisory committee set up to approve or disapprove publication for the guidance
of the industry which had set it up.  The accused relied on a mistake of fact
based on such approval.  The reasons of Martin J.A. for the court contain
an insightful discussion of this question.  Citing Glanville Williams, he
points out that the distinction between law and fact which is made for the
purpose of allocating issues as between judge and jury does not necessarily
apply with respect to mistake of fact.  As an example, the authorities
establish that in respect of a charge of undue lessening of competition, while
whether an agreement restricts competition is treated for some purposes as a
question of fact, proof of intent to do so is unnecessary and mistake of fact
does not apply.  Martin J.A. concludes as follows, at pp. 66-67:

 

          In my view, what is an ""undue"" exploitation of sex
under s. 159(8) or whether the allegedly obscene matter exceeded the community
standard of tolerance constitutes what Glanville Williams terms a
value-judgment to which the doctrine of mistake of fact is inapplicable.  He
states in Textbook of Criminal Law, 2nd ed. (1983), p. 141:

 

Where a rule of law involves the making of a
value-judgment, the doctrine of mens rea does not generally apply in
respect of the value-judgment.

 

""On an issue of negligence, for example, the
question whether what the defendant did was `negligent' on the one hand or
`reasonable' on the other involves a judgment of value made by the jury (or, of
course, by magistrates), and the question whether the defendant knew that he
was being negligent is not controlling.  Similarly a defence of self-defence is
excluded if the jury think that the defendant reacted disproportionately, even
though he considered that it was proportionate (s. 21.3); and a defence of
necessity is excluded if the jury think that what the defendant had in mind to
do was not socially justified, even though he thought it was (s. 24.12). 
However, where the judge is of opinion that no reasonable jury would convict he
should direct an acquittal.""

 

          The instances just given are all
value-judgments, which are intermediate between questions of fact and questions
of law.  As with questions of law, the defendant's failure to foresee the
decision of the court does not excuse him.

 

(Emphasis supplied [by Martin J.A.].)  And further at pp. 142-3:

 

          Similar problems beset the crime of
obscenity (the publishing of an obscene article, or having an obscene article
for publication for gain), under the Obscene Publications Act 1959, as amended
by an Act of 1964.  The test of whether an article is obscene under the Act, as
at common law, is whether

 

""its effect . . . is, if taken as a whole,
such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to
all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or
embodied in it"" (s. 1(1)).

 

          Here again the jury make the decision on
the supposed question of fact without regard to what the defendant thought, and
however reasonably he may have believed that the article would not deprave and
corrupt.

 

111   Rather
than create an intermediate area between fact and law, I prefer to characterize
this question as a mixed question of fact and law.  As such, as a general rule,
the Crown need not prove intent or knowledge where these mind states are
otherwise an essential ingredient of the offence, nor can the accused rely on a
mistake of fact in relation to the issue.  Accordingly, if the Crown
establishes that the appellants knew of the presence of the ingredients of the
video which the tribunal finds exceed community standards, in accordance with
the principles in Butler, that is sufficient for a conviction.  It is
unnecessary for the Crown to prove or the tribunal to find that the appellants
knew that the video exceeded the community's standard of tolerance.  

 

          (2)  Board
Approval as Lawful Justification or Excuse

 

112   Two
propositions which are somewhat related militate against the submission that
OFRB approval can constitute a lawful justification or excuse.  First, one
level of government cannot delegate its legislative powers to another.  Second,
approval by a provincial body cannot as a matter of constitutional law preclude
the prosecution of a charge under the Criminal Code .

 

113   With
respect to the first proposition, in Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport
Board, [1968] S.C.R. 569, Cartwright J. stated, at p. 574:

 

          It is made clear by the judgment of this Court in Attorney
General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada, [1951] S.C.R. 31, and
by the earlier decisions of the Judicial Committee and of this Court collected
and discussed in the reasons delivered in that case, that neither Parliament
nor a Provincial Legislature is capable of delegating to the other or of receiving
from the other any of the powers to make laws conferred upon it by the British
North America Act.  

 

114   The
jurisprudence with respect to the second proposition is quite unequivocal.  In R.
v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd. and Powers (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 251 (Man.
C.A.), the accused were charged under s. 150(1) (now s. 163(1) ) which,
unlike s. 163(2)  (then s. 150(2)), did not provide for a defence of lawful
excuse or justification.  The defendants, however, argued that they had acted
under a mistake of fact as they believed that the material found to be obscene
had been admitted into Canada by Canada Customs officials and, therefore, there
would be no breach of s. 150(1) by distributing it.  Freedman J.A. wrote
(at p. 261):

 

We must remember that under the Criminal Code  it is for the
Court, and not the Customs Department, to determine whether or not a
publication is obscene.  A determination of obscenity is then followed by the
imposition of a penalty or punishment under the terms of the law.  To say that
non-prohibition of these publications by the Customs Department has the effect
here claimed would be to deprive the Court of its proper function.  It would
effectively transfer the adjudication of the issue to the Customs Department. 

 

 

 

115   In
McFall, the court reached a similar conclusion notwithstanding that the
defence of lawful justification or excuse was available as a defence.  The
accused was charged with ""knowingly and without lawful justification or excuse""
having possession of obscene films for the purpose of exposing them to public
view contrary to s. 159(2)(a) (now s. 163(2) (a)) of the
Code.  During the trial, the accused called the provincial censor who
testified that he had approved the films in question.  The court ruled that
provincial censor approval of a film could not excuse the commission of the
offence.  The court noted that a censor is not required to use the
considerations laid out in the obscenity jurisprudence in respect of the interpretation
of s. 159(8) (now s. 163(8) ) of the Code.  As a result, it was
the court's view that censor approval, though lawful, does not mean that the
film is not obscene, but is merely evidence which the jury may consider in
reaching its conclusion on the issue of obscenity.  Taggart J.A. writes, at
p. 212: 

 

I am of the opinion that if the appellants are to succeed on the issue
of lawful justification or excuse they must show something more than approval
by a provincial film classification director who, though he may have great
experience in ascertaining what is the British Columbia community standard of
tolerance, has no obligation to have any of the considerations referred to in
the foregoing authorities in mind when he grants approval for the showing of films
under a designated classification.  

 

116   The
apparent decisiveness of the law prompted counsel to concede the point in Towne
Cinema Theatres Ltd. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 494.  Dickson C.J.,
speaking for himself and Lamer and Le Dain JJ., noted (at pp. 511 and
516-17): 

 

Counsel for the appellant does not contend that censor board approval is
a bar to a criminal prosecution.  He readily concedes that it is for the courts
to decide whether a publication is obscene (Daylight Theatre Co. v. The
Queen (supra); R. v. McFall (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181
(B.C.C.A.)).

 

                                .
. .

 

          As I have indicated, the defence did lead evidence of Mr.
Hooper, the Chairman of the Alberta Censor Board for the purpose of showing
that the film did not fall below contemporary community standards.  The trial
judge made only one reference to this evidence:

 

          Now, whether or not the film was
approved by the Censor Board, as far as I am concerned, has nothing whatsoever
to do with whether or not the Crown can prefer an indictment against it for
providing an immoral, indecent or obscene performance.  The Court is the one
that has to decide that.

 

          The law is clear that a trier of fact does not have to
accept testimony, whether expert or otherwise.  He can reject it, in whole or
in part.  He cannot, however, reject it without good reason.  [Emphasis
added.]  

 

The fourth member of the
majority on this point, Wilson J., stated as follows in separate concurring
reasons, at p. 531:

 

There is no question that the approval of the censor board does not
preclude the preferring of an indictment.  

 

117   In
the face of these propositions which are based on recent decisions of this
Court, I find it difficult to accede to the argument that in using the words
""lawful justification or excuse"" Parliament intended that conduct
which is criminalized by s. 163(2)  is rendered lawful or the person
engaging in it is excused as a result of a decision of a provincial body.  

 

118   While
Parliament has the authority to introduce dispensation or exemption from
criminal law in determining what is and what is not criminal, and may do so by
authorizing a provincial body or official acting under provincial legislation
to issue licences and the like, an intent to do so must be made plain.  In R.
v. Furtney, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 89, this Court dealt with an example of the
exercise of such authority which is contained in the provisions of s. 207 
of the Criminal Code .  Section 207  exempts from criminal liability
lotteries which had obtained a licence issued by the Lieutenant Governor under
specified terms and conditions.  At pages 104-5, Stevenson J. set out the
circumstances under which Parliament may delegate:

 

          Thus Parliament may delegate legislative authority to bodies
other than provincial legislatures, it may incorporate provincial legislation
by reference and it may limit the reach of its legislation by a condition,
namely the existence of provincial legislation.  

 

119   As
Furtney illustrates, the exercise of this power by Parliament, however,
must be in terms which are sufficiently specific that exemption from criminal
liability is not left to the unfettered discretion of provincial legislation. 
If censor boards, empowered by provincial legislation, can justify or excuse
persons who rely on them from the obscenity provision, the criminal law in this
regard would for all intents and purposes be administered by the provincial
legislatures.  The terms under which censor boards operate vary from province
to province with the result that conduct that is criminal in one province would
be justified in another province.  Surely this is not what Parliament intended
in continuing the use of the words ""lawful justification or excuse""
in respect of the offence of selling material which is obscene.

 

120   In
considering Parliament's intention in this regard, it must be remembered that
the issue of the application of a lawful justification or excuse only arises
once the Crown has proved all elements of the offence beyond a reasonable
doubt.  This would involve proof that the accused knew of the specific contents
of the material which render it obscene.  See R. v. Santeramo (1976), 32
C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont. C.A.).  While it is difficult and perhaps undesirable to
attempt to define what would constitute a lawful justification or excuse, such
examples as are derived from the cases support the conclusion which I have
reached.  In Kiverago, supra, Gale C.J.O., speaking for the
court, stated, at p. 465:

 

In other words, s-s. (2) seems to us to suggest that, even assuming the
material is obscene, the person who exposes it cannot be guilty of an offence
unless he knows that he has exposed it and does not have some lawful
justification or excuse for doing so and, of course, we have in mind as
examples of justification or excuse medical or scientific books containing
obscene material, for legitimate purposes of education, scientific research and
matters of that kind.  

 

121   In
Perka v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, Dickson J. (as he then
was) considered whether the defence of necessity constituted a justification or
excuse of the offence of importing narcotics and possession of narcotics for
the purpose of trafficking.  Speaking for the majority, Dickson J.
stressed the importance of distinguishing between ""justification"" and
""excuse"".  The former challenges the wrongfulness of the action while
the latter concedes the wrongfulness of the action but asserts that due to the
circumstances the actor should be exempted from responsibility for it.  The
rationale upon which the actor is excused is ""the perceived injustice of
punishing violations of the law in circumstances in which the person had no
other viable or reasonable choice available; the act was wrong but it is
excused because it was realistically unavoidable"" (p. 250).

 

122   There
is no basis upon which it could be said that the conduct in this case, which
involves the sale of obscene material, could be said to be justified by the
circumstances.  It is not contended that the approval by the OFRB per se
could have the effect of making the conduct rightful.  Rather it is alleged
that it is the reliance on the approval of the OFRB by the appellants that
excuses them.  In my view, it cannot be said that in the circumstances if the
appellants knew of the contents of the videos, sale of them was realistically
unavoidable.  In all the circumstances, therefore, I conclude that Parliament
could not have intended to excuse the sale of obscene material by reason only
of reliance on an approval by a provincial censor board.  

 

123   After
preparation of these reasons, I read the reasons of the Chief Justice.  I have
not considered the issue of officially induced error of law as an excuse in
this appeal because the matter was not raised either here or in the courts
below.  Nothing in these reasons should be taken as agreeing or disagreeing
with the reasons of the Chief Justice but I would prefer to address the issue
of officially induced error in a case in which it is properly raised and
argued.

 

VI.  Summary

 

124   To
summarize, I have concluded that the Crown must prove knowledge on the part of
an accused charged with an offence under s. 163(2) (a), not only
that the accused was aware that the subject matter had as its dominant
characteristic the exploitation of sex but that the accused knew of the
presence of the ingredients of the subject matter which as a matter of law
rendered the exploitation of sex undue.  In this regard, in appropriate
circumstances the Crown can avail itself of the principles of wilful
blindness.  The approval of the subject matter by a provincial censor board may
be relevant to the determination of community standards of tolerance and on the
issue of wilful blindness.  It is not relevant with respect to the issue of the
accused's knowledge, and the Crown need not prove that the accused knew that
the subject matter of the charge exceeded community standards.  Furthermore,
approval by a provincial censor board does not constitute a justification or
excuse.

 

VII.  Disposition

 

125   There
was no evidence to suggest any knowledge on the part of the appellants, beyond
the fact that the videos in question were sex films in the general sense that
they involved the exploitation of sex.  Since I have concluded that this does
not satisfy the mens rea requirements of s. 163(2) , the appellants
are entitled to an acquittal.  The appeal is, therefore, allowed, the judgments
below are set aside and a verdict of acquittal is substituted.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
british columbia

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Charge to jury ‑‑ Recharge ‑‑ Meaning of reasonable
doubt ‑‑ Accused convicted of sexual assault ‑‑ Whether
portions of trial judge's recharge to jury on meaning and application of
reasonable doubt amounted to reversible error.

 

                   The accused was
convicted of five counts of sexual assault.  Shortly after beginning their
deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge requesting further
instructions concerning the definition of reasonable doubt.  In his recharge in
response to the query, the trial judge made the following three impugned
statements:  (1) ""If you believe that the accused is probably guilty
or likely guilty but still have a reasonable doubt, you must give the benefit
of that doubt to the accused""; (2) ""After examining all of the
evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is
guilty or not guilty""; (3) ""If you are unanimous in that doubt
you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused"".  A majority of
the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the recharge did not amount to
reversible error, and the conviction was accordingly upheld.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Questions from the
jury must be answered in a careful, complete and correct manner.  In light of
the importance of the burden of proof and reasonable doubt filter to the
integrity and reliability of a verdict and to the fairness of an accused's
trial, a trial judge's instructions must be careful, lucid and scrupulously
sound.  In assessing whether a trial judge's instructions on the burden of
proof amount to reversible error, a court must consider:  (i) whether the
impugned instruction is inconsistent with what was said in the initial charge
or is simply erroneous standing by itself; and (ii) whether, after placing
the inconsistency or error in the context of the charge as a whole, there is a
reasonable possibility that the jury might have been misled by those
instructions into either applying a standard of proof less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt or improperly applying the burden of proof or reasonable doubt
standard in arriving at their verdict.  Here the first passage complained of,
when read in the context of the whole charge, could not have misled the jury
into applying a standard of proof less than the required proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  While the second impugned passage would have been confusing
for the jury, this in itself would not be sufficient to order a new trial.  The
third passage, which instructed the jury that they must be unanimous in their
doubt before they could acquit, however, is clearly an error.  While a jury's
verdict must be unanimous, jurors may arrive at that verdict by taking
different routes.  This instruction tainted all of the trial judge's earlier
instructions on reasonable doubt.  Coupled with the previous instruction, there
is a reasonable possibility that the trial judge's erroneous instruction may
have misled the jury into improperly applying the reasonable doubt standard in
arriving at their verdict.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

I.                 Lamer
C.J. -- This appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered from the
bench on October 11, 1995, with reasons to follow.  These reasons are as
follows.

 

II.                This case comes to this Court as
of right from the decision of a five-member panel of the British Columbia Court
of Appeal ((1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 1) on the narrow point of law of whether
portions of the trial judge's recharge to the jury on the meaning and
application of reasonable doubt amounted to reversible error.  In the court
below, the appellant raised the additional issue of whether it is appropriate
to define reasonable doubt in terms of ""moral certainty"".  It appears
that the original three-member panel of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
decided to adjourn the proceedings and reconvene as a five-member panel.  The
court then invited counsel ""to canvass fully the proper instruction to be
given to a jury on the meaning of reasonable doubt"" (p. 42).

 

III.               At the outset I wish to state that
we were not asked by either party to address the broader issues of how the
concept of reasonable doubt should be defined to a jury and whether ""moral
certainty"" language should be used in that definition.  Therefore, our
opinion should in no way be construed as either endorsing or rejecting the
model jury charge on reasonable doubt advanced by a majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

I.                 Factual
Background

 

IV.              The appellant was convicted of five
counts of sexual assault. The offences for which the appellant was convicted
involved the touching or fondling of prepubescent school girls by the
appellant, who was their teacher.  The incidents occurred some years prior to
the laying of the charges.  The evidence pitted the allegations of the
complainants against a denial of any wrongdoing by the appellant.  Credibility
was the key issue in the case, and with the exception of the similar fact
evidence of two other students, there was little or no evidence to support
either version of what happened.

 

II.                Issues

 

V.                The appellant appeals his
conviction to this Court as of right on the basis of Wood J.A.'s dissent in the
court below.  That dissent was grounded upon the following questions of law:

 

 

(1)
Did the trial judge's instruction to the jury that ""[i]f you believe that
the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty but still have a reasonable
doubt, you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused and return a
verdict of not guilty"" constitute reversible error when considered in
relation to the charge as a whole?

 

(2)Did
the trial judge's instruction to the jury that ""after examining all of the
evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is
guilty or not guilty"" constitute reversible error when considered in
relation to the charge as a whole?

 

(3)Did
the trial judge's instruction to the jury that ""if you are unanimous in
that doubt you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused""
constitute reversible error when considered in relation to the charge as a
whole? 

 

(4)If
the learned trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury on the application
or definition of reasonable doubt, should the provisions of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  be applied?

 

VI.              At the oral hearing both parties
agreed that the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , does not arise out of Wood J.A.'s dissent.  I agree with
this interpretation of the parameters of the dissent since the majority opinion
did not find it necessary to address the s. 686(1) (b)(iii) issue.  I
would further add that I have some reservations as to whether s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
would ever be available to cure an erroneous instruction which may have misled
a jury into improperly applying the burden of proof or reasonable doubt
standard.

 

III.               Decisions Below

 

VII.             In summarizing the decisions below,
I have only included the excerpts from the charge and recharge and Court of
Appeal judgments relevant to the issues raised in this appeal.  

 

A.  Charge to the Jury

 

VIII.            The trial judge instructed the jury
on the meaning and application of reasonable doubt in the following fashion:

 

 

                   As
I told you at the outset, and you may be getting tired of hearing this, but I
must emphasize it because it is so important and must not be forgotten - it is
a fundamental principle of our law that every accused person is presumed
innocent.  That presumption continues, it continues now and it will continue
until you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. 
That burden stays with the Crown throughout.  It is not a responsibility of the
accused to demonstrate or establish or prove his innocence.  If the Crown fails
to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt you must acquit the accused.

 

                   What
does reasonable doubt mean? There is no simple answer except to say that the
phrase perhaps defines itself.  It is a doubt based upon reason as opposed to a
doubt based upon imagination or speculation. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt
may be described as being achieved when there is a moral certainty in your mind
that the accused committed the offence.  If, for example, you conclude that the
accused probably committed the offence and no more then you have a reasonable
doubt and it is your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.

 

                   You
must assess the credibility of the witnesses that you heard in this trial. 
That is the central issue.  In doing so, you should bring to bear upon the
question of credibility your own life experience and common sense.  You may
believe all of the evidence of a witness, a portion of the evidence given by a
witness, or none of the evidence given by a witness....

 

                   There
are three things that I want to tell you that I would like you to keep in mind,
keeping in mind that the accused has given evidence: Firstly, if you believe
the accused, obviously you must acquit; secondly, if you do not believe the
evidence of the accused but are left with a reasonable doubt by that evidence,
you must acquit; finally, if you are not left in a reasonable doubt by the
evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the
evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by
that evidence of the guilt of the accused.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   Finally,
keep in mind that the accused cannot be convicted of any offence unless you are
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

. .
. I must remind you to keep in mind my directions to you about the issue of
reasonable doubt.  The choice is not one side or the other.  You must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the incidents complained of in fact
occurred....

 

                   I
leave you with a reminder of the final issue you must face.  If you have a
reasonable doubt concerning the guilt of the accused you must give the benefit
of that doubt to the accused and find him not guilty.  You are not doing him
any favour by doing so, you are merely doing your duty as cast upon you by law.
On the other hand, if you do not have a reasonable doubt concerning the guilt
of the accused you must find him guilty as charged, that too is your plain duty
and the law requires no more from you than that.

 

The jury was then sent out to
deliberate.  After 11 minutes, a note was sent to the judge requesting further
instructions.  The note said:

 

At
the beginning of Judge's summation define reasonable doubt, define moral
certainty, guidelines mentioned at beginning of summation.

 

In response, the judge gave this
recharge which I quote in its entirety:

 

                   If
I may deal with your last point first, guidelines at the beginning of my
summation.  I suggested to you and I suggest to you now that you decide this
case on the evidence in this courtroom and on nothing else.  We have separate
functions: The facts are for you and the law is for me.  It is your duty to
weigh the evidence and come to your own on conclusions about what you believe
and what you do not believe. 

 

                   It
is a fundamental principle of our law that every accused person is presumed to
be innocent, that presumption continues until there is put before you a body of
evidence which satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt. 
That burden stays with the Crown throughout this trial and does not shift.  It
is not the responsibility of the accused to establish or demonstrate or prove
his innocence.  If the Crown fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt you
must acquit the accused.

 

                   You
asked me to define reasonable doubt and moral certainty.  You may find that I
am of less assistance to you in that regard.  What I had said to you was this:
That there is no simple answer to the question of what is a reasonable doubt
except to say that it is a phrase that defines itself because it is a doubt
based upon reason, as opposed to a doubt based upon imagination or speculation.

 

                   I
can expand on it in this fashion in the hopes that it is of some assistance to
you.  A reasonable doubt may arise from the evidence, a conflict in the
evidence or a lack of evidence. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon
reason.  It is not an imaginary doubt.  It is sometimes put in this fashion in
an effort to convey what is meant, it is sometimes described to juries in this
fashion.  If you are morally certain or feel sure that the accused committed
the offences, you do not have a reasonable doubt.  If you believe that the
accused is probably guilty or likely guilty but still have a reasonable doubt,
you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused and return a verdict
of not guilty.  On the other hand, you must not set up a standard of absolute
certainty that the Crown must meet in order to prove guilt.  You must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

 

                   I
add this comment, you may have trouble deciding which witnesses you believe and
which witnesses you do not believe.  You should know that the rule of
reasonable doubt also applies to the issue of credibility.  You need not definitely
decide on the credibility of a witness or group of witnesses.  You need not
fully believe or disbelieve one witness or a number of witnesses.

 

                   After
examining all of the evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. If you are unanimous in that doubt
you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused. [Emphasis added.]

 

B.  British Columbia Court of
Appeal (1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 1

 

                   (i) Majority

 

                   (a) McEachern
C.J.B.C. (Goldie and Rowles JJ.A. concurring)

 

IX.              The Chief Justice was satisfied
that the recharge did not rise to the level of reversible error.  He considered
the two passages which were alleged to have been in error:

 

If
you believe that the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty but still
have a reasonable doubt, you must give the benefit of that doubt to the
accused and return a verdict of not guilty. [Emphasis added.]

 

and;

 

After
examining all of the evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.  If you are unanimous in that
doubt you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused. [Emphasis
added.]

 

X.                The Chief Justice did not think
that the first passage, when read in context of the whole charge, could have
misled the jury into applying the wrong standard of proof.  He was also
satisfied that the second passage was not in error. While he found the words
""or not guilty"" to be unnecessary, he was of the view that they were
not inaccurate because the jury may well have had a doubt about either
alternative.  The second sentence in the second impugned passage caused him
greater difficulty.  It contained a clear mistake, undoubtedly a judicial slip
of the tongue, since this experienced trial judge knew there was no need for
the jury to be unanimous in whatever doubt it entertained.  However, he found
it significant that the trial judge told the jury on several occasions that the
benefit of the doubt must be given to the appellant and that at no time was the
jury told it could only acquit if it was unanimous.  Moreover, in several
passages, the trial judge properly instructed them on the proper standard of
proof.  The Chief Justice was also of the view that this particular instruction
was still generally favourable to the appellant because it reminded the jury
that the appellant was entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  Therefore,
McEachern C.J.B.C. concluded that the jury would not have been misled by this
unfortunate instruction.  He found it probable that the jury, rather than
parsing the sentence, would have regarded the sentence as a reminder that the
benefit of the doubt always went to the appellant. 

 

                   (b) Gibbs J.A.
(concurring with McEachern C.J.B.C. in the result)

 

XI.              Upon reading the charge as a whole,
Gibbs J.A. concluded that, with one possible exception, the appeal could not
succeed.  The exception arose from three words (""or not guilty"") in
the last paragraph of the recharge:

 

                   After
examining all of the evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.  If you are unanimous in
that doubt you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused. [Emphasis
added.]

 

XII.             Gibbs J.A. noted that there was no
doubt that a direction that a jury could rest its verdict upon a finding of
reasonable doubt that the accused was not guilty was wrong.  He concluded that
this error fell into the category of slips of the tongue which would not have
misled the jury.  According to his Lordship, the charge began with an accurate
explanation that a person was presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt and that an accused person was not called upon to prove
innocence and ended with a reminder that the Crown must prove all elements of
the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  Gibbs J.A. was also of the opinion that
the request from the jury that led to the recharge was not a question about the
burden of proof or the presumption of innocence but rather a request for
further explanation of the concepts of reasonable doubt and moral certainty. 
Consequently, he was not persuaded, looking at the charge as a whole, that the
jury would have been likely misled by the unfortunate misstatement.  He was
satisfied it was simply a slip of the judicial tongue. 

 

                   (ii) Dissent

 

XIII.            Wood J.A. found that there was
reversible error in the emphasized portions of the last paragraph of the
recharge:

 

                   After
examining all of the evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.  If you are unanimous in that
doubt you must give the benefit of that doubt to the accused. [Emphasis
added.]

 

XIV.            His Lordship was of the opinion that
the application of a reasonable doubt analysis to the innocence of the accused
detracted from the principle of fundamental justice that mandated the
presumption of innocence as the starting point for any inquiry into guilt. 
Moreover, he stated that it was the verdict, not the reasonable doubt, upon
which the jury must be unanimous.  He found that to require a jury to agree
unanimously on the basis for concluding that a reasonable doubt as to guilt
existed not only was wrong as a matter of law, but also had the effect of
imposing a persuasive burden on the accused.  Since these two errors fell in
the final instructions to the jury, they were fatal to the verdicts.

 

XV.             Wood J.A. also found reversible
error in that part of the recharge which instructed the jury that ""if you
believe that the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty but still have
a reasonable doubt"" (emphasis added).  In his opinion (at p. 18):

 

                   This
instruction reinforces the potential for confusion arising from the other
errors already referred to, and enhances the likelihood that the jury was
induced to apply the wrong standard of proof in this case.  In this respect I
agree with the brief reasons found in the Ontario Court of Appeal endorsement
in the Ford case, in which a similar form of instruction was criticized
in the following terms:

 

. .
. [it] might imply that even though their thinking did not extend beyond a
belief that the accused were probably guilty, nevertheless [the accused] could
be found guilty. 

 

IV.              Analysis 

 

(i) The Import of Jury Questions

 

XVI.            This Court has on a number of
occasions highlighted the importance of answering jury queries in a careful,
complete and correct manner:  see R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742; R.
v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122; R. v. Pétel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3; and R.
v. S. (W.D.), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521.  In Naglik, I held, writing for
the majority, at p. 139:

 

Answers
to questions from the jury are extremely important, and carry influence far
exceeding instructions given in the main charge. If the jury asks a question
about an issue addressed in the main charge, it is clear that they did not
understand or remember that part of the main charge, and it is also clear that
they must exclusively rely on the answer given by the trial judge to resolve
any confusion or debate on the point which may have taken place in the jury
room during their deliberations up to that point.

 

XVII.          In this case the jury, after
deliberating for 11 minutes, sent a note to the trial judge asking him to
define again the concepts of reasonable doubt and moral certainty.  The jury
also asked the judge to repeat the guidelines he had given to them prior to his
review of the evidence, guidelines which dealt with the presumption of
innocence and the burden of proof.  Consequently, I take it as being implicit
in the jury's question that they were also seeking further guidance on how to
apply the concept of reasonable doubt to the evidence. 

 

(ii)  When Will a Trial Judge's
Instructions on the Burden of Proof Amount to

      Reversible Error?

 

 

XVIII.         In light of the importance of the burden
of proof and reasonable doubt filter to the integrity and reliability of a
verdict and to the fairness of an accused's trial and giving due weight to the
reality, highlighted by Wood J.A. (at p. 10), that:

 

 

. .
. the application to the evidence of the law relating to the burden of proof in
a criminal case can pose great difficulty, particularly for a jury of lay
people who are confronted with that task for the first, and probably the only,
time in their lives.

 

a trial judge's instructions must be
careful, lucid and scrupulously sound.

 

XIX.            In assessing whether a trial judge's
recharge (or in some cases the main charge) on the burden of proof amounts to
reversible error, a court must consider:

 

(i)whether
the impugned instruction is inconsistent with what was said in the initial
charge or is simply erroneous standing by itself; and,

 

(ii)whether,
after placing the inconsistency or error in the context of the charge as a
whole, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury might have been misled
by those instructions into either applying a standard of proof less than proof
beyond a reasonable doubt or improperly applying the burden of proof or
reasonable doubt standard in arriving at their verdict.

 

I am of the opinion that there is a
greater risk that the jury may be misled when the erroneous instructions are
found in a recharge which was in response to a jury question concerning the
burden of proof and/or reasonable doubt.

 

(iii) Did the Recharge in this Case
Amount to Reversible Error?

 

XX.             The appellant complains about three
portions of the trial judge's recharge to the jury on the meaning and
application of reasonable doubt:

 

                   (a)""if
you believe that the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty but still have
a reasonable doubt, you must give the benefit of that doubt to the
accused""

 

XXI.            This passage in the recharge is
consistent with the main charge wherein the jury was told, albeit more clearly:

 

If,
for example, you conclude that the accused probably committed the offence and
no more then you have a reasonable doubt and it is your duty to return a
verdict of not guilty. [Emphasis added.]

 

While it would have been preferable
for the trial judge to use the word ""even"" before the words ""if
you believe"" and to use ""therefore"" or ""thus"" instead
of ""but"" in his recharge, I agree with the majority of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal that when read in the context of the whole charge, the
passage could not have misled the jury into applying a standard of proof less
than the required proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

XXII.          I wish to add that in my opinion
instructing a jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not met if
the jurors can only conclude that the accused is ""probably"" or
""likely"" guilty is quite a useful manner in which to convey the
meaning of such an elusive concept.

 

                   (b)""after
examining all of the evidence you may be left with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused is guilty or not guilty""

 

XXIII.         I am of the view that this passage from
the recharge, while technically correct, would have been confusing for the
jury, even giving due consideration to Cory J.'s reflection in W. (D.), supra,
at p. 761, that ""[t]oday's jurors are intelligent and conscientious,
anxious to perform their duties as jurors in the best possible manner"". 
However, this in itself would not be sufficient to order a new trial.

 

                   (c)""if
you are unanimous in that doubt you must give the benefit of that doubt to the
accused""

 

XXIV.         I find this impugned passage to be much
more troubling than the previous ones I have just dealt with.  Instructing a
jury that they must be unanimous in their doubt before they can acquit is
clearly an error.  It is inconsistent with this Court's decision in R. v.
Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, which held that while a jury's verdict had
to be unanimous, jurors could arrive at that verdict by taking different
routes.  This instruction tainted all of the trial judge's earlier instructions
on reasonable doubt.

 

XXV.          It is my opinion that, coupled with the
previous instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the trial judge's
erroneous instruction may have misled the jury into improperly applying the
reasonable doubt standard in arriving at their verdict.  Consequently, I would
allow the appeal and order a new trial on all five counts of the indictment.

new trial ordered.

Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Medical and counselling records ‑‑ Procedure to be followed where
accused seeks production of records in hands of third parties.

 








The accused was charged with a number of sexual
offences.  Defence counsel obtained a pre‑trial order requiring that the
Crown disclose the complainants' entire medical, counselling and school records
and that the complainants authorize production of such records.  The Crown
applied to a different judge for directions regarding the disclosure order and
for the early appointment of a trial judge.  After a trial judge had been
appointed, the Crown again sought directions regarding the disclosure order. 
By this time many of the impugned records had come into its possession.  The
trial judge made it clear that he was to be provided promptly with therapy records
relating to all four complainants.  The accused later applied for a judicial
stay of proceedings based on non‑disclosure of several items.  Crown
counsel submitted that the two Crown prosecutors were handling the case from
different cities, and that there were difficulties concerning communication and
organization.  She asserted that the non‑disclosure of some of the
medical records was due to inadvertence on her part, and that she had
""dreamt"" the transcripts of certain interviews had been disclosed. 
She submitted that uninhibited disclosure of medical and therapeutic records
would revictimize the victims, and suggested that the disclosure order
exhibited gender bias.  The trial judge dismissed the application for a stay,
finding that the failure to disclose certain medical records had been an
oversight.  He noted, however, that the letters written by Crown counsel to the
counsellors had unacceptably limited the scope of the disclosure to only those
portions of the records which related directly to the incidents involving the
accused.  This resulted in the full therapy records not being disclosed to the
defence until just before the trial.  He concluded that while the conduct of
the Crown was ""disturbing"", he did not believe that there was a
""grand design"" to conceal evidence, nor any ""deliberate plan to
subvert justice"".  In light of the difficulties encountered during
discovery, Crown counsel then agreed to waive any privilege with respect to the
contents of the Crown's file and to prepare a binder in relation to each of the
complainants containing all information in the Crown's possession relating to
each of them.  On the second day of the trial, counsel for the accused made
another application for a judicial stay of proceedings based largely on the fact
that the Crown was still unable to guarantee to the accused that full
disclosure had been made.  The trial judge stayed proceedings on all four
counts.  He noted the constant intervention required by the court to ensure
full compliance with the disclosure order and found that the Crown's earlier
conduct had created ""an aura"" that had pervaded and ultimately
destroyed the case.  The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and
directed a new trial.  This appeal raises the issues of (1) when non‑disclosure
by the Crown justifies an order that the proceedings be stayed and (2) the
appropriate procedure to be followed when an accused seeks production of
documents such as medical or therapeutic records that are in the hands of third
parties.

 








Held (Lamer C.J. and Sopinka and Major JJ. dissenting):  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

(1)  Stay of Proceedings

 








Per La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  There is no need to
maintain any type of distinction between the common law doctrine of abuse of
process and Charter requirements regarding abusive conduct.  Where an
accused seeks to establish that non-disclosure by the Crown has violated s. 7,
he or she must establish that the impugned non-disclosure has, on the balance
of probabilities, prejudiced or had an adverse effect on his or her ability to
make full answer and defence.  Such a determination requires reasonable inquiry
into the materiality of the non‑disclosed information.  Inferences or
conclusions about the propriety of the Crown's conduct or intention are not
necessarily relevant to whether or not the accused's right to a fair trial is
infringed.  The focus must be primarily on the effect of the impugned actions
on the fairness of the trial.  Once a violation is made out, the court must
fashion a just and appropriate remedy, pursuant to s. 24(1).  Where the
adverse impact upon the accused's ability to make full answer and defence is
curable by a disclosure order, then such a remedy, combined with an adjournment
where necessary to enable defence counsel to review the disclosed information,
will generally be appropriate.  There may, however, be exceptional situations
where, given the advanced state of the proceedings, it is simply not possible
to remedy the prejudice.  In those ""clearest of cases"", a stay of
proceedings will be appropriate.  When choosing a remedy for a non-disclosure
that has violated s. 7, the court should also consider whether the Crown's
breach of its disclosure obligations has violated fundamental principles
underlying the community's sense of decency and fair play and thereby caused
prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system.  If so, it should be asked
whether this prejudice is remediable, having regard to the seriousness of the
violation and to the societal and individual interests in obtaining a
determination of guilt or innocence.  

 

While the Crown's conduct in this case was shoddy and
inappropriate, the non‑disclosure cannot be said to have violated the
accused's right to full answer and defence.  The whole issue of disclosure in
this case arose out of the order requiring that the Crown ""disclose""
records in the hands of third parties and that the complainants authorize
production of such records.  This order was issued without any form of inquiry
into their relevance, let alone a balancing of the privacy rights of the
complainants and the accused's right to a fair trial, and was thus wrong.  The
Crown was ultimately right in trying to protect the interests of justice, and
the fact that it did so in such a clumsy way should not result in a stay of
proceedings, particularly when no prejudice was demonstrated to the fairness of
the accused's trial or to his ability to make full answer and defence.  Even
had a violation of s. 7 been found, this cannot be said to be one of the
""clearest of cases"" which would mandate a stay of proceedings.

 

Per Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.:  While the actions of Crown counsel originally responsible
for the prosecution of this case were extremely high‑handed and thoroughly
reprehensible, the Crown's misdeeds were not such that, upon a consideration of
all the circumstances, the drastic remedy of a stay was merited.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka and Major JJ. (dissenting on this issue):  A stay of proceedings
was appropriate here.  The Crown's conduct impaired the accused's ability to
make full answer and defence.  The impropriety of the disclosure order if any
does not excuse the Crown's failure to comply with it until immediately before
the trial.  The Crown never took proper action regarding the objections it
had.  If it could not appeal the order it should have returned to the issuing
judge to request variation or rescission.  The letters from the Crown
prosecutor to the therapists narrowed the scope of the order.  As soon as the
order was clarified for the therapists, complete records were disclosed,
suggesting that had the letters contained an accurate description of the order,
compliance would have occurred at a much earlier time.  The Crown also breached
its general duty to disclose all relevant information.  Each time disclosure
was made in this case it was the result of the defence having to raise the
matter in court.  The conduct of the Crown was such that trust was lost, first
by the defence, and finally by the trial judge.  It is of little consequence
that a considerable amount of the non‑disclosed material was ultimately
released piecemeal to the defence prior to the trial.  The effect of continual
discovery of more non‑disclosed evidence, coupled with the Crown's
admission that disclosure was possibly incomplete, created an atmosphere in
which the defence's ability to prepare was impaired.  The Crown's delay in
making disclosure and its inability to assure the trial judge that full
disclosure had been made even after commencement of the trial were fatal to the
proceedings.  The continual breaches by the Crown made a stay the appropriate
remedy.  Proceedings had become unworkable and unfair.  Remedies under
s. 24(1) of the Charter are properly in the discretion of the trial
judge.  This discretion should not be interfered with unless the decision was
clearly unreasonable.

 








The same breaches of the disclosure order, the general
duty of disclosure and the undertaking to disclose files to the defence which
impaired the accused's right to make full answer and defence also violated
fundamental principles of justice underlying the community's sense of fair play
and decency.  The trial judge showed admirable tolerance for the behaviour of
the Crown but in the end had no choice but to order a stay.  When a criminal
trial gains notoriety because of the nature of the offence, the parties charged
or any other reason, there is an added burden in the paramount interest of
ensuring fairness in the process.  In this case, the fact that the offences
alleged were many years in the past and that the accused had a high profile in
the community called for a careful prosecution to ensure fairness and the
maintenance of integrity in the process.  The conduct of the Crown during the
time the trial judge was involved, as well as in the months before his
appointment, was negligent, incompetent and unfair.  The trial judge was in the
best position to observe the conduct of the Crown and its effect on the
proceedings.  He found that the trial had become so tainted that it violated
fundamental principles underlying the community's sense of fair play and decency
and that the accused was impaired in his ability to make full answer and
defence.

 

(2)  Production of Records in the Possession of the
Crown

 








Per Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka J.:  The Crown's disclosure obligations established in Stinchcombe
are unaffected by the confidential nature of therapeutic records when the
records are in the possession of the Crown.  The complainant's privacy
interests in therapeutic records need not be balanced against the right of the
accused to make full answer and defence in the context of disclosure, since
concerns relating to privacy or privilege disappear where the documents in
question have fallen into the Crown's possession.  The complainant's lack of a
privacy interest in records that are possessed by the Crown counsels against a
finding of privilege in such records.  Fairness must require that if the
complainant is willing to release this information in order to further the
criminal prosecution, then the accused should be entitled to use the
information in the preparation of his or her defence.  Moreover, any form of
privilege may be forced to yield where such a privilege would preclude the
accused's right to make full answer and defence.  Information in the possession
of the Crown which is clearly relevant and important to the ability of the
accused to raise a defence must be disclosed to the accused, regardless of any
potential claim of privilege that might arise.  While the mere existence of
therapeutic records is insufficient to establish the relevance of those records
to the defence, their relevance must be presumed where the records are in the
Crown's possession.

 

Per Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.:  The principles set out in the Stinchcombe decision,
affirmed in Egger, pertaining to the Crown's duty to disclose must apply
to therapeutic records in the Crown's possession, as found by Lamer C.J.
and Sopinka J.  

 

Per Major J.:  The
Crown's disclosure obligations established in Stinchcombe are unaffected
by the confidential nature of therapeutic records in its possession, as found
by Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  This appeal does not concern the extent of
the Crown's obligation to disclose private records in its possession, or the
question whether privacy and equality interests may militate against such
disclosure by the Crown.  These issues do not arise in this appeal and were not
argued before the Court.  Any comment on these questions would be strictly obiter. 









(3) Production of Records in the Possession of Third Parties

 

Per Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka J.:  When the defence seeks information in the hands of a third
party (as compared to the state), the onus should be on the accused to satisfy
a judge that the information is likely to be relevant.  In order to initiate
the production procedure, the accused must bring a formal written application
supported by an affidavit setting out the specific grounds for production. 
However, the court should be able, in the interests of justice, to waive the
need for a formal application in some cases.  In either event, notice must be
given to third parties in possession of the documents as well as to those
persons who have a privacy interest in the records.  The accused must also
ensure that the custodian and the records are subpoenaed to ensure their
attendance in the court.  The initial application for disclosure should be made
to the judge seized of the trial, but may be brought before the trial judge
prior to the empanelling of the jury, at the same time that other motions are
heard.  In the disclosure context, the meaning of ""relevance"" is
expressed in terms of whether the information may be useful to the defence.  In
the context of production, the test of relevance should be higher:  the
presiding judge must be satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that
the information is logically probative to an issue at trial or the competence
of a witness to testify.  While ""likely relevance"" is the appropriate
threshold for the first stage of the two‑step procedure, it should not be
interpreted as an onerous burden upon the accused.  A relevance threshold, at
this stage, is simply a requirement to prevent the defence from engaging in
speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time‑consuming
requests for production.

 








Upon their production to the court, the judge should
examine the records to determine whether, and to what extent, they should be
produced to the accused.  In making that determination, the judge must examine
and weigh the salutary and deleterious effects of a production order and
determine whether a non‑production order would constitute a reasonable
limit on the ability of the accused to make full answer and defence.  In
balancing the competing rights in question, the following factors should be
considered:  (1) the extent to which the record is necessary for the
accused to make full answer and defence; (2) the probative value of the
record; (3) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy
vested in the record; (4) whether production of the record would be
premised upon any discriminatory belief or bias; and (5) the potential
prejudice to the complainant's dignity, privacy or security of the person that
would be occasioned by production of the record.  The effect on the integrity
of the trial process of producing, or failing to produce, the record, having in
mind the need to maintain consideration in the outcome, is more appropriately
dealt with at the admissibility stage and not in deciding whether the
information should be produced.  As for society's interest in the reporting of
sexual crimes, there are other avenues available to the judge to ensure that
production does not frustrate the societal interests that may be implicated by
the production of the records to the defence.  In applying these factors, it is
also appropriate to bear in mind that production of third party records is
always available to the Crown provided it can obtain a search warrant.

 








Per Cory and
Iacobucci JJ.:  The procedure suggested by Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.
for determining whether records in the possession of third parties are likely
to be relevant was agreed with, as were their reasons pertaining to the nature
of the onus resting upon the accused and the nature of the balancing process
which must be undertaken by the trial judge.

 

Per Major J.:  The
substantive law and the procedure recommended by Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. in
obtaining therapeutic records from third persons were agreed with.

 

Per La Forest,
L'Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier JJ. (dissenting on this issue):  Private
records, or records in which a reasonable expectation of privacy lies, may
include medical or therapeutic records, school records, private diaries and
social worker activity logs.  An order for production of private records held by
third parties does not arise as a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter
since, at the moment of the request for production, the accused's rights under
the Charter have not been violated.  Nonetheless, when deciding whether
to order production of private records, the court must exercise its discretion
in a manner that is respectful of Charter values.  The constitutional
values involved here are the right to full answer and defence, the right to
privacy, and the right to equality without discrimination.

 








Witnesses have a right to privacy in relation to
private documents and records which are not part of the Crown's ""case to
meet"" against the accused.  They are entitled not to be deprived of their
reasonable expectation of privacy except in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice.  Since an applicant seeking production of private records
from third parties is seeking to invoke the power of the State to violate the
privacy rights of other individuals, the applicant must show that the use of
the State power to compel production is justified in a free and democratic
society.  The use of State power to compel production of private records will
be justified in a free and democratic society when the following criteria are
met:  (1) it is shown that the accused cannot obtain the information
sought by any other reasonable means; (2) production that infringes privacy
must be as limited as reasonably possible to fulfil the right to make full
answer and defence; (3) the arguments urging production rest on
permissible chains of reasoning, rather than upon discriminatory assumptions
and stereotypes; and (4) there is proportionality between the salutary and
deleterious effects of production.  The measure of proportionality must reflect
the extent to which a reasonable expectation of privacy vests in the particular
records, on the one hand, and the importance of the issue to which the evidence
relates, on the other.  Moreover, courts must remain alive to the fact that, in
certain cases, the deleterious effects of production may demonstrably include
negative effects on the complainant's course of therapy, threatening
psychological harm to the individual concerned and thereby resulting in a
concomitant deprivation of the individual's security of the person.

 

The first step for an accused who seeks production of
private records held by a third party is to obtain and serve on the third party
a subpoena duces tecum.  When the subpoena is served, the accused should
notify the Crown, the subject of the records, and any other person with an
interest in the confidentiality of the records that the accused will ask the
trial judge for an order for their production.  Then, at the trial, the accused
must bring an application supported by appropriate affidavit evidence showing
that the records are likely to be relevant either to an issue in the trial or
to the competence to testify of the subject of the records.  If the records are
relevant, the court must balance the salutary and deleterious effects of
ordering that the records be produced to determine whether, and to what extent,
production should be ordered.








The records at issue here are not within the
possession or control of the Crown, do not form part of the Crown's ""case
to meet"", and were created by a third party for a purpose unrelated to the
investigation or prosecution of the offence.  It cannot be assumed that such
records are likely to be relevant, and if the accused is unable to show that
they are, then the application for production must be rejected as it amounts to
nothing more than a fishing expedition.  The burden on an accused to
demonstrate likely relevance is a significant one.  It would be insufficient
for the accused to demand production simply on the basis of a bare, unsupported
assertion that the records might impact on ""recent complaint"" or the
""kind of person"" the witness is.  Similarly, the applicant cannot
simply invoke credibility ""at large"", but must rather provide some
basis to show that there is likely to be information in the impugned records
which would relate to the complainant's credibility on a particular, material
issue at trial.  Equally inadequate is a bare, unsupported assertion that a
prior inconsistent statement might be revealed, or that the defence wishes to
explore the records for ""allegations of sexual abuse by other
people"".  Similarly, the mere fact that a witness has a medical or
psychiatric record cannot be taken as indicative of the potential unreliability
of the evidence.  Any suggestion that a particular treatment, therapy, illness,
or disability implies unreliability must be informed by cogent evidence, rather
than stereotype, myth or prejudice.  Finally, it must not be presumed that the
mere fact that a witness received treatment or counselling after a sexual
assault indicates that the records will contain information that is relevant to
the defence.  The focus of therapy is vastly different from that of an
investigation or other process undertaken for the purposes of the trial.  While
investigations and witness testimony are oriented toward ascertaining
historical truth, therapy generally focuses on exploring the complainant's
emotional and psychological responses to certain events, after the alleged
assault has taken place.








If the trial judge decides that the records are likely
to be relevant, then the analysis proceeds to the second stage, which has two
parts.  First, the trial judge must balance the salutary and deleterious
effects of ordering the production of the records to the court for inspection,
having regard to the accused's right to make full answer and defence, and the
effect of such production on the privacy and equality rights of the subject of
the records.  If the judge concludes that production to the court is warranted,
he or she should so order.  Next, upon their production to the court, the judge
should examine the records to determine whether, and to what extent, they
should be produced to the accused.  Production should only be ordered in
respect of those records, or parts of records, that have significant probative
value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the
proper administration of justice or by the harm to the privacy rights of the
witness or to the privileged relation.  The following factors should be
considered in this determination:  (1) the extent to which the record is
necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence; (2) the
probative value of the record; (3) the nature and extent of the reasonable
expectation of privacy vested in the record; (4) whether production of the
record would be premised upon any discriminatory belief or bias; (5) the
potential prejudice to the complainant's dignity, privacy or security of the
person that would be occasioned by production of the record; (6) the
extent to which production of records of this nature would frustrate society's
interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences and the acquisition of
treatment by victims; and (7) the effect on the integrity of the trial
process of producing, or failing to produce, the record, having in mind the
need to maintain consideration in the outcome.  Where a court concludes that
production is warranted, it should only be made in the manner and to the extent
necessary to achieve that objective.

 








A preliminary inquiry judge is without jurisdiction to
order the production of private records held by third parties.  The disclosure
order in the present case did not emanate from a preliminary inquiry judge, but
was issued in response to a pre‑trial application by the defence.  Even a
superior court judge, however, should not, in advance of the trial, entertain
an application for production of private third party records.  Such
applications should be heard by the judge seized of the trial, rather than a
pre‑trial judge.  In addition, it is desirable for the judge hearing an
application for production to have had the benefit of hearing, and pronouncing
upon, the defence's earlier applications, so as to minimize the possibility of
inconsistency in the treatment of two similar applications.  More generally,
applications for production of third party records should not be entertained
before the commencement of the trial, even by the judge who is seized of the
trial.  First, the concept of pre‑trial applications for production of
documents held by third parties is alien to criminal proceedings.  Second, if
pre‑trial applications for production from third parties were permitted,
it would invite fishing expeditions, create unnecessary delays, and inconvenience
witnesses by requiring them to attend court on multiple occasions.  Moreover, a
judge is not in a position, before the beginning of the trial, to determine
whether the records in question are relevant, much less whether they are
admissible, and will be unable to balance effectively the constitutional rights
affected by a production order.

 

Since the right of the accused to a fair trial has not
been balanced with the competing rights of the complainant to privacy and to
equality without discrimination in this case, a new trial should be ordered.

 








Per McLachlin J.
(dissenting on this issue):  L'Heureux‑Dubé J.'s reasons were
concurred in entirely.  The test proposed strikes the appropriate balance
between the desire of the accused for complete disclosure from everyone of
everything that could conceivably be helpful to his defence, on the one hand,
and the constraints imposed by the trial process and privacy interests of third
parties who find themselves caught up in the justice system, on the other, all
without compromising the constitutional guarantee of a trial which is
fundamentally fair.  The Charter guarantees not the fairest of all
possible trials, but rather a trial which is fundamentally fair.  What
constitutes a fair trial takes into account not only the perspective of the
accused, but the practical limits of the system of justice and the lawful
interests of others involved in the process, like complainants and the agencies
which assist them in dealing with the trauma they may have suffered.  What the
law demands is not perfect justice, but fundamentally fair justice.

I. Introduction

 








1                 This
case, along with the companion decision in A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.), [1995]
4 S.C.R. 536, raises the issue of whether and under what circumstances an
accused is entitled to obtain production of sexual assault counselling
records in the possession of third parties.  It also raises the issue of when a
stay of proceedings is the appropriate remedy for non-disclosure by the Crown
of information in its possession which is neither clearly irrelevant nor
privileged.  On the latter issue, we agree with the reasons of Justice Major.

 

2                 As
for the issue of the production of therapeutic records, we have had the benefit
of reading the reasons of our colleague Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, and we are in
general agreement with her reasons on the issues of privacy and privilege.  We
wish, however, to make the following comments regarding the procedure to be
followed for the disclosure and production of therapeutic
records.

 

II. Analysis

 

1.  Introduction

 

3                 The
issues raised in the present appeal relate primarily to the production of
therapeutic records beyond the possession or the control of the Crown. 
Generally speaking, this issue concerns the manner in which the accused can
obtain production of therapeutic records from the third party custodian of the
documents in question.  Although issues relating to the disclosure of
private records in the possession of the Crown are not directly engaged in this
appeal, we nevertheless feel that some preliminary comments on that issue would
provide a useful background to a discussion of therapeutic records in the
possession of third parties.  As a result, we begin our analysis with a brief
consideration of the disclosure obligations of the Crown where therapeutic
counselling records are in the Crown's possession or control.  From there, we
will move on to consider the case where such records remain in the hands of
third parties and the production of those records is sought by the
accused.








2.  Records in the Possession of the Crown

 

(a)  The Application of Stinchcombe

 

4                 The
principles regarding the disclosure of information in the possession of the
Crown were developed by this Court in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
326.  In that case, it was determined that the Crown has an ethical and
constitutional obligation to the defence to disclose all information in its
possession or control, unless the information in question is clearly irrelevant
or protected by a recognized form of privilege.

 

5                 The
Crown's duty to disclose information in its possession is triggered when a
request for disclosure is made by the accused.  When such a request is made,
the Crown has a discretion to refuse to make disclosure on the grounds
that the information sought is clearly irrelevant or privileged.  Where the
Crown chooses to exercise this discretion, the Crown bears the burden of
satisfying the trial judge that withholding the information is justified on the
grounds of privilege or irrelevance.

 








6                 The
foregoing principles were settled by this Court's decision in Stinchcombe
and affirmed in R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, and R. v. Chaplin,
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 727, and are not subject to challenge in this appeal.  However,
it is important to consider whether therapeutic records of the kind at issue in
this appeal should be subject to a different disclosure regime than
other kinds of information in the possession of the Crown.  In answering this
question, the Court must consider whether the Crown's disclosure obligations
should be tempered by a balancing of the complainant's privacy interests in
therapeutic records against the right of the accused to make full answer and
defence.  In our view, a balancing of these competing interests is unnecessary
in the context of disclosure.

 

(b)  Privacy and Privilege

 

7                 As
our colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J. points out, sexual assault counselling records
relate to intimate aspects of the life of the complainant.  As a result,
therapeutic records attract a stronger privacy interest than many other forms
of information that may be in the Crown's possession.  One could accordingly
argue that the intensely private nature of therapeutic records affects the
Crown's obligation to disclose such material to the defence, or that disclosure
by the Crown is not required owing to some form of privilege that may attach to
the information contained in the records.  In our view, however, concerns
relating to privacy or privilege disappear where the documents in question have
fallen into the possession of the Crown.  We are accordingly of the opinion
that the Crown's well-established duty to disclose all information in its
possession is not affected by the confidential nature of therapeutic records.

 








8                 In
our view, it would be difficult to argue that the complainant enjoys an
expectation of privacy in records that are held by the Crown.  In discussing
the nature of a complainant's privacy interest in therapeutic records,
L'Heureux-Dubé J. points out that such records often relate to ""intensely
private aspects"" of the complainant's personal life, and describe thoughts
and feelings ""which have never even been shared with the closest of
friends or family"" (para. 112).  With respect, we agree that important
privacy interests attach to counselling records in the situation described by
our colleague.  However, where the documents in question have been shared with
an agent of the state (namely, the Crown), it is apparent that the
complainant's privacy interest in those records has disappeared.  Clearly,
where the records are in the possession of the Crown, they have become
""the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is
done"" (Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 333).  As a form of
""public property"", records in the possession of the Crown are simply
incapable of supporting any expectation of privacy.  As a result, there is no
""privacy interest"" to be balanced against the right of the accused to
make full answer and defence.

 

9                 The
complainant's lack of a privacy interest in records that are possessed by the
Crown counsels against a finding of privilege in such records.  As stated above,
it is somewhat inconsistent to claim that therapeutic records are sufficiently
confidential to warrant a claim of privilege even after this confidentiality
has been waived for the purpose of proceeding against the accused.  Obviously,
fairness must require that if the complainant is willing to release this
information in order to further the criminal prosecution, then the accused
should be entitled to use the information in the preparation of his or her
defence.

 








10               In
deciding that the complainant waives any potential claim of privilege where
therapeutic records are provided to the Crown, we recognize that any such
waiver must be ""fully informed"" in order to defeat an attempted claim
of privilege.  Clearly, one could make the argument that the complainant would
not have turned the documents over to the Crown had he or she been aware that
the accused could be given access to the records.  However, this problem is
easily solved by placing an onus upon the Crown to inform the complainant of
the potential for disclosure.  Where the Crown seeks to obtain the records in
question for the purpose of proceeding against the accused, the Crown must
explain to the complainant that the records, if relevant, will have to be
disclosed to the defence.  As a result, the complainant will be given the
opportunity to decide whether or not to waive any potential claim of privilege
prior to releasing the records in question to the agents of the state.

 

11               Finally,
it must be recognized that any form of privilege may be forced to yield where
such a privilege would preclude the accused's right to make full answer and
defence.  As this Court held in Stinchcombe (at p. 340), a trial judge
may require disclosure ""in spite of the law of privilege""
(emphasis added) where the recognition of the asserted privilege unduly limits
the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  As a result,
information in the possession of the Crown which is clearly relevant and
important to the ability of the accused to raise a defence must be
disclosed to the accused, regardless of any potential claim of privilege that
might arise.

 

(c)  Relevance

 

12               In
commenting on the nature of therapeutic records, L'Heureux-Dubé J. has made it
clear that the relevance of such records to the preparation of the defence
cannot be presumed.  As L'Heureux-Dubé J. states in her decision (at para.
144):

 

... it must not be presumed that the mere fact that a
witness received treatment or counselling after a sexual assault indicates that
the records will contain information that is relevant to the defence.  The
focus of therapy is vastly different from that of an investigation or other
process undertaken for the purposes of the trial.

 








With respect, we agree with the proposition that the mere existence
of therapeutic records is insufficient to establish the relevance of those
records to the defence.  However, we are of the opinion that the relevance of
such records must be presumed where the records are in the possession of
the Crown.  Generally speaking, the Crown would not obtain possession or
control of therapeutic records unless the information the records contained was
somehow relevant to the case against the accused.  While one could make the
argument that the Crown simply wished to peruse the records in question in
order to ensure that they contained no relevant information, this cannot affect
the Crown's obligation to disclose.  If indeed the Crown merely surveyed the
records and found them to contain no relevant material, the Crown would retain
the opportunity to prove the irrelevance of the records on a Stinchcombe
application by the defence.  Clearly, the Crown is in a better position than
the accused to discharge any onus regarding the relevance of the records, as
the Crown retains possession and control of the information.

 

(d)  Conclusion

 

13               For
each of the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the Crown's disclosure
obligations established in the Stinchcombe decision are unaffected by
the confidential nature of therapeutic records.  Where the Crown has possession
or control of therapeutic records, there is simply no compelling reason to
depart from the reasoning in Stinchcombe: unless the Crown can prove
that the records in question are clearly irrelevant or subject to some form of
public interest privilege, the therapeutic records must be disclosed to the
defence. 








14               Having
concluded that the principles of Stinchcombe are applicable in the
context of therapeutic records within the Crown's possession, it remains to be
determined what procedures for production will apply where the
counselling records in question are possessed by third parties.  Our views as
to the appropriate procedure in that situation are discussed below.

 

3. Records in the Hands of Third Parties

 

(a)  The Application of Stinchcombe

 

15               As
stated earlier, this Court's decision in Stinchcombe set out the general
principle that an accused's ability to access information necessary to make
full answer and defence is now constitutionally protected under s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The rationale for this constitutional
protection stems from the basic proposition that the right to make full answer
and defence is ""one of the pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily
depend to ensure that the innocent are not convicted"": Stinchcombe,
at p. 336.

 








16               Stinchcombe
and its progeny were decided in the context of disclosure, where the
information in question was in the possession of the Crown or the police. In
that context, we held that an accused was entitled to obtain all of the
information in the possession of the Crown, unless the information in question
was clearly irrelevant. However, Stinchcombe recognized that, even in
the context of disclosure, there are limits on the right of an accused to
access information. For example, when the Crown asserts that the information is
privileged, the trial judge must then balance the competing claims at issue. In
such cases, the information will only be disclosed where the trial judge
concludes that the asserted privilege ""does not constitute a reasonable
limit on the constitutional right to make full answer and defence"" (Stinchcombe,
at p. 340).

 

17               In
our opinion, the balancing approach we established in Stinchcombe can
apply with equal force in the context of production, where the
information sought is in the hands of a third party.  Of course, the balancing
process must be modified to fit the context in which it is applied.  In cases
involving production, for example, we are concerned with the competing claims
of a constitutional right to privacy in the information on the one hand, and
the right to full answer and defence on the other.  We agree with
L'Heureux-Dubé J. that a constitutional right to privacy extends to information
contained in many forms of third party records. 

 

18               In
recognizing that all individuals have a right to privacy which should be
protected as much as is reasonably possible, we should not lose sight of the
possibility of occasioning a miscarriage of justice by establishing a procedure
which unduly restricts an accused's ability to access information which may be
necessary for meaningful full answer and defence.  In R. v. Seaboyer,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 611, we recognized that:

 

Canadian courts ... have been extremely cautious in
restricting the power of the accused to call evidence in his or her defence, a
reluctance founded in the fundamental tenet of our judicial system that an
innocent person must not be convicted.

 

Indeed, so important is the societal interest in preventing a
miscarriage of justice that our law requires the state to disclose the identity
of an informer in certain circumstances, despite the fact that the revelation
may jeopardize the informer's safety.








(b) The First Stage: Establishing ""Likely
Relevance""

 

19               When
the defence seeks information in the hands of a third party (as compared to the
state), the following considerations operate so as to require a shifting of the
onus and a higher threshold of relevance:

 

(1)   the information is not part
of the state's ""case to meet"" nor has the state been granted access
to the information in preparing its case; and 

 

(2)   third parties have no
obligation to assist the defence.

 

In light of these considerations, we agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J.
that, at the first stage in the production procedure, the onus should be on the
accused to satisfy a judge that the information is likely to be relevant.
The onus we place on the accused should not be interpreted as an evidential
burden requiring evidence and a voir dire in every case. It is simply an
initial threshold to provide a basis for production which can be satisfied by
oral submissions of counsel. It is important to recognize that the accused will
be in a very poor position to call evidence given that he has never had access
to the records. Viva voce evidence and a voir dire may, however,
be required in situations in which the presiding judge cannot resolve the
matter on the basis of the submissions of counsel. (See Chaplin, supra,
at p. 744.)

 








20               In
order to initiate the production procedure, the accused must bring a formal
written application supported by an affidavit setting out the specific grounds
for production.   However, the court should be able, in the interests of
justice, to waive the need for a formal application in some cases.  In either
event, however, notice must be given to third parties in possession of the
documents as well as to those persons who have a privacy interest in the records. 
The accused must also ensure that the custodian and the records are subpoenaed
to ensure their attendance in the court.  The initial application for
disclosure should be made to the judge seized of the trial, but may be brought
before the trial judge prior to the empanelling of the jury, at the same time
that other motions are heard.  In this way, disruption of the jury will be
minimized and both the Crown and the defence will be provided with adequate
time to prepare their cases based on any evidence that may be produced as a
result of the application.

 

21               According
to L'Heureux-Dubé J., once the accused meets the ""likely relevance""
threshold, he or she must then satisfy the judge that the salutary effects of
ordering the documents produced to the court for inspection outweigh the
deleterious effects of such production.  We are of the view that this balancing
should be undertaken at the second stage of the procedure. The ""likely
relevance"" stage should be confined to a question of whether the right to
make full answer and defence is implicated by information contained in the
records. Moreover, a judge will only be in an informed position to engage in
the required balancing analysis once he or she has had an opportunity to review
the records in question.

 

(c) The Meaning of ""Likely"" Relevance

 








22               In
the disclosure context, the meaning of ""relevance"" is expressed in
terms of whether the information may be useful to the defence (see Egger,
supra, at p. 467, and Chaplin, supra, at p. 740). In the
context of production, the test of relevance should be higher: the presiding
judge must be satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility that the
information is logically probative to an issue at trial or the competence of
a witness to testify. When we speak of relevance to ""an issue at
trial"", we are referring not only to evidence that may be probative to the
material issues in the case (i.e. the unfolding of events) but also to evidence
relating to the credibility of witnesses and to the reliability of other
evidence in the case. See R. v. R. (L.) (1995), 39 C.R. (4th) 390 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 398. 

 

23               This
higher threshold of relevance is appropriate because it reflects the context in
which the information is being sought. Generally speaking, records in the hands
of third parties find their way into court proceedings by one of two
procedures. First, under s. 698(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , a party may apply for a subpoena requiring a person to attend where
that person is likely to give material evidence in a proceedings. Pursuant to
s. 700(1) of the Code, the subpoena is only available for those records
in the custodian's possession ""relating to the subject-matter of the
proceedings"".  The second method of obtaining production of documents is
to apply for a search warrant pursuant to s. 487(1) of the Code. Under
s. 487(1)(b) a search warrant will be issued where a justice is
satisfied that there is in a building, receptacle or place ""anything that
there are reasonable grounds to believe will afford evidence with respect to
the commission of an offence ..."". Consequently, under either of these
schemes the individual seeking access to third party records must satisfy a
neutral arbiter that the records are relevant to the proceedings in question.
We agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that the appropriate procedure to follow is via
the subpoena duces tecum route. 

 








24               While
we agree that ""likely relevance"" is the appropriate threshold for the
first stage of the two-step procedure, we wish to emphasize that, while this is
a significant burden, it should not be interpreted as an onerous burden upon
the accused.  There are several reasons for holding that the onus upon the
accused should be a low one.  First, at this stage of the inquiry, the only
issue is whether the information is ""likely"" relevant. We agree with
L'Heureux-Dubé J. that considerations of privacy should not enter into the
analysis at this stage. We should also not be concerned with whether the
evidence would be admissible, for example as a matter of policy, as that is a
different query  (Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190). As the
House of Lords recognized in R. v. Preston, [1993] 4 All E.R. 638, at p.
664:

 

... the fact that an item of information cannot be put
in evidence by a party does not mean that it is worthless. Often, the train of
inquiry which leads to the discovery of evidence which is admissible at a trial
may include an item which is not admissible....

 

A relevance threshold, at this stage, is simply a requirement to
prevent the defence from engaging in ""speculative, fanciful, disruptive,
unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming"" requests for production.
See Chaplin, supra, at p. 744.

 

25               Second,
by placing an onus on the accused to show ""likely relevance"", we put
the accused in the difficult situation of having to make submissions to the
judge without precisely knowing what is contained in the records. This Court
has recognized on a number of occasions the danger of placing the accused in a
""Catch-22"" situation as a condition of making full answer and defence
(see, for example, Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
1505, at pp. 1513-14; R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at pp.
1463-64; Carey v. Ontario, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637; and R. v. Durette,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 469). In Durette, at p. 499, Sopinka J., for a majority
of the Court, held:

 

The appellants should not be required to demonstrate
the specific use to which they might put information which they have not even
seen.








 

Similarly, La Forest J. in Carey, at p. 678, held in
commenting on the lower court's decision which denied the applicant access to
cabinet documents because his submissions, according to that court, were no
more than ""a bare unsupported assertion ... that something to help him may
be found"":

 

What troubles me about this
approach is that it puts on a plaintiff [the] burden of proving how the
documents, which are admittedly relevant, can be of assistance. How can he do
that? He has never seen them; they are confidential and so unavailable. To some
extent, then, what the documents contain must be a matter of speculation.

 

We are of the view that the concern expressed in these cases applies
with equal force in the case at bar, where the ultimate goal is the search for
truth rather than the suppression of potentially relevant evidence.

 








26               L'Heureux-Dubé
J. questions the ""Catch-22"" analogy in the context of production.  In
her view, there is no presumption of materiality because the records are not
created nor sought by the state as part of its investigation. However, it
should be remembered that in most cases, an accused will not be privy to the
existence of third party records which are maintained under strict rules of
confidentiality. Generally speaking, an accused will only become aware of the
existence of records because of something which arises in the course of the
criminal case. For example, the complainant's psychiatrist, therapist or social
worker may come forward and reveal his or her concerns about the complainant
(as occurred in R. v. Ross (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 253 (N.S.C.A.), and R.
v. Ross (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 234 (N.S.C.A.)). In other cases, the
complainant may reveal at the preliminary inquiry or in his or her statement to
the police that he or she decided to lay a criminal charge against the accused
following a visit with a particular therapist. There is a possibility of
materiality where there is a ""reasonably close temporal connection
between"" the creation of the records and the date of the alleged
commission of the offence (R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 673)
or in cases of historical events, as in this case, a close temporal connection
between the creation of the records and the decision to bring charges against
the accused. 

 

27               In
R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 370, we recognized that
""[i]t is difficult and arguably undesirable to lay down stringent rules
for the determination of the relevance of a particular category of
evidence"". Consequently, while we will not attempt to set out categories
of relevance, we feel compelled to respond to some of the statements expressed
by our colleague.  L'Heureux-Dubé J. suggests in her reasons that ""the
assumption that private therapeutic or counselling records are relevant to full
answer and defence is often highly questionable"" (para. 109) and that
""the vast majority of information noted during therapy sessions bears no
relevance whatsoever or, at its highest, only an attenuated sense of relevance
to the issues at trial"" (para. 144).  With respect, we disagree. L'Heureux-Dubé
J.'s observation as to the likelihood of relevance belies the reality that in
many criminal cases, trial judges have ordered the production of third party
records often applying the same principles we have enunciated in this case. The
sheer number of decisions in which such evidence has been produced supports the
potential relevance of therapeutic records.  

 








28               Moreover,
in Osolin, supra, this Court recognized the importance of
ensuring access to the kind of information at issue in this appeal. In Osolin,
we ordered a new trial where the accused had been denied an opportunity to
cross-examine regarding the psychiatric records of the complainant. Those
records contained the following entry (at p. 661):

 

She is concerned that her attitude and behaviour may
have influenced the man to some extent and is having second thoughts about the
entire case.

 

Cory J., for the majority, held, at p. 674, that:

 

...what the complainant said to her counsellor ... could
well reflect a victim's unfortunate and unwarranted feelings of guilt and shame
for actions and events that were in no way her fault. Feelings of guilt, shame
and lowered self-esteem are often the result of the trauma of a sexual assault.
If this is indeed the basis for her statement to the counsellor, then they
could not in any way lend an air of reality to the accused's proposed defence
of mistaken belief in the complainant's consent. However, in the absence of
cross-examination it is impossible to know what the result might have been.

 

29               By
way of illustration only, we are of the view that there are a number of ways in
which information contained in third party records may be relevant, for
example, in sexual assault cases:

 

 

(1)   they may contain
information concerning the unfolding of events underlying the criminal
complaint. See Osolin, supra, and R. v. R.S. (1985), 19
C.C.C. (3d) 115 (Ont. C.A.).

 








(2)   they may reveal the use of
a therapy which influenced the complainant's memory of the alleged events. For
example, in R. v. L. (D.O.), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, at p. 447,
L'Heureux-Dubé J. recognized the problem of contamination when she stated, in
the context of the sexual abuse of children, that ""the fear of
contaminating required testimony has forced the delay of needed therapy and
counselling"". See too R. v. Norman (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 153 (Ont.
C.A.).

 

(3)   they may contain
information that bears on the complainant's ""credibility, including
testimonial factors such as the quality of their perception of events at the
time of the offence, and their memory since"". See R. v. R. (L.), supra,
at p. 398; R. v. Hedstrom (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 261 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Ross (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 234 (N.S.C.A.); Toohey v. Metropolitan
Police Commissioner, [1965] 1 All. E.R. 506 (H.L.).

 

As a result, we disagree with L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s assertion that
therapeutic records will only be relevant to the defence in rare cases.

 

(d)   The Role of the Judge at
the Second Stage: Balancing Full Answer and Defence and Privacy

 

 








30               We
agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that ""upon their production to the court, the
judge should examine the records to determine whether, and to what extent, they
should be produced to the accused"" (para. 153).  We also agree that in making
that determination, the judge must examine and weigh the salutary and
deleterious effects of a production order and determine whether a
non-production order would constitute a reasonable limit on the ability of the
accused to make full answer and defence. In some cases, it may be possible for
the presiding judge to provide a judicial summary of the records to counsel to
enable them to assist in determining whether the material should be produced. 
This, of course, would depend on the specific facts of each particular case. 

 

31               We
also agree that, in balancing the competing rights in question, the following
factors should be considered: ""(1) the extent to which the record is
necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence; (2) the probative
value of the record in question; (3) the nature and extent of the reasonable
expectation of privacy vested in that record; (4) whether production of the
record would be premised upon any discriminatory belief or bias"" and
""(5) the potential prejudice to the complainant's dignity, privacy or
security of the person that would be occasioned by production of the record in
question"" (para. 156). 

 

32               However,
L'Heureux-Dubé J. also refers to two other factors that she believes must be
considered. She suggests that the judge should take account of ""the extent
to which production of records of this nature would frustrate society's
interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual offences and the acquisition of
treatment by victims"" as well as ""the effect on the integrity of the
trial process of producing, or failing to produce, the record, having in mind
the need to maintain consideration in the outcome"" (para. 156).  This last
factor is more appropriately dealt with at the admissibility stage and not in
deciding whether the information should be produced. As for society's interest
in the reporting of sexual crimes, we are of the opinion that there are other
avenues available to the judge to ensure that production does not frustrate the
societal interests that may be implicated by the production of the records to
the defence. A number of these avenues are discussed by the Nova Scotia Court
of Appeal in R. v. Ryan (1991), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 226, at p. 230:

 








As the trials of these two charges
proceed, there are a number of protective devices to allay the concerns of the
caseworkers over the contents of their files. The trial judge has considerable
discretion in these matters. It is for the trial judge to determine whether a
ban shall be placed on publication. It is for the trial judge to decide whether
spectators shall be barred when evidence is given on matters that the trial
judge deems to be extremely sensitive and worth excluding from the information
available to the public. High on the list is, of course, the matter of
relevance. Unless the evidence sought from the witness meets the test of
relevancy, it will be excluded. The trial judge is able to apply the
well-established rules and tests to determine whether any given piece of
evidence is relevant.

 

We are also of the view that these options are available to the
judge to further protect the privacy interests of witnesses if the production
of private records is ordered.  

 

33               Consequently,
the societal interest is not a paramount consideration in deciding whether the
information should be provided.  It is, however, a relevant factor which should
be taken into account in weighing the competing interests.

 

34               In
applying these factors, it is also appropriate to bear in mind that production
of third party records is always available to the Crown provided it can obtain
a search warrant.  It can do so if it satisfies a justice that there is in a
place, which includes a private dwelling, anything that there are reasonable
grounds to believe will afford evidence of the commission of an offence. 
Fairness requires that the accused be treated on an equal footing.

 

III. Conclusion and Disposition

 








35               Although
the parties have obviously failed to observe the above procedures for the
production of third party records, it is unnecessary to determine whether or
not a production order was warranted in this case.  In our view, Major J. is
correct in holding that the impropriety of the production order at issue in
this appeal ""does not excuse the conduct of the Crown after the order was
made"" (para. 222).  As a result, whether or not production was warranted
in this case, the conduct of the Crown in refusing to comply with the
production order is inexcusable, and warrants a stay of the proceedings against
the accused.  We are therefore in complete agreement with the reasoning and
conclusions of Major J., and would accordingly hold that this appeal should be
allowed.

 

The reasons of La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier
JJ. were delivered by

 

36               L'Heureux-Dubé J. -- Two issues are
raised by this appeal.  First, when does non-disclosure by the Crown justify an
order that the proceedings which are the subject matter of the non-disclosure
be stayed?  Second, what is the appropriate procedure to be followed when an
accused seeks production of documents such as medical and/or therapeutic
records that are in the hands of third parties?

 








37               Strictly
speaking, leave has only been sought to this Court from the decision of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. O'Connor (1994), 89 C.C.C.
(3d) 109, which addressed the question of the appropriateness of a stay. 
However, much of the non-disclosure and late disclosure that formed the basis
for the stay of proceedings that is the subject of this appeal related directly
to disagreement over the appropriateness of the pre-trial disclosure order made
by Campbell A.C.J.  As a result, those reasons must be read together as a whole
with R. v. O'Connor (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (""O'Connor (No.
2)""), in which the Court of Appeal provided guidelines for future
applications for production of medical records held by third parties.  Given
the national importance of establishing guidelines for such production (in
light of the absence of legislative intervention), and the fact that this
matter was fully argued before us, it is appropriate for this Court to provide
some assistance to lower courts in this respect.  Besides, the question is
squarely raised in another appeal which was heard by this Court and in which
judgment is rendered concurrently with this one:  A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.),
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 536.  As a preliminary matter, however, it is necessary to set
out the facts and judgments relevant to each of the two issues raised in this
case. 

 

I. Abuse of Process

 

A.  Facts and Judgments

 

38               The
appellant, Hubert Patrick O'Connor, is a Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church. 
In the 1960s, he was the principal of a native residential school in Williams
Lake.  As a result of incidents alleged to have taken place between 1964 and
1967 in the Williams Lake area, the appellant was charged in February 1991 with
two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault.  Each count arose in
relation to a separate complainant.  The four complainants, P.P, M.B., R.R.,
and A.S., were all former students employed by the school and under the direct
supervision of the appellant.

 








39               A
preliminary inquiry was held in Williams Lake on July 3 and 4, 1991, and, on
June 4, 1992, defence counsel applied for, and obtained, an order from Campbell
A.C.J. requiring disclosure of the complainants' entire medical, counselling
and school records.  Defence counsel justified its disclosure request on the
need to test the complainants' credibility, as well as to determine issues such
as recent complaint and corroboration.  The order reads as follows:

 

THIS COURT ORDERS that Crown
Counsel produce names, addresses and telephone numbers of therapists,
counsellors, psychologists or psychiatrists who have treated any of the
complainants with respect to allegations of sexual assault or sexual abuse.

 

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the
complainants authorize all therapists, counsellors, psychologists and
psychiatrists who have treated any of them with respect to allegations of
sexual assault or sexual abuse, to produce to the Crown copies of their
complete file contents and any other related material including all documents,
notes, records, reports, tape recordings and videotapes, and the Crown to
provide copies of all this material to counsel for the accused forthwith. 

 

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the
complainants authorize the Crown to obtain all school and employment records
while they were in attendance at St. Joseph's Mission School and that the Crown
provide those records to counsel for the accused forthwith.

 

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the
complainants authorize the production of all medical records from the period of
time when they were resident at St. Joseph's Mission School as either students
or employees.

 

At the time this order was made, the Crown did not have in its
possession any files of any persons who had treated any of the complainants in
relation to allegations of sexual assault or sexual abuse.  Nor, for that
matter, were submissions heard from, or was notice given to, any of the
complainants or guardians of the records sought by the defence.

 








40               On
July 10, 1992, the Crown applied before Low J. of the British Columbia Supreme
Court for directions regarding the disclosure order and for the early
appointment of a trial judge.  The court was informed that the complainants
were not prepared to comply with the order of Campbell A.C.J., as the Crown
wished to argue the point before the trial judge.  On September 21, 1992,
moreover, the Crown made an application before Oppal J. to change the venue of
the trial back to Williams Lake.  This application was dismissed.  In the
course of its submissions, the Crown noted that it intended to argue before the
trial judge that the therapists' notes subject to the disclosure order of
Campbell A.C.J. ought not to be disclosed on public policy grounds.  The court
expressed surprise at the fact that the order of Campbell A.C.J. was not being
complied with.

 

41               Thackray
J. was subsequently appointed the trial judge.  On October 16, 1992, the
appellant applied for a judicial stay of proceedings before Thackray J. on the
basis that pre-charge delay made it impossible to make full answer and
defence.  At the same time, the Crown sought directions from the trial judge
regarding the disclosure order of Campbell A.C.J.  By this time, however, many
of the impugned records had come into the Crown's possession.  The trial judge
made it clear that he was to be provided promptly with therapy records relating
to all four complainants.  Thackray J. was provided with the clinical notes of
Dr. Ingimundson, the psychologist treating P.P.  He reviewed these notes and
they were provided to defence counsel.  Crown counsel further informed the
court that the therapist for M.B. had been instructed to forward all records to
the Crown.  On October 22, 1992, Thackray J. released written reasons
dismissing the appellant's application for a stay of proceedings. 

 








42               On
October 30, 1992, the appellant applied by way of writ of  certiorari to
quash the committal of the appellant to stand trial on one count of the
indictment.  On November 5, 1992, the trial judge released written reasons
dismissing the appellant's application.  During the course of those
proceedings, however, the Crown produced the notes of M.B.'s therapist, Dr.
Cheaney, to the court for review.  The Crown requested, however, that the court
not release the records to the defence before hearing an application on that
point from Crown counsel Wendy Harvey.  The trial judge assented to this
request.

 

43               On
November 19, 1992, the appellant applied pursuant to s. 581  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , for an order that the indictment be declared
void ab initio for failure to provide sufficient detail.  This
application was dismissed by Thackray J. in reasons filed November 24, 1992. 
The appellant also once again raised the issue of the non-disclosure of the
medical records of M.B.  The Crown opposed the disclosure of the records on the
ground that they were not relevant, but Thackray J. ordered that they be
disclosed to the defence forthwith.  Appellant's counsel also requested
disclosure of the diary of the complainant R.R., for which it had already been
provided with a synopsis.  The trial judge took possession of the diary for
review and expressed concern that the Crown was taking so long to comply with
the order of Campbell A.C.J., given that the trial was scheduled to commence in
10 days.   

 

44               On
November 26, 1992, the appellant made another application for a judicial stay
of proceedings based on non-disclosure of several items, including the
following: the medical records of the complainants, the transcript of an
interview between Crown counsel and the complainant M.B., the transcript of an
interview between Crown counsel and witness M.O. containing statements
contradictory to testimony given by the complainant M.B. and corroborative of
the evidence of the appellant, and the diary of the complainant R.R. 

 








45                
In the course of submissions during this application, Crown counsel Wendy
Harvey submitted that the two Crown counsel, herself and Mr. Greg Jones, were
handling the prosecution from different cities, and that there were
difficulties concerning communication and organization.  She asserted that the
non-disclosure of some of the medical records was due to inadvertence on her
part, and that she had ""dreamt"" the transcripts of the interviews
with M.B. and M.O. had been disclosed.  Ms. Harvey submitted that uninhibited
disclosure of medical and therapeutic records would revictimize the victims,
and suggested that the order of Campbell A.C.J., and the request of defence
counsel for disclosure of the therapy records of the complainants, exhibited
gender bias. 

 








46               In
oral reasons delivered Friday, November 27, 1992, Thackray J. dismissed the
application for a judicial stay, finding that the failure to disclose the
records of Dr. Hume, R.R.'s physician, had been an oversight.  He further found
that M.O.'s evidence had been known to the defence for some time and that no
prejudice to the accused had been demonstrated by its non-disclosure.  He
declined to disclose the complete diaries of the complainant R.R. on the basis
that the summaries provided to the defence, as well as the excerpts already in
their possession, were sufficient.  He noted, however, that the letters written
by Ms. Harvey to the counsellors had unacceptably limited the scope of the
disclosure to only those portions of the records which related directly to the
incidents involving the accused.  This resulted in the full therapy records not
being disclosed to the defence until after November 26.  He concluded that
while the conduct of the Crown was ""disturbing"", he did not believe
that there was a ""grand design"" to conceal evidence, nor any
""deliberate plan to subvert justice"".  He was not convinced that the
Crown's conduct would lead the public to hold the system of justice in
disrepute.  While dismissing the application for a judicial stay of
proceedings, Thackray J. condemned in no uncertain terms Ms. Harvey's inability
to distinguish ""between her personal objectives and her professional
responsibilities"".

 

47               Over
the weekend of November 28, in light of the difficulties encountered during
discovery, Crown counsel agreed to waive any privilege with respect to the
contents of the Crown's file and to prepare a binder in relation to each of the
complainants containing all information in the Crown's possession relating to each
of them.  This agreement contemplated giving the defence copies of documents
which would not ordinarily be disclosed, including Crown counsel's personal
notes and work product, some of which were on computer.  At the pre-trial
conference held that Monday, Ms. Harvey informed the trial judge that
appellant's counsel were now in possession of all the notes that she had
prepared in connection with the case. 

 








48               The
trial began on Wednesday, December 2, 1992.  The Crown's first witness was Dr.
Van Dyke, a socio-cultural anthropologist.  Its second witness was Margaret
Gilbert, a former student at St. Joseph's Mission School.  Her evidence dealt
primarily with the layout of the school.  On the second day of the trial, the
Crown called the complainant P.P.  In the course of direct examination, the
Crown sought to have the witness give her evidence by drawing.  Appellant's
counsel objected.  Discussions revealed that the witness had, during the course
of witness preparation that weekend, made a drawing of this nature for Crown
counsel that had not been disclosed to defence counsel.  That drawing was
obtained from the Crown office and the appellant took the position that it
represented a materially different version of this complainant's allegations. 
The Crown disagreed with that assessment.  The trial judge refused to allow the
witness to testify through the use of drawings.  At the end of the day, the
Crown had not yet completely finished its examination-in-chief of this witness.

 

49               When
the trial resumed the following day, appellant's counsel informed the court
that, at the conclusion of the previous day's proceedings, the Crown had
provided the appellant with another eight sets of drawings prepared by the
various complainants in the presence of Crown counsel.  Crown counsel Wendy
Harvey was not present in court, and no explanation was given for her absence. 
Court was adjourned for one hour.  When the trial resumed, Ms. Harvey was still
not present.  Appellant's counsel made another application for a judicial stay
of proceedings based largely on the fact that the senior prosecutor, Mr. Jones,
was still unable to guarantee to the appellant that full disclosure had been
made.  Over the objection of appellant's counsel, the trial judge granted Mr.
Jones' request for a further adjournment until the afternoon session.

 








50               When
court resumed that afternoon, Wendy Harvey was present. The Crown submission,
however, was put forward by Mr. Jones.  He acknowledged that the binders which
had been provided to appellant's counsel as a result of the agreement reached
over the weekend of November 28 were not complete, and that the staff had omitted
to download Ms. Harvey's computer files.  One of the undisclosed documents was
the complete version of a Crown interview with P.P. which had been partially
disclosed to the defence on November 25.  After reviewing some of the
undisclosed notes, the Crown indicated that it did not believe that the notes
revealed anything ""new"".  Mr. Jones then indicated to the court that
Ms. Harvey's complete computer files were in the process of being downloaded
but that, in light of what had just happened, he could not guarantee that
everything had been appropriately disclosed to the appellant at that time.  He
took the position, however, that the undisclosed notes contained nothing
material, and encouraged the trial judge to engage in an inquiry of their
materiality.  These statements applied to all four counts on the indictment. 
Thackray J. indicated that he would give judgment on December 7 on defence
counsel's motion for a stay.  Although he indicated he would give counsel the
opportunity to make further submissions if any other developments occurred, no
further submissions were made by either side.

 

51               On
December 7, 1992, Thackray J. handed down a judicial stay of proceedings on all
four counts:  (1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 98.  He distinguished this application from
previous applications for a stay of proceedings on the basis that the trial was
now under way and witnesses had already been called by the Crown and
cross-examined by the defence.  Thackray J. found that had the diagrams of the
complainant P.P. been disclosed prior to testimony, they might have affected
the preparation of the case by the defence.  While P.P. had not yet been
cross-examined, Thackray J. found it unacceptable that defence counsel was put
in the position of preparing the cross-examination without all the relevant
documents.  He therefore concluded that the accused had suffered prejudice,
although he conceded that the extent of this prejudice could not be measured. 
He noted the constant intervention required by the court to ensure full
compliance with the order of Campbell A.C.J. and found that the Crown's earlier
conduct had created ""an aura"" that had pervaded and ultimately
destroyed the case.  In his view, this was now ""one of the clearest of
cases"", and to allow the case to proceed would tarnish the integrity of
the court. 

 








52               The
British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and directed a new
trial:  (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 109, 42 B.C.A.C. 105, 67 W.A.C. 105, 20 C.R.R.
(2d) 212, 29 C.R. (4th) 40.  It reviewed the case law on abuse of process and
concluded that there was no settled view on whether the common law doctrine had
or had not been subsumed within s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .  It noted, however, that the focus of the common law doctrine of
abuse of process had historically been on maintaining the integrity of the
court's process whereas the focus of the Charter was on the rights of
the individual.  It also noted the seemingly different standards of proof and
remedies under the two regimes.  It therefore concluded that the common law
doctrine of abuse of process continued to exist independently of s. 7  of the Charter ,
although there may be significant overlap between the two.

 

53               After
noting that some ambiguity remained as to the required elements of abuse of
process, the Court of Appeal concluded that in order to establish an abuse of
process, as opposed to a ""mere"" violation of a Charter right,
an accused must demonstrate conduct on the part of the Crown that is so
oppressive, vexatious or unfair as to contravene our fundamental notions of
justice and thus to undermine the integrity of our judicial process.  It
further noted that the discretion to order a stay may be exercised only in the
""clearest of cases"", meaning that the trial judge must be convinced
that, if allowed to continue, the proceedings would tarnish the integrity of
the judicial process. 

 








54               The
court then turned to the scope and extent of the Crown's obligation to disclose
information, as set out in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.  It
concluded that the right of an accused to full disclosure by the Crown is an
adjunct of the right to make full answer and defence and that disclosure is
not, itself, a constitutionally protected right.  As such, a simple
non-disclosure, in and of itself, would not necessarily constitute a Charter
violation.  A Charter violation would only be made out when the accused
demonstrated that a document which should have been disclosed (i.e. there was a
reasonable possibility that it could assist in making full answer and defence)
had on a balance of probabilities prejudiced or had an adverse effect on the
accused's ability to make full answer and defence.  In some circumstances, the
only appropriate remedy for such non-disclosure might be a stay of
proceedings.  The Court of Appeal further held that a material non-disclosure,
without more, could never amount to a common law abuse of process.  In its
view, only when non-disclosure was motivated by an intention on the part of the
Crown to deprive the accused of a fair trial could an abuse of process arise.

 

55               Applying
these principles to the case at bar, the Court of Appeal concluded that the
trial judge erred in failing to inquire into the materiality of the
non-disclosed information before ordering the stay of proceedings.  As such, it
could not be said that a violation of the accused's s. 7  rights had occurred,
nor that the conduct of the Crown amounted to an abuse of process.  

 








56               The
court noted that the trial judge had felt that a stay was necessary because of
the ""aura"" which had been created by the earlier non-disclosures in
respect of the order of Campbell A.C.J.  It noted that the trial judge had
found (in the judgment of November 27) that there was no ""grand
design"" in this non-disclosure to subvert the fair trial rights of the
accused.  It also noted that the Crown had tried to rectify the earlier
disclosure problems by waiving all privilege and giving the defence the entire contents
of their file.  The court thus concluded that there was no evidence that the
Crown's inept handling of the case was motivated by an intention to deprive the
accused of a fair trial.  As such, the trial judge had erred in entering a stay
of proceedings on the basis of the common law abuse of process.

 

57               The
court then commented briefly on the question of whether an alternative remedy
would have been available under the Charter.  It concluded that since no
determination as to the materiality of the records was made, a stay could not
be sustained under s. 24(1) .  Since it did not appear that any permanent or
irremediable damage had been done to the accused's ability to make full answer
and defence as a result of any non-disclosures or late disclosures that were in
fact material, the accused's rights could have been protected by an
adjournment, by recalling witnesses who had already testified, or by declaring
a mistrial if those would not suffice. 

 

B.  Analysis of Abuse of Process

 

58               I
agree with the Court of Appeal that it would be pointless to order a new trial
on the basis that there was no abuse of process if a stay ought nevertheless to
have prevailed under ss. 7  and 24(1)  of the Charter .  It is therefore
necessary to clarify the relationship between the common law and the Charter
in this respect, both in order to dispose effectively of the question raised in
this case and to provide guidance to courts facing similar situations involving
non-disclosure in the future.

 

(i)    The Relationship
Between Abuse of Process and the Charter

 

59               The
modern resurgence of the common law doctrine of abuse of process began with the
judgment of this Court in R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128. In Jewitt,
the Court set down what has since become the standard formulation of the test,
at pp. 136-37:








 

Lord Devlin has expressed the
rationale supporting the existence of a judicial discretion to enter a stay of
proceedings to control prosecutorial behaviour prejudicial to accused persons
in Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254 (H.L.)
at p. 1354:

 

Are the courts to rely on the Executive to protect
their process from abuse?  Have they not themselves an inescapable duty to
secure fair treatment for those who come or who are brought before them?  To
questions of this sort there is only one possible answer.  The courts cannot
contemplate for a moment the transference to the Executive of the
responsibility for seeing that the process of law is not abused.

 

I would adopt the conclusion of
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Young, supra, and affirm that
""there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay
proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those
fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair
play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through
oppressive and vexatious proceedings"".  I would also adopt the caveat
added by the Court in Young that this is a power which can be exercised
only in the ""clearest of cases"". [Emphasis added.]

 

The general test for abuse of process adopted in that case has been
repeatedly affirmed:  R. v. Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at pp.
658-59, R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 941, R. v. Conway,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667, R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at
pp. 992-93, and most recently in R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at
pp. 612-15.  

 

60               After
considering much of this case law, the Court of Appeal concluded that the
preponderance of cases favoured maintaining a distinction between the Charter
and the common law doctrine of abuse of process.  The Court of Appeal may, in
my view, have underestimated the extent to which both individual rights to
trial fairness and the general reputation of the criminal justice system are
fundamental concerns underlying both the common law doctrine of abuse of
process and the Charter.  This, for the following reasons.

 








61               First,
while the Charter is certainly concerned with the rights of the
individual, it is also concerned with preserving the integrity of the judicial
system.  Subsection 24(2)  of the Charter  gives express recognition to
this dual role.  More significantly, however, this Court has, on many
occasions, noted that the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7  are, in
large part, inspired by, and premised upon, values that are fundamental to our
common law.  In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p.
503, Lamer J. (as he then was) observed:

 

...the principles of fundamental justice are to be
found in the basis tenets of our legal system.  They do not lie in the realm
of general public policy but in the inherent domain of the judiciary as
guardian of the justice system.  Such an approach to the interpretation of
""principles of fundamental justice"" is consistent with the wording
and structure of s. 7 , the context of the section, i.e., ss. 8  to 14 ,
and the character and larger objects of the Charter itself.  It provides
meaningful content for the s. 7  guarantee all the while avoiding adjudication
of policy matters.  [Emphasis added.]

 

See also R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 406; Dagenais
v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at p. 929 (per
Gonthier J., dissenting on other grounds).  The common law doctrine of abuse of
process is part and parcel of those fundamental values.  It is, therefore, not
surprising that in R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 915 (per
Sopinka J.), the majority of this Court recognized that the court's power to
remedy abuses of its process now has constitutional status.

 








62               Conversely,
it is equally clear that abuse of process also contemplates important
individual interests.  In ""The Stay of Proceedings as a Remedy in Criminal
Cases: Abusing the Abuse of Process Concept"" (1991), 15 Crim. L.J.
315, at p. 331, Professor Paciocco suggests that the doctrine of abuse of
process, in addition to preserving the reputation of the administration of
justice, also seeks to ensure that accused persons are given a fair trial. 
Arguably, the latter is essentially a subset of the former.  Unfair trials will
almost inevitably cause the administration of justice to fall into disrepute: R.
v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265; R. v. Elshaw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 24. 
See also A. L.-T. Choo, ""Halting Criminal Prosecutions:  The Abuse of
Process Doctrine Revisited"", [1995] Crim. L.R. 864, at p. 865. 
What is significant for our purposes, however, is the fact that one often
cannot separate the public interests in the integrity of the system from the
private interests of the individual accused.  

 

63               In
fact, it may be wholly unrealistic to treat the latter as wholly distinct from
the former.  This Court has repeatedly recognized that human dignity is at the
heart of the Charter.  While respect for human dignity and autonomy may
not necessarily, itself, be a principle of fundamental justice (Rodriguez v.
British Columbia (Attorney General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at p. 592, per
Sopinka J. for the majority), it seems to me that conducting a prosecution in a
manner that contravenes the community's basic sense of decency and fair play
and thereby calls into question the integrity of the system is also an affront
of constitutional magnitude to the rights of the individual accused.  It would
violate the principles of fundamental justice to be deprived of one's liberty
under circumstances which amount to an abuse of process and, in my view, the
individual who is the subject of such treatment is entitled to present
arguments under the Charter and to request a just and appropriate remedy
from a court of competent jurisdiction.

 








64               The
overlap between prejudice to the individual and prejudice to the system was
noted, for instance, in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p.
947, where Lamer J. stated that, in certain cases, a Charter stay might
be appropriate to remedy a violation of s. 11 (b) even where there was no
demonstrated prejudice to the fairness of the trial.  More recently, in R.
v. Morin, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, at p. 786 (per Sopinka J.), and p.
812 (per McLachlin J.) this Court recognized that, although the primary
purpose of s. 11 (b) is the protection of the individual rights of the
accused, there is also a secondary interest of society as a whole in the
prompt, humane, and fair trial of those accused of crimes.  Equally apposite
are the remarks of Wilson J. in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney
General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at p. 1354, who noted that a contextually
sensitive approach to Charter rights requires that the private interests
reflected therein also be evaluated from the standpoint of the public interests
that underlie those private rights.  Given that many, if not most, of the
individual rights protected in the Charter also have a broader, societal
dimension, it is therefore consistent with both the purpose and the spirit of
the Charter to look, in certain cases, beyond the possibility of
prejudice to the particular accused, to clear cases of prejudice to the
integrity of the judicial system.  

 

65               For
this reason, the principles of fundamental justice, including the
""fairness of the trial"", necessarily reflect a balancing of societal
and individual interests: Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at p. 539 (per La Forest J.); R. v. E. (A.W.),
[1993] 3 S.C.R. 155, at p. 198 (per Cory J.); Cunningham v. Canada,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 143; R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475, at p. 486. 
As such, they reflect both individual and societal interests.  In my view, it
is undisputable that the preservation of the integrity of the judicial system
is one of these interests.

 








66               Second,
I would note the beginnings of a strong trend toward convergence between the Charter
and traditional abuse of process doctrine.  In R. v. Xenos (1991), 70
C.C.C. (3d) 362 (Que. C.A.), for instance, the accused had been charged with
arson and attempting to defraud an insurance company.  It emerged in
cross-examination that the Crown's key witness had arranged with the insurers
to be paid $50,000 by the insurers if the accused was convicted.  The trial
judge found an abuse of process, but declined to order a stay.  Rather, in
convicting the accused, he said that he had ignored this evidence.  The Court
of Appeal agreed in principle with the trial judge that a stay was not the only
remedy for an abuse of process and went on to rule that the appropriate remedy
was in fact to exclude the witness's testimony in a new trial before a
different judge.  This case is an excellent example, in my mind, of how courts
are becoming increasingly bold and innovative in finding appropriate remedies
in lieu of stays for abuses of process.  Professor Stuesser points out in
""Abuse of Process: The Need to Reconsider"" (1994), 29 C.R. (4th) 92,
at p. 99, moreover, that the common law in the United Kingdom and Australia
urges judges to look at lesser remedies before entering stays of proceedings. 
He argues that these authorities support the view that even under the common
law, the remedy for abuse of process is no longer only a stay of proceedings. 

 








67               I
recognize that this Court has consistently, albeit implicitly, considered abuse
of process separately from the Charter.  In Conway, supra,
it considered abuse of process separately from the s. 11 (b)
considerations arising from the accused facing a third trial.  In Scott,
supra, in the context of an immediate stay by the Crown upon the posing
by defence counsel of a question which would have revealed the identity of a
police informer, the majority again considered abuse of process separately from
an examination of whether the accused's s. 11 (b) rights had been
violated by the Crown's subsequent reinitiation of the proceedings.  Finally,
in Power, supra, it found no abuse of process in the Crown's
failure to call further evidence after the trial judge had excluded a key
breathalyzer sample and did not address the possibility of a Charter
violation at all.  In my view, however, the issues addressed in each of these
three cases could have been addressed equally effectively under the Charter. 
In none of these decisions did the majority of this Court actively turn its
mind to the interaction between the Charter and the common law doctrine
of abuse of process.  On the only occasion that it did, moreover, it expressly
declined to address the issue: Keyowski, supra, at pp. 660-61. 
On the other hand, in Mack, supra, this Court commented at pp.
939-40 and again at p. 976 upon the strong parallels that exist between the two
regimes. 

 

68               I
also recognize that, despite these strong parallels, the common law and Charter
analyses have often been kept separate because of the differing onus of proof
upon the accused under the two regimes.  In R. v. Keyowski (1986), 28
C.C.C. (3d) 553 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 561-62, for instance, it was noted that
while the burden of proof under the Charter was the balance of
probabilities, the burden under the common law was the ""clearest of cases"". 
It is important to remember, however, that even if a violation of s. 7  is
proved on a balance of probabilities, the court must still determine what
remedy is just and appropriate under s. 24(1) .  The power granted in s. 24(1) 
is in terms discretionary, and it is by no means automatic that a stay of
proceedings should be granted for a violation of s. 7 .  On the contrary, I
would think that the remedy of a judicial stay of proceedings would be
appropriate under s. 24(1)  only in the clearest of cases.  In this way, the
threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings remains, under the Charter
as under the common law doctrine of abuse of process, the ""clearest of
cases"".








69               Remedies
less drastic than a stay of proceedings are of course available under s. 24(1) 
in situations where the ""clearest of cases"" threshold is not met but
where it is proved, on a balance of probabilities, that s. 7  has been
violated.  In this respect the Charter regime is more flexible than the
common law doctrine of abuse of process.  However, this is not a reason to
retain a separate common law regime.   It is important to recognize that the Charter
has now put into judges' hands a scalpel instead of an axe -- a tool that may
fashion, more carefully than ever, solutions taking into account the sometimes
complementary and sometimes opposing concerns of fairness to the individual,
societal interests, and the integrity of the judicial system.  Even at common
law, courts have given consideration to the societal (not to mention
individual) interests in obtaining a final adjudication of guilt or innocence
in cases involving serious offences.  In Conway, supra, at p.
1667, for instance, I elaborated upon the essential balancing character of
abuse of process in the following terms:

 

[Abuse of process] acknowledges that courts must have
the respect and support of the community in order that the administration of
criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the
affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest
in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of
justice is best served by staying the proceedings.  [Emphasis added.]

 

I see no reason why such balancing cannot be performed equally, if
not more, effectively under the Charter, both in terms of defining
violations and in terms of selecting the appropriate remedy to perceived
violations.  See, by analogy, Morin, supra.  

 








70               For
these reasons, I conclude that the only instances in which there may be a need
to maintain any type of distinction between the two regimes will be those
instances in which the Charter, for some reason, does not apply yet
where the circumstances nevertheless point to an abuse of the court's process. 
Because the question is not before us, however, I leave for another day any
discussion of when such situations, if they indeed exist, may arise.  As a general
rule, however, there is no utility in maintaining two distinct approaches to
abusive conduct.  The distinction is one that only lawyers could possibly find
significant.  More importantly, maintaining this somewhat artificial dichotomy
may, over time, create considerably more confusion than it resolves.

 

71               The
principles of fundamental justice both reflect and accommodate the nature of
the common law doctrine of abuse of process.  Although I am willing to concede
that the focus of the common law doctrine of abuse of process has traditionally
been more on the protection of the integrity of the judicial system whereas the
focus of the Charter has traditionally been more on the protection of
individual rights, I believe that the overlap between the two has now become so
significant that there is no real utility in maintaining two distinct analytic
regimes.  We should not invite schizophrenia into the law.

 

72               I
therefore propose to set down some guidelines for evaluating, first, whether
there has been a violation of the Charter that invokes concerns
analogous to those traditionally raised under the doctrine of abuse of process
and, second, the circumstances under which the remedy of a judicial stay of
proceedings will be ""appropriate and just"", as required by s. 24(1) 
of the Charter .

 

(ii)   Section 7 , Abuse of
Process and Non-disclosure

 








73               As
I have already noted, the common law doctrine of abuse of process has found
application in a variety of different circumstances involving state conduct
touching upon the integrity of the judicial system and the fairness of the
individual accused's trial.  For this reason, I do not think that it is helpful
to speak of there being any one particular ""right against abuse of
process"" within the Charter.  Depending on the circumstances,
different Charter guarantees may be engaged.  For instance, where the
accused claims that the Crown's conduct has prejudiced his ability to have a
trial within a reasonable time, abuses may be best addressed by reference to s.
11 (b) of the Charter , to which the jurisprudence of this Court
has now established fairly clear guidelines (Morin, supra). 
Alternatively, the circumstances may indicate an infringement of the accused's
right to a fair trial, embodied in ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
In both of these situations, concern for the individual rights of the accused
may be accompanied by concerns about the integrity of the judicial system.  In
addition, there is a residual category of conduct caught by s. 7  of the Charter . 
This residual category does not relate to conduct affecting the fairness of the
trial or impairing other procedural rights enumerated in the Charter,
but instead addresses the panoply of diverse and sometimes unforeseeable
circumstances in which a prosecution is conducted in such a manner as to
connote unfairness or vexatiousness of such a degree that it contravenes
fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the
judicial process.

 

74               Non-disclosure
by the Crown normally falls within the second category described above. 
Consequently, a challenge based on non-disclosure will generally require a
showing of actual prejudice to the accused's ability to make full answer and
defence.  In this connection, I am in full agreement with the Court of Appeal
that there is no autonomous ""right"" to disclosure in the Charter
(at pp. 148-49 C.C.C.):








...the right of an accused to full disclosure by the
Crown is an adjunct of the right to make full answer and defence.  It is not
itself a constitutionally protected right.  What this means is that while the Crown
has an obligation to disclose, and the accused has a right to all that which
the Crown is obligated to disclose, a simple breach of the accused's right to
such disclosure does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of the
Charter such as to entitle a remedy under s. 24(1) .  This flows from the fact
that the non-disclosure of information which ought to have been
disclosed because it was relevant, in the sense there was a reasonable
possibility it could assist the accused in making full answer and defence,
will not amount to a violation of the accused's s. 7  right not to be deprived
of liberty except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice unless
the accused establishes that the non-disclosure has probably prejudiced
or had an adverse effect on his or her ability to make full answer and defence.

 

It is the distinction between
the ""reasonable possibility"" of impairment of the right to make full
answer and defence and the ""probable"" impairment of that right which
marks the difference between a mere breach of the right to relevant disclosure
on the one hand and a constitutionally material non-disclosure on the other.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]

 

Where the accused seeks to establish that the non-disclosure by the
Crown violates s. 7  of the Charter , he or she must establish that the
impugned non-disclosure has, on the balance of probabilities, prejudiced or had
an adverse effect on his or her ability to make full answer and defence.  It
goes without saying that such a determination requires reasonable inquiry into
the materiality of the non-disclosed information.  Where the information is
found to be immaterial to the accused's ability to make full answer and
defence, there cannot possibly be a violation of the Charter in this
respect.  I would note, moreover, that inferences or conclusions about the
propriety of the Crown's conduct or intention are not necessarily relevant to
whether or not the accused's right to a fair trial is infringed.  The focus
must be primarily on the effect of the impugned actions on the fairness
of the accused's trial.  Once a violation is made out, a just and appropriate
remedy must be found.

 

(iii)  The Appropriate Remedy
to a s. 7  Violation for Non-disclosure








75               Where
there has been a violation of a right under the Charter, s. 24(1) 
confers upon a court of competent jurisdiction the power to confer ""such
remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances"". 
Professor Paciocco, supra, at p. 341, has recommended that a stay of
proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria are fulfilled:

 

(1)   the prejudice caused by the
abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the
conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and

 

(2)   no other remedy is
reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.

 

I adopt these guidelines, and note that they apply equally with
respect to prejudice to the accused or to the integrity of the judicial system.

 

76               As
I have stated, non-disclosure will generally violate s. 7  only if it impairs
the accused's right to full answer and defence.  Although it is not a
precondition to a disclosure order that there be a Charter violation, a
disclosure order can be a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . 
Thus, where the adverse impact upon the accused's ability to make full answer
and defence is curable by a disclosure order, then such a remedy, combined with
an adjournment where necessary to enable defence counsel to review the
disclosed information, will generally be appropriate.

 








77               There
may, however, be exceptional situations where, given the advanced state of the
proceedings, it is simply not possible to remedy through reasonable means the
prejudice to the accused's right to make full answer and defence.  In such
cases, the drastic remedy of a stay of proceedings may be necessary.  Although
I will return to this matter in my discussion on the disclosure of records held
by third parties, we must recall that, under certain circumstances, the defence
will be unable to lay the foundation for disclosure of a certain item until the
trial has actually begun and witnesses have already been called.  In those
instances, it may be necessary to take measures such as permitting the defence
to recall certain witnesses for examination or cross-examination, adjournments
to permit the defence to subpoena additional witnesses or even, in extreme
circumstances, declaring a mistrial.  A stay of proceedings is a last resort,
to be taken when all other acceptable avenues of protecting the accused's right
to full answer and defence are exhausted.

 

78               When
choosing a remedy for a non-disclosure that has violated s. 7 , the court should
also consider whether the Crown's breach of its disclosure obligations has also
violated fundamental principles underlying the community's sense of decency and
fair play and thereby caused prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system. 
If so, it should be asked whether this prejudice is remediable.  Consideration
must be given to the seriousness of the violation and to the societal and
individual interests in obtaining a determination of guilt or innocence. 
Although some of the most salient considerations are discussed immediately
below, that discussion is by no means exhaustive.

 








79               Among
the most relevant considerations are the conduct and intention of the Crown. 
For instance, non-disclosure due to a refusal to comply with a court order will
be regarded more seriously than non-disclosure attributable to inefficiency or
oversight.  It must be noted, however, that while a finding of flagrant and
intentional Crown misconduct may make it significantly more likely that a stay
of proceedings will be warranted, it does not follow that a demonstration of mala
fides on the part of the Crown is a necessary precondition to such a
finding.  As Wilson J. observed for the Court in Keyowski, supra, at p.
659:

 

To define ""oppressive"" as requiring
misconduct or an improper motive would, in my view, unduly restrict the
operation of the doctrine....  Prosecutorial misconduct and improper motivation
are but two of many factors to be taken into account when a court is called
upon to consider whether or not in a particular case the Crown's [conduct]
amounts to an abuse of process.

 

 80              Another
pertinent consideration will be the number and nature of adjournments attributable
to the Crown's conduct, including adjournments attributable to its failure to
disclose in a timely manner.  Every adjournment and/or additional hearing
caused by the Crown's breach of its obligation to disclose may have physical,
psychological and economic consequences upon the accused, particularly if the
accused is incarcerated pending trial.  In all fairness, however, the Crown may
also seek to establish by evidence that the accused is in the majority group of
persons who benefit from a delay in the proceedings because they do not want an
early trial:  Morin, supra, at pp. 802-3.

 








81               Finally,
in determining whether the prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system is
remediable, consideration must be given to the societal and individual
interests in obtaining a determination of guilt or innocence.  It goes without
saying that these interests will increase commensurately to the seriousness of
the charges against the accused.  Consideration should be given to less drastic
remedies than a stay of proceedings (see for example R. v. Burlingham,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, where, although I agreed with the majority that the
Crown's conduct in disregarding the plea bargain made with the accused did not
amount to one of the ""clearest of cases"" requiring a stay of
proceedings, I would have nonetheless found a violation of the accused's rights
under s. 7  and substituted a conviction for the lesser included offence which
was the object of the plea bargain).

 

82               It
must always be remembered that a stay of proceedings is only appropriate
""in the clearest of cases"", where the prejudice to the accused's
right to make full answer and defence cannot be remedied or where irreparable prejudice
would be caused to the integrity of the judicial system if the prosecution were
continued.     

 

(iv)  Summary

 

83               Where
life, liberty or security of the person is engaged in a judicial proceeding,
and it is proved on a balance of probabilities that the Crown's failure to make
proper disclosure to the defence has impaired the accused's ability to make
full answer and defence, a violation of s. 7  will have been made out.  In such
circumstances, the court must fashion a just and appropriate remedy, pursuant
to s. 24(1) .  Although the remedy for such a violation will typically be a
disclosure order and adjournment, there may be some extreme cases where the
prejudice to the accused's ability to make full answer and defence or to the
integrity of the justice system is irremediable.  In those ""clearest of
cases"", a stay of proceedings will be appropriate.

 

C.                Application
to the Facts

 








84               The
motion which prompted Thackray J.'s pronouncement of a stay of proceedings was
the fifth such motion since the trial judge was seized of the case.  It was
only the second, however, that related in any way to non-disclosure by the
Crown.  The first motion for a stay based upon non-disclosure, which Thackray
J. rejected in reasons delivered on November 27, pertained to non-disclosures
relating to the order of Campbell A.C.J., which in turn governed the production
of materials which were almost exclusively in the hands of third parties.  Much
of the delayed disclosure by the Crown of the complainants' medical and
therapeutic records, even after the order of Campbell A.C.J., seems to have
been genuinely motivated by a desire to protect the privacy interests of the
complainants, and not to compromise the rights of the accused.  Some of the
non-disclosure was attributable to simple incompetence.  Thackray J. concluded
as much when he noted that there was no evidence to suggest any ""grand
design by the Crown to conceal evidence"" (p. 105).  Although, for reasons
which appear below, I agree that the scope and nature of the disclosure order
were unacceptably broad, I agree with the Court of Appeal that a more
appropriate route for the Crown to have taken would have been to apply for a
variation of the original disclosure order, in which the Crown would have
sought greater accommodation for the privacy interests of the individual
complainants involved.

 








85               Nonetheless,
due in part to an undertaking by the Crown on November 28 to disclose to the
defence its complete files on the case, there is no dispute that the order of
Campbell A.C.J. had been fully complied with by the Crown at the time of the
fifth application by the defence for a stay of proceedings.  This fifth
application was founded upon the non-disclosure of a full transcript of a
witness interview which had previously only partly been disclosed to the
defence, the non-disclosure of several diagrams produced by witnesses in the
course of their preparations with the Crown, and the failure of Crown counsel
to be able to assure the court on the third day of the trial that all relevant
documents in Ms. Harvey's computer files had been fully disclosed to the
defence.  Defence counsel exhorted the trial judge to consider, as well, the
previous disclosure difficulties encountered by the defence.  

 

86               In
granting the stay of proceedings on December 7, Thackray J. concluded that the
Crown's previous uncooperativeness in response to Campbell A.C.J.'s disclosure
order had created an ""aura"" which ultimately pervaded and destroyed
the case.  In the November 27 ruling refusing the fourth application for a
stay, however, Thackray J. had ruled that although the Crown's excuses for
non-disclosure were ""limp"" and indicative of incompetence, there was
no evidence to suggest any ""grand design by the Crown to conceal
evidence"" (p. 105).  Given that the order of Campbell A.C.J. had been
fully complied with by the time of the fifth application for a stay, it is
unclear what changed the trial judge's mind about the Crown's conduct in
relation to that non-disclosure.  Rather, it would appear that Thackray J.
attached greatest significance to the fact that, notwithstanding that the trial
had now begun, Crown counsel could still not provide the court with an
assurance that all relevant information had been disclosed.  This may have been
the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. 

 








87               The
frustration of the trial judge, forced on several occasions to intervene in
order to further the disclosure process, is certainly understandable.  As I
have already noted, the Crown's failure to comply fully with the disclosure
order of Campbell A.C.J. must not be regarded lightly.  At the same time,
however, we must place the considerable disclosure difficulties within their
proper context.  The considerable disclosure difficulties related almost
entirely to the following:  (1) materials which were not in the Crown's
possession at the time of the making of the original disclosure order and which
consequently, for reasons that I shall discuss below, the Crown is not under
any obligation to produce; and (2) work product which, provided that it
contains no material inconsistencies or additional facts not already disclosed
to the defence, the Crown would also not ordinarily be obliged to disclose,
were it not for the undertaking which it gave to the defence the weekend before
the beginning of the trial.  This was not a case where the Crown failed, for
whatever reason, to disclose the fruits of an investigation undertaken by
agents of the state.  Much confusion was attributable to the fact that the law
regarding the disclosure of third parties' private records was highly
uncertain, and nobody was quite sure what to do.

 

88               In
agreeing on November 28 to hand over its complete files in the case, the Crown
may unwittingly have promised more than it could realistically deliver in such
a short time, given the lack of computer literacy of one of the Crown counsel,
the complexities involved in the preparation of the case, and the fact that the
prosecution was being run from two different cities.  These are, as the trial
judge noted, ""limp"" excuses.  Nonetheless, although the Crown, as an
officer of the court, must always strive to fulfil its undertakings, the fact
that the imperfect compliance which ultimately triggered the granting of the
stay was with respect to a voluntary undertaking by the Crown rather than with
respect to an order of the trial judge or a clear legal obligation is a factor
that should not be ignored.

 








89               Finally,
although the non-disclosure of the diagrams prepared by the witnesses, as well
as certain of Ms. Harvey's computer files, apparently contravened the Crown's
good faith undertaking to the defence, it was unclear whether any of this
information contained materially different versions of that which had already
been disclosed to the defence.  In fact, while Mr. Jones did concede that he
could not assure the court that full disclosure had been made in conformity
with the Crown's undertaking, he resolutely took the position, after having
reviewed some of the impugned documents, that none of the undisclosed records
were material.  Nor, for that matter, was there any evidence of improper motive
on the part of the Crown.  I hasten to add that a finding that the
non-disclosures were material might have supported an inference that the Crown
was actively hiding information that was material to the defence. In the instant
case, however, absent any inquiry into the materiality of the non-disclosures,
the most that can be said is that the non-disclosures arose as a result of
inadvertence or lack of communication on the part of the two Crown counsel, or
because Crown counsel undertook to bite off more voluntary disclosure than it
could chew.  There is no proof, moreover, that any delays were attributable to
Crown non-disclosure.  If indeed there were such delays, then it is relevant to
note that, since the accused was not incarcerated pending trial, these delays
would not have prolonged the duration of the accused's imprisonment.

 








90               Bearing
these factors in mind, I would make the following conclusions.  First, although
the Crown's conduct was shoddy and inappropriate, the non-disclosure cannot be
said to have violated the accused's right to full answer and defence.  Contrary
to the impression held by the trial judge, a review of the transcripts reveals
that the Crown did not at any time concede either materiality or prejudice to
the defence.  The most the Crown admitted was that defence counsel might be at
a disadvantage because it had only had a short time during which to review the
most recently disclosed documents.  At its highest, moreover, the prejudice
actually identified by the trial judge was that the non-disclosed diagrams were
relevant in that they might have affected the preparation of the
cross-examination of one of the witnesses.  Cross-examination of that witness
had not yet even begun.  Although I am sympathetic to the difficulties of
preparing an effective cross-examination, I cannot agree that an accused's
right to full answer and defence has probably been infringed merely
because of the possibility that a cross-examination of a witness, which
has not yet begun, may have to be reformulated.  Without any inquiry into the
materiality of the non-disclosed information, it was, therefore, impossible for
the trial judge to conclude that the non-disclosure had, on the balance of
probabilities, prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and
defence.

 

91               Second,
it must be recalled that the whole issue of disclosure in this case arose out
of Campbell A.C.J.'s order requiring that the Crown ""disclose""
records in the hands of third parties and that the complainants authorize
production of such records.  This order was issued without any form of inquiry
into their relevance, let alone a balancing of the privacy rights of the
complainants and the accused's right to a fair trial.  We all agree that this
order was wrong.  Although the error was compounded by the Crown's inept and
ineffective efforts to have this order reviewed and modified, it is clear, at
the end of the day, that the Crown was right in trying to protect the interests
of justice.  The fact that it did so in such a clumsy way should not result in
a stay of proceedings, particularly so when no prejudice was demonstrated to
the fairness of the accused's trial or to his ability to make full answer and
defence.  Thus, even if I had found a violation of s. 7 , this cannot be said to
be one of the ""clearest of cases"" which would mandate a stay of
proceedings.

 

92               To
summarize, I am satisfied that the evidence in the present case did not support
the finding of a violation under s. 7  of the Charter  and, moreover, it
did not reasonably support Thackray J.'s view that the only appropriate course
of action under the circumstances was to stay the proceedings against the
accused.








II.                Production
of Private Records

 

A.                Judgment
of the Court of Appeal

 

93               On
May 16, 1994, the Court of Appeal released additional reasons in O'Connor
(No. 2), supra.  In those reasons, it set out guidelines governing
applications for production of medical records of potential witnesses, which
are not in the possession of the Crown.  It recommended a two-stage procedure
(at p. 261):

 

At the first stage, the applicant must show that the
information contained in the medical records is likely to be relevant either to
an issue in the proceeding or to the competence of the witness to testify. If
the applicant meets this test, then the documents meeting that description must
be disclosed to the court. 

 

The second stage involves the
court reviewing the documents to determine which of them are material to the
defence, in the sense that, without them, the accused's ability to make full
answer and defence would be adversely affected.  If the court is satisfied that
any of the documents fall into this category, then they should be disclosed to
the parties, subject to such conditions as the court deems fit.

 

The court noted that it would often only be possible to make the
ultimate determination as to relevance and materiality at the point in the
trial when the issue to which the information is said to be relevant or
material is addressed.  

 

94               The
court then held that while a liberal interpretation of the word
""relevant"" is to be encouraged, due regard must also be had for other
legitimate legal and societal interests, notably the privacy interests of
complainants in sexual assault cases and the danger that the evidence will be
unprobative and misleading.  As such, consideration should be had for this
Court's remarks in R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, as well as for
the factors set out in s. 276(3)  of the Criminal Code .  








95               The
Court of Appeal then reviewed grounds for disclosure which, in its view, would
not meet the test for relevance.  It would be insufficient, for instance, to
invoke credibility ""at large"".  A simple submission that the records
may relate to ""recent complaint"" would be equally inadequate.  So,
too, would be a claim that the defence hopes to find lack of corroboration or
the existence of a prior inconsistent statement, since this would amount to a
fishing expedition into a person's private records.  Equally insufficient would
be an assertion of relevance based on the mere fact that a witness has received
counselling or psychiatric assistance as a consequence of an alleged sexual
assault.  The fact of having received such counselling could not, moreover,
justify a conclusion that the witness's evidence may be unreliable. 

 

96               The
Court of Appeal then turned to a consideration of appropriate procedures to
guide the parties on an application for pre-trial production of medical records
held by third parties.  It made the following points (at pp. 267-68):

 

--    the application for
disclosure should ideally be supported by affidavits;

 

--    notice should be given to
Crown counsel, to the third party in possession, and to the complainant or
other witness with a privacy interest in the records;

 

                   --    the
application should be heard by the trial judge whenever possible;

 








--    at the hearing, persons
with an interest in the records are entitled to present argument relating to
issues of privacy and privilege, and to give evidence with respect to the
relevance and materiality of the records in question;

 

--    the judge will review the
records to determine materiality, a procedure which may be done in camera
or under a publication ban where the materials involved are of a sensitive
nature;

 

--    if the threshold test is
not met, the records shall be sealed and retained in the file in the event they
need to be reviewed later;

 

--    any party to the original
application may apply for a variation of the disclosure or non-disclosure order
on proper grounds, and further application may be made if new evidence arises
subsequently. 

 

The court declined to discuss the issue of privilege, both because
full disclosure was made in this case, and because no basis in relevance or
materiality was established for the production of the records.

 

B.                Analysis
of Production Guidelines

 

97               Determining
the nature and extent of production to the defence of a complainant's medical
and therapeutic records, as well as any other documents in which the
complainant holds a reasonable expectation of privacy, is a difficult and
potentially value-laden exercise.  I commend the initiative taken by the Court
of Appeal in setting down its thoughtful approach to the issue.  It can be seen
that I approve of and adopt many of their observations and suggestions in the
forthcoming pages.  








98               As
a preliminary matter, it should be noted that the issue before us relates to
the production of private records held by third parties.  We are not concerned
here with the extent of the Crown's obligation to disclose private records in
its possession, or with the question whether privacy and equality interests may
militate against such disclosure by the Crown.  Although my colleagues Lamer
C.J. and Sopinka J. deal with these questions at great length in their reasons,
I prefer not to pronounce on these issues as they do not arise in this appeal
and were not argued before us.  Any comment on these questions would be
strictly obiter.

 

99               The
question of production of private records not in the possession of the Crown
arises in a wide variety of contexts.  Although many of these contexts involve
medical and therapeutic records of complainants to sexual assault, it will
become apparent that the principles and guidelines outlined herein are equally
applicable to any record, in the hands of a third party, in which a
reasonable expectation of privacy lies.  Although the determination of when a
reasonable expectation of privacy actually exists in a particular record (and,
if so, to what extent it exists) is inherently fact- and context-sensitive,
this may include records that are medical or therapeutic in nature, school
records, private diaries, and activity logs prepared by social workers, to name
just a few.  For the sake of convenience, information that is generically of
this nature shall hereafter be referred to as ""private records held by
third parties"".

 

(i)    Basic Principles
Governing Disclosure and Production

 








100             The
basic principles governing disclosure were most recently summarized by this
Court in R. v. Chaplin, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 727.  It is now clearly
established that the Crown is under a general duty to disclose all information,
whether inculpatory or exculpatory, except evidence that is beyond the control
of the prosecution, clearly irrelevant, privileged or subject to a right of
privacy.  However, where the Crown disputes the existence of the information
sought by the defence, then the defence must first establish a basis which
could enable the presiding judge to conclude that there is in existence further
material which may be useful to the accused in making full answer and defence: 
Chaplin, supra, at pp. 743-45.

 

101             Though
the obligation on the Crown to disclose has found renewed vigour since the
advent of the Charter, in particular s. 7 , this obligation is not
contingent upon there first being established any violation of the Charter. 
Rather, full and fair disclosure is a fundamental aspect of the Crown's duty to
serve the Court as a faithful public agent, entrusted not with winning or
losing trials but rather with seeing that justice is served:  Stinchcombe,
supra, at p. 333.  For this reason, as I have already mentioned, although
a disclosure order can be a constitutional remedy, the obligation on the
Crown to disclose all information in its possession that is not clearly
irrelevant, privileged or subject to a right of privacy undoubtedly has force
independent of any violation of the accused's s. 7  rights.  Because of the
Crown's unique obligations, both to the court and to the public, it, alone,
owes a duty to disclose to the defence.  This duty does not extend to third
parties.  Similarly, the obligation upon the Crown to disclose all relevant
material does not extend to records which are not within its possession or
control.  See, also, R. v. Gingras (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 53 (Alta.
C.A.). 

 








102             Given
that there is no duty on third parties to disclose, it has been suggested that
s. 698 of the Code provides the basis upon which a court may order
production of third parties' private records.  In particular, ss. 698 and 700
authorize the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum or a subpoena
duces tecum to any person that is likely to give material evidence.  With
respect, however, I believe that this argument rests on a misunderstanding of
the nature of the subpoena powers in s. 698.  

 

103             Although
a subpoena duces tecum requires that a witness who is the object of the
subpoena bring the requested documents into court, the subpoena does not
automatically call for an order requiring the documents to be produced to the
court for inspection, let alone to the defence.  Production will only be
ordered if the documents are likely to be relevant and if production is
appropriate, having regard to all of the relevant considerations.  In
exercising its discretion to order production, the court must, of course, have
regard to the Charter rights of the accused and the other interests at
stake, including any claims of privilege or a right to privacy which the
subject or guardian of the records might successfully assert in respect of
those documents.  

 








104             One
of the Charter values to be weighed is the ""right"" to
disclosure, which is in reality an adjunct of the s. 7  right to make full
answer and defence.  Though the right to full answer and defence is generally
asserted in the context of material non-disclosure by the Crown, we must
recall that a purposive approach to the Charter requires that due
consideration also be given to the effect of the exercise of discretion
on an individual's rights.  In particular, an effects-oriented approach to s. 7 
dictates that when an accused is unable to make full answer and defence to the
charges brought against him as a result of his inability to obtain information
that is material to his defence, it is of little concern whether that
information is in the hands of the state or in the hands of a third party.  The
effect is still potentially to deprive an individual of his liberty
while denying him the ability to make full answer and defence.   

 

105             An
order for production of private records held by third parties does not arise as
a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  since, at the moment of the
request for production, the accused's rights under the Charter have not
been violated.  Nonetheless, when deciding whether to order production of
private records, the court must exercise its discretion in a manner that is
respectful of Charter values:  Dagenais, supra, at p.
875.  In particular, the nature, scope and breadth of the production order will
ultimately depend upon a balancing of Charter rights which seeks to
ensure that any adverse effects upon one right is proportionate to the salutary
effects of the constitutional objective being furthered: Dagenais, at
p. 890. 

 

(ii)   The Competing
Constitutional Rights at Issue

 

106             In
formulating an approach to govern production of private records held by third
parties, it is important to appreciate fully the nature of the various
interests at issue.  I will describe briefly each of the three constitutional
rights that I believe to be implicated in this analysis: (1) the right to full
answer and defence; (2) the right to privacy; and (3) the right to equality
without discrimination.

 

  (a) The Right to a Fair
Trial

 








107             Much
has been written about the right to a fair trial.  An individual who is
deprived of the ability to make full answer and defence is deprived of
fundamental justice.  However, full answer and defence, like any right, cannot
be considered in the abstract.  The principles of fundamental justice vary
according to the context in which they are invoked.  For this reason, certain
procedural protections might be constitutionally mandated in one context but
not in another:  R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 361.  Moreover,
though the Constitution guarantees the accused a fair hearing, it does not
guarantee the most favourable procedures imaginable:  Lyons, supra,
at p. 362.  Finally, although fairness of the trial and, as a corollary,
fairness in defining the limits of full answer and defence, must primarily be
viewed from the point of view of the accused, both notions must nevertheless
also be considered from the point of view of the community and the
complainant:  E. (A.W.), supra, at p. 198.  There is no question
that the right to make full answer and defence cannot be so broad as to grant
the defence a fishing licence into the personal and private lives of others. 
The question is therefore not whether the defence can be limited in its
attempts to obtain production of private records held by third parties, but how
it can be limited in a manner that accords appropriate constitutional
protection to all of the constitutional rights at issue.

 

108             When
the defence seeks production of third party records whose contents it is not
aware of, the defence is obviously in a position of some difficulty.  In
assessing whether this difficulty poses a threat of constitutional proportions
to the accused's ability to make fair answer and defence, however, one thing
must be borne in mind.  Given that these records are not in the possession of
the Crown and have not constituted a basis for its investigations, they do not,
by definition, constitute part of the state's ""case to meet"" against
the accused.  Unlike sealed wiretap packages, which represent the fruits of
state investigation of the accused, private records in the hands of third
parties are not subject to such a presumption of materiality.

 








109             I
would note, finally, that an important element of trial fairness is the need to
remove discriminatory beliefs and bias from the fact-finding process:  Seaboyer,
supra.  As I pointed out in R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at
pp. 622-23, for instance, the assumption that private therapeutic or
counselling records are relevant to full answer and defence is often highly
questionable, in that these records may very well have a greater potential to
derail than to advance the truth-seeking process:

 

...medical records concerning statements made in
the course of therapy are both hearsay and inherently problematic as regards
reliability.  A witness's concerns expressed in the course of therapy after the
fact, even assuming they are correctly understood and reliably noted, cannot be
equated with evidence given in the course of a trial.  Both the context in
which the statements are made and the expectations of the parties are entirely
different.  In a trial, a witness is sworn to testify as to the particular
events in issue.  By contrast, in therapy an entire spectrum of factors such as
personal history, thoughts, emotions as well as particular acts may inform the
dialogue between therapist and patient.  Thus, there is serious risk that
such statements could be taken piecemeal out of the context in which they were
made to provide a foundation for entirely unwarranted inferences by the trier
of fact. [Emphasis added.]

 

(b)   The Right to Privacy

 








110             This
Court has on many occasions recognized the great value of privacy in our society. 
It has expressed sympathy for the proposition that s. 7  of the Charter 
includes a right to privacy: Beare, supra, at p. 412; B. (R.)
v. Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, at
p. 369, per La Forest J.  On numerous other occasions, it has spoken of
privacy in terms of s. 8  of the Charter : see, e.g., Hunter v. Southam
Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Pohoretsky, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945; R.
v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417.  On still other occasions, it has
underlined the importance of privacy in the common law:  McInerney v.
MacDonald, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 138, at pp. 148-49; Hill v. Church of
Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130.

 

111             On
no occasion has the relationship between ""liberty"", ""security of
the person"", and essential human dignity been more carefully canvassed by
this Court than in the reasons of Wilson J. in R. v. Morgentaler, [1988]
1 S.C.R. 30.  In her judgment, she notes that the Charter and the right
to individual liberty guaranteed therein are tied inextricably to the concept
of human dignity.  She urges that both ""liberty"" and ""security
of the person"" are capable of a broad range of meaning and that a
purposive interpretation of the Charter requires that the right to liberty
contained in s. 7  be read to ""guarantee[] to every individual a degree of
personal autonomy over important decisions intimately affecting their private
lives"" (p. 171).  Concurring on this point with the majority, she notes,
as well, that `security of the person' is sufficiently broad to include
protection for the psychological integrity of the individual.

 

112             Equally
relevant, for our purposes, is Lamer J.'s recognition in Mills, supra,
at p. 920, that the right to security of the person encompasses the right to be
protected against psychological trauma.  In the context of his discussion of
the effects on an individual of unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11 (b)
of the Charter , he noted that such trauma could take the form of

 

stigmatization of the accused, loss of privacy, stress
and anxiety resulting from a multitude of factors, including possible
disruption of family, social life and work, legal costs, uncertainty as to the
outcome and sanction.

 








If the word ""complainant"" were substituted for the word
""accused"" in the above extract, I think that we would have an
excellent description of the psychological traumas potentially faced by sexual
assault complainants.  These people must contemplate the threat of disclosing
to the very person accused of assaulting them in the first place, and quite
possibly in open court, records containing intensely private aspects of their
lives, possibly containing thoughts and statements which have never even been
shared with the closest of friends or family.

 

113             In
the same way that this Court recognized in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra,
that the ""principles of fundamental justice"" in s. 7  are informed by fundamental
tenets of our common law system and by ss. 8  to 14 of the Charter, I
think that the terms ""liberty"" and ""security of the person""
must, as essential aspects of a free and democratic society, be animated by the
rights and values embodied in the common law, the civil law and the Charter. 
In my view, it is not without significance that one of those rights, s. 8 , has
been identified as having as its fundamental purpose ""to protect
individuals from unjustified state intrusions upon their privacy"" (Hunter,
supra, at p. 160).  The right to be secure from unreasonable search and
seizure plays a pivotal role in a document that purports to contain the
blueprint of the Canadian vision of what constitutes a free and democratic
society.  Respect for individual privacy is an essential component of what it
means to be ""free"".  As a corollary, the infringement of this right
undeniably impinges upon an individual's ""liberty"" in our free and
democratic society.

 








114             A
similarly broad approach to the notion of liberty has been taken in the United
States.  In Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564
(1972), at pp. 571-72, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that
""liberty"" was a ""broad and majestic term"" and that
""[i]n a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the
meaning of ""liberty"" must be broad indeed"".  More significant
for our purposes, the right to privacy was expressly found to reside in the
term ""liberty"" in the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of Roe
v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).  In a similar vein, the right to personal
privacy has also received recognition in international documents such as
Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
999 U.N.T.S. 171, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
G.A. Res. 217 A (III), U.N. Doc. A/810, at 71 (1948), and Article 8 of the European
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 213
U.N.T.S. 221.

 

115             Privacy
has traditionally also been protected by the common law, through causes of
action such as trespass and defamation.  In Hill, supra, which
dealt with a Charter challenge to the common law tort of defamation,
Cory J. reiterates the constitutional significance of the right to privacy (at
para. 121):

 

...reputation is intimately related to the right to
privacy which has been accorded constitutional protection.  As La Forest J.
wrote in R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at p. 427, privacy,
including informational privacy, is ""(g)rounded in man's physical and
moral autonomy"" and ""is essential for the well-being of the
individual"".  The publication of defamatory comments constitutes an
invasion of the individual's personal privacy and is an affront to that
person's dignity.  The protection of a person's reputation is indeed worthy of
protection in our democratic society and must be carefully balanced against the
equally important right of freedom of expression.  [Emphasis added.]

 

116             Quebec,
for its part, has inserted into its new Civil Code, S.Q. 1991, c. 64,
arts. 35 and 36, which read as follows:

 

35.  Every person has a right to
the respect of his reputation and privacy.








No one may invade the privacy of a
person without the consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law.

 

36.  The following acts, in
particular, may be considered as invasions of the privacy of a person:

 

(1) entering or taking anything in
his dwelling;

 

(2) intentionally intercepting or using his private
communications;

 

(3) appropriating or using his
image or voice while he is in private premises;

 

(4) keeping his private life under
observation by any means;

 

(5) using his name, image,
likeness or voice for a purpose other than the legitimate information of the
public;

 

(6) using his correspondence,
manuscripts or other personal documents.

 

 

As well, s. 5 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms,
R.S.Q., c. C-12, reads:

 

5.    Every person has
a right to respect for his private life.

 

117             It
is apparent, however, that privacy can never be absolute.  It must be balanced
against legitimate societal needs.  This Court has recognized that the essence
of such a balancing process lies in assessing reasonable expectation of
privacy, and balancing that expectation against the necessity of
interference from the state:  Hunter, supra, at pp. 159-60. 
Evidently, the greater the reasonable expectation of privacy and the more
significant the deleterious effects flowing from its breach, the more
compelling must be the state objective, and the salutary effects of that
objective, in order to justify interference with this right.  See Dagenais,
supra.

 








118             In
R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, albeit in the context of a discussion
of s. 8  of the Charter , a majority of this Court identified one context
in which the right to privacy would generally arise in respect of documents and
records (at p. 293):

 

In fostering the underlying values of dignity,
integrity and autonomy, it is fitting that s. 8  of the Charter  should
seek to protect a biographical core of personal information which individuals
in a free and democratic society would wish to maintain and control from
dissemination to the state.  This would include information which tends to
reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.
[Emphasis added.]

 

Although I prefer not to decide today whether this definition is
exhaustive of the right to privacy in respect of all manners of documents and
records, I am satisfied that the nature of the private records which are the
subject matter of this appeal properly brings them within that rubric.  Such
items may consequently be viewed as disclosing a reasonable expectation of
privacy which is worthy of protection under s. 7  of the Charter .

 

119             The
essence of privacy, however, is that once invaded, it can seldom be regained. 
For this reason, it is all the more important for reasonable expectations of
privacy to be protected at the point of disclosure.  As La Forest J. observed
in Dyment, supra, at p. 430:

 

...if the privacy of the individual is to be
protected, we cannot afford to wait to vindicate it only after it has been
violated.  This is inherent in the notion of being secure against
unreasonable searches and seizures.  Invasions of privacy must be prevented,
and where privacy is outweighed by other societal claims, there must be clear
rules setting forth the conditions in which it can be violated.  [Emphasis
in last sentence added.]

 








In the same way that our constitution generally requires that a
search be premised upon a pre-authorization which is of a nature and manner
that is proportionate to the reasonable expectation of privacy at issue (Hunter,
supra; Thomson Newspapers, supra), s. 7  of the Charter 
requires a reasonable system of ""pre-authorization"" to justify
court-sanctioned intrusions into the private records of witnesses in legal
proceedings. Although it may appear trite to say so, I underline that when a
private document or record is revealed and the reasonable expectation of privacy
therein is thereby displaced, the invasion is not with respect to the
particular document or record in question.  Rather, it is an invasion of the
dignity and self-worth of the individual, who enjoys the right to privacy as an
essential aspect of his or her liberty in a free and democratic society.

 

(c)   The Right to Equality
Without Discrimination

 

120             Unlike
virtually every other offence in the Criminal Code , sexual assault is a
crime which overwhelmingly affects women, children and the disabled.  Ninety
percent of all victims of sexual assault are female:  Osolin, supra,
at p. 669, per Cory J.  Moreover, studies suggest that between 50 and 80
percent of women institutionalized for psychiatric disorders have prior
histories of sexual abuse  (T. Firsten, ""An Exploration of the Role of
Physical and Sexual Abuse for Psychiatrically Institutionalized Women""
(1990), unpublished research paper, available from Ontario Women's
Directorate).  Children are most highly vulnerable (Sexual Offences Against
Children (the Badgley Report), vol. 1 (1984)).

 








121             It
is a common phenomenon in this day and age for one who has been sexually
victimized to seek counselling or therapy in relation to this occurrence.  It
therefore stands to reason that disclosure rules or practices which make mental
health or medical records routinely accessible in sexual offence proceedings
will have disproportionately invasive consequences for women, particularly
those with disabilities, and children.  In particular, in determining questions
of disclosure of records of persons allegedly assaulted in institutions where
they get psychiatric assistance, the courts must take care not to create a
class of vulnerable victims who have to choose between accusing their attackers
and maintaining the confidentiality of their records.

 

122             This
Court has recognized the pernicious role that past evidentiary rules in both
the Criminal Code  and the common law, now regarded as discriminatory,
once played in our legal system:  Seaboyer, supra.  We must be
careful not to permit such practices to reappear under the guise of extensive
and unwarranted inquiries into the past histories and private lives of
complainants of sexual assault.  We must not allow the defence to do indirectly
what it cannot do directly under s. 276 of the Code.  This would close
one discriminatory door only to open another.

 








123             As
I noted in Osolin, supra, at pp. 624-25, uninhibited disclosure
of complainants' private lives indulges the discriminatory suspicion that women
and children's reports of sexual victimization are uniquely likely to be
fabricated.  Put another way, if there were an explicit requirement in the Code
requiring corroboration before women or children could bring sexual assault
charges, such a provision would raise serious concerns under s. 15  of the Charter . 
In my view, a legal system which devalues the evidence of complainants to sexual
assault by de facto presuming their uncreditworthiness would
raise similar concerns.  It would not reflect, far less promote, ""a
society in which all are secure in the knowledge that they are recognized at
law as human beings equally deserving of concern, respect and
consideration"" (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989]
1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 171). 

 

124             Routine
insistence on the exposure of complainants' personal backgrounds has the
potential to reflect a built-in bias in the criminal justice system against
those most vulnerable to repeat victimization.  Such requests, in essence, rest
on the assumption that the personal and psychological backgrounds and profiles
of complainants of sexual assault are relevant as to whether or not the
complainant consented to the sexual contact, or whether the accused honestly
believed that she consented.  Although the defence must be free to demonstrate,
without resort to stereotypical lines of reasoning, that such information is
actually relevant to a live issue at trial, it would mark the triumph of
stereotype over logic if courts and lawyers were simply to assume such
relevance to exist, without requiring any evidence to this effect whatsoever.  

 

125             It
is revealing, for instance, to compare the approach often taken to private
records in sexual assault trials with the approach taken in three decisions in
which private files were sought by defence counsel in situations which did not
involve sexual assaults.  In Gingras, supra, the defence in a
murder case sought disclosure of the prison file of an important Crown witness,
who was serving time in a penitentiary in another province.  The credibility of
the witness was invoked as being at issue.  In addition to finding important
irregularities in the disclosure order, the Court concluded that the disclosure
request amounted to no more than a fishing expedition and therefore quashed the
order, notwithstanding the seriousness of the charge against the accused.

 








126             In
both R. v. Gratton, [1987] O.J. No. 1984 (Prov. Ct.), and R. v.
Callaghan, [1993] O.J. No. 2013 (Ont. Ct. (Prov. Div.)), an accused charged
with assault of a police officer sought disclosure of the officer's personnel
files and, in particular, any files relating to complaints or disciplinary
actions taken against the officer.  In both cases, the justification offered
for this disclosure was to show that the officer had a propensity for violence. 
In both cases, in the absence of any evidence as to the likelihood that the
records would contain evidence to the predisposition to violence or
unreasonable use of force, the judge refused to give disclosure of those
files.  The contents of the files were characterized as hearsay, as potentially
based on unfounded allegations, and as generally irrelevant.  The only
disclosure granted was of a file containing details of the formal
investigation of the particular complaint filed by the accused in relation
to activity which was the subject matter of the charges.   

 

127             I
see no reason to treat a sexual assault complainant any differently, or to
accord any less respect to her credibility or privacy, than that which was
accorded police officers and convicted criminals in the above-mentioned cases.

 

128             All
of these factors, in my mind, justify concluding not only that a privacy
analysis creates a presumption against ordering production of private records,
but also that ample and meaningful consideration must be given to complainants'
equality rights under the Charter when formulating an appropriate
approach to the production of complainants' records.  Consequently, I have
great sympathy for the observation of Hill J. in R. v. Barbosa (1994),
92 C.C.C. (3d) 131 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), to this effect (at p. 141):

 








In addressing the disclosure of records, relating to
past treatment, analysis, assessment or care of a complainant, it is necessary
to remember that the pursuit of full answer and defence on behalf of an accused
person should be achieved without indiscriminately or arbitrarily eradicating
the privacy of the complainant.  Systemic revictimization of a complainant
fosters disrepute for the criminal justice system. [Emphasis added.]

 

(iii)  Balancing Competing
Values

 

129             As
Lamer C.J. recently noted for the majority in Dagenais, supra, at
p. 877, competing constitutional considerations must be balanced with
particular care:

 

A hierarchical approach to rights, which places some
over others, must be avoided, both when interpreting the Charter and
when developing the common law.  When the protected rights of two individuals
come into conflict... Charter principles require a balance to be
achieved that fully respects the importance of both sets of rights.

 

Notwithstanding my agreement with this proposition, I would
emphasize that the imagery of conflicting rights which it conjures up may not
always be appropriate.  One such example is the interrelation between the
equality rights of complainants in sexual assault trials and the rights of the
accused to a fair trial.  The eradication of discriminatory beliefs and
practices in the conduct of such trials will enhance rather than detract from
the fairness of such trials.  Conversely, sexual assault trials that are fair
will promote the equality of women and children, who are most often the victims.

 








130             From
my earlier remarks, moreover, it should be clear that I am satisfied that
witnesses have a right to privacy in relation to private documents and records
(i.e. documents and records in which they hold a reasonable expectation of
privacy) which are not a part of the Crown's ""case to meet"" against
the accused.  They are entitled not to be deprived of their reasonable
expectation of privacy except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.  In cases such as the present one, any interference with the
individual's right to privacy comes about as a result of another person's
assertion that this interference is necessary in order to make full answer and
defence.  As important as the right to full answer and defence may be, it must
co-exist with other constitutional rights, rather than trample them:  Dagenais,
supra, at p. 877.  Privacy and equality must not be sacrificed
willy-nilly on the altar of trial fairness.

 

131             The
proper approach to be taken in contexts involving competing constitutional
rights may be analogized from Dagenais, at p. 891.  In particular, since
an applicant seeking production of private records from third parties is seeking
to invoke the power of the state to violate the privacy rights of other
individuals, the applicant must show that the use of the state power to compel
production is justified in a free and democratic society.  If it is not, then
the other person's privacy rights will have been infringed in a manner that is
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  

 








132             The
use of state power to compel production of private records will be justified in
a free and democratic society when the following criteria are applied.  First,
production should only be granted when it is shown that the accused cannot
obtain the information sought by any other reasonably available and effective
alternative means.  Second, production which infringes upon a right to privacy
must be as limited as reasonably possible to fulfil the right to make full
answer and defence.  Third, arguments urging production must rest upon
permissible chains of reasoning, rather than upon discriminatory assumptions
and stereotypes.  Finally, there must be a proportionality between the salutary
effects of production on the accused's right to make full answer and defence as
compared with the deleterious effects on the party whose private records are
being produced.  The measure of proportionality must reflect the extent to
which a reasonable expectation of privacy vests in the particular records, on
the one hand, and the importance of the issue to which the evidence relates, on
the other.  Moreover, courts must remain alive to the fact that, in certain
cases, the deleterious effects of production may demonstrably include negative
effects on the complainant's course of therapy, threatening psychological harm
to the individual concerned and thereby resulting in a concomitant deprivation
of the individual's security of the person.

 

133             All
of the above considerations must be borne in mind when formulating an
appropriate approach to the difficult issue raised in this appeal. Using these
ground rules to structure our analysis, it is now possible to elaborate upon an
approach to production of third parties' private records that, it is hoped,
will maintain the greatest possible degree of proportionality in reconciling
the equally important constitutional concerns of full answer and defence,
privacy, and equality without discrimination.

 

(iv)  Procedure for Obtaining
Production

 








134             I
would give substance to the general principles elaborated above by way of the
following process.  The first step for an accused who seeks production of
private records held by a third party is to obtain and serve on the third party
a subpoena duces tecum.  When the subpoena is served, the accused should
notify the Crown, the subject of the records, and any other person with an
interest in the confidentiality of the records that the accused will ask the
trial judge for an order for their production.  Then, at the trial, the accused
must bring an application supported by appropriate affidavit evidence showing
that the records are likely to be relevant either to an issue in the trial or
to the competence to testify of the subject of the records.  If the records are
relevant, the court must balance the salutary and deleterious effects of
ordering that the records be produced to determine whether, and to what extent,
production should be ordered. 

 

(a)   Subpoena duces tecum and
Notice to Interested Parties

 

135             The
form of the subpoena duces tecum and the procedure for its issuance are
described in Part XXII of the Criminal Code .  In particular, a subpoena
will not issue unless the applicant shows that the witness is likely to give
material evidence in the proceeding: s. 698(1) .  The function of the subpoena
is to summon the witness -- in this case, the guardian of the records -- to
court and to require the witness to bring the documents described in the
subpoena.  It does not, in itself, require the witness to produce the records
to the court or to the defence.  

 

136             When
the subpoena is served, the accused should give written notice to anyone with
an interest in the confidentiality of the records that a motion will be brought
for an order for production of the records.  Interested persons include the
Crown, the person who is the subject of the records, the guardian of the
records, and any other person required by statute to be notified.  Failure to
give notice to all interested parties will be fatal to the application,
although the accused may reapply and, as a matter of convenience, notice to the
guardian of the records may accompany the subpoena duces tecum.  








(b)   Application for
Production

 

137             At
the trial, when the accused applies for an order for production of the records,
the judge should follow a two-stage approach.  First, the accused must
demonstrate that the information contained in the records is likely to be
relevant either to an issue in the proceedings or to the competence to testify
of the person who is the subject of the records.  If the information does not
meet this threshold of relevance, then the analysis ends here and no order will
issue.  However, if the information is likely relevant to an issue at trial or
to the competence of the subject to testify, the court must weigh the positive
and negative consequences of production, with a view to determining whether,
and to what extent, production should be ordered.  At each stage counsel for
all interested parties should be permitted to make submissions.

 

(1)  Relevance

 

138             At
the outset, the accused must establish a basis which could enable the presiding
judge to conclude that there is actually in existence further material which
may be useful to the accused in making full answer and defence, in the sense
that it is logically probative (Chaplin, supra, at pp. 743-45). 
In other words, the accused must satisfy the court that the information
contained in the records is likely to be relevant either to an issue in
the proceeding or to the competence of the subject to testify (O'Connor No.
2, supra).

 








139             It
may be useful at this stage for the third party guardian of the records to
prepare a list of the records in its possession.  In an appropriate case, the
trial judge may require such a list to be provided to the accused and the other
interested parties.  This was done, for example, in Barbosa, supra,
albeit in the somewhat different context of a request by the Crown to withhold
disclosure of records in its own possession.  In that decision, Hill J. made
the following comments about the utility of an inventory of records (at p.
136):

 

The existence of an inventory not only promotes
procedural efficiency during argument of an application of this type, but also
has the advantage of potentially permitting defence counsel to focus the
subject-matter of his application to a population of documents less than the
whole of those in the custody of the relevant custodian.  On occasion, such an
inventory promotes further informal discussions between defence and Crown
counsel leading to further disclosure without review by the court.

 

140             However,
I wish to emphasize that, like any other motion, an application for an order
for production of private records held by a third party must be accompanied by
affidavit evidence which establishes to the judge's satisfaction that the
information sought is likely to be relevant.  The accused's demonstration that
information is likely to be relevant must be based on evidence, not on
speculative assertions or on discriminatory or stereotypical reasoning.

 








141             The
Chief Justice and Sopinka J. argue that accused persons are placed in a
difficult situation by the requirement that they prove the likely relevance of
the documents without having access to them.  My colleagues point to the
decisions of this Court in Carey v. Ontario, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637, Dersch
v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505 (especially at pp.
1513-14), R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, and R. v. Durette,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 469, and conclude that the standard of ""likely
relevance"" should not be interpreted as an onerous burden.  I would begin
by noting that Carey arose in the context of a civil action in which
neither the right to full answer and defence nor any constitutional right of
privacy were engaged; it therefore has no application here.  As for Dersch,
Garofoli and Durette, a majority of this Court held in those
cases that an accused is entitled to have access to information used by police
to obtain a wiretap authorization because, without such access, the accused
cannot realistically challenge the legality of the surveillance.  However, in
those cases, the accused sought access to records created by the state as part
of its investigation; that situation can hardly be compared to the situation of
an accused who demands access to therapeutic or other private records created
and held by a third party.  The records here in question are not within the
possession or control of the Crown, do not form part of the Crown's ""case
to meet"", and were created by a third party for a purpose unrelated to the
investigation or prosecution of the offence.  In my opinion, it cannot be
assumed that such records are likely to be relevant, and if the accused is unable
to show that they are, then the application for production must be rejected as
it amounts to nothing more than a fishing expedition.

 








142             The
burden on an accused to demonstrate likely relevance is a significant one.  For
instance, it would be insufficient for the accused to demand production simply
on the basis of a bare, unsupported assertion that the records might impact on
""recent complaint"" or the ""kind of person"" the witness is. 
Similarly, the applicant cannot simply invoke credibility ""at large"",
but must rather provide some basis to show that there is likely to be
information in the impugned records which would relate to the complainant's
credibility on a particular, material issue at trial.  Equally inadequate is a
bare, unsupported assertion that a prior inconsistent statement might be
revealed, or that the defence wishes to explore the records for
""allegations of sexual abuse by other people"".  Such requests,
without more, are indicative of the very type of fishing expedition that this
Court has previously rejected in other contexts.  See, in the context of
cross-examination on sexual history, Osolin, supra, at p. 618, per
L'Heureux-Dubé J. dissenting, and Seaboyer, supra, at p. 634, per
McLachlin J. for the majority; in the context of search and seizure, Baron
v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 448, per Sopinka J. for the
Court, and Hunter, supra, at p. 167, per Dickson J. (as he
then was) for the Court; in the context of wiretaps and their supporting
affidavits, Chaplin, supra, at p. 746, per Sopinka J. for
the Court, Durette, supra, at p. 523, per L'Heureux-Dubé
J. dissenting, R. v. Thompson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111, at p. 1169, per
La Forest J. dissenting, and R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 55,
per La Forest J. for the majority.  See also Cross on Evidence
(7th ed. 1990), at pp. 51 et seq.; Halsbury's Laws of England
(4th ed. 1976), vol. 17, para. 5, at p. 7.; Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.
1940), vol. 1, para. 9, at pp. 655 et seq.

 

143             Similarly,
the mere fact that a witness has a medical or psychiatric record cannot be
taken as indicative of the potential unreliability of his or her testimony. 
Any suggestion that a particular treatment, therapy, illness, or disability
implies unreliability must be informed by cogent evidence, rather than
stereotype, myth or prejudice.  For these reasons, it would also be
inappropriate for judicial notice to be taken of the fact that unreliability
may be inferred from any particular course of treatment.  See R. v. K. (V.)
(1991), 4 C.R. (4th) 338 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 350-51.

 








144             Finally,
it must not be presumed that the mere fact that a witness received treatment or
counselling after a sexual assault indicates that the records will contain
information that is relevant to the defence.  The focus of therapy is vastly
different from that of an investigation or other process undertaken for the
purposes of the trial.  While investigations and witness testimony are oriented
toward ascertaining historical truth -- namely, the facts surrounding
the alleged assault -- therapy generally focuses on exploring the complainant's
emotional and psychological responses to certain events, after the
alleged assault has taken place.  Victims often question their perceptions and
judgment, especially if the assailant was an acquaintance.  Therapy is an
opportunity for the victim to explore her own feelings of doubt and
insecurity.  It is not a fact-finding exercise.  Consequently, the vast
majority of information noted during therapy sessions bears no relevance
whatsoever or, at its highest, only an attenuated sense of relevance to the
issues at trial.  Moreover, as I have already noted elsewhere, much of this
information is inherently unreliable and, therefore, may frustrate rather than
further the truth-seeking process.  Thus, although the fact that an individual
has sought counselling after an alleged assault may certainly raise the
applicant's hopes for a fruitful fishing expedition, it does not follow, absent
other evidence, that information found in those records is likely to be
relevant to the accused's defence.

 

145             Unlike
my colleagues Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J., I would not take the ""sheer number""
of cases in which production has been ordered in the past as a demonstration of
the potential relevance of therapeutic records.  Whatever may have been their
past practice in this regard, judges should be encouraged to carefully
scrutinize claims of relevance in a manner that is sensitive to the therapeutic
context and the nature of records created in that context.  Without such
sensitivity, the danger is great that records having no real relevance will be
produced, the search for truth frustrated, and the rights of complainants
needlessly violated.

 








146             In
establishing the required evidentiary basis, the applicant may resort to the
Crown's disclosure, to its own witnesses, and to cross-examination of the Crown
witnesses at both the preliminary inquiry and the trial.  On some occasions, it
may also be necessary to introduce expert evidence to lay the foundation for a
production application (for instance, expert evidence to the effect that a
certain type of therapy may lead to ""created memories"").  The
determination of relevance is a fluid, rather than fixed, process.  In
consequence, information which cannot be proved relevant at one point during
the trial may later become relevant, in which case a further application for
production may be warranted.  However, regardless of when it is brought, an
application for production will not succeed if it is not supported by evidence
demonstrating the likely relevance of the records.

 

147             I
would like to make two final observations on the subject of relevance.  The
first of these relates to the Court of Appeal's comment that relevance should
be determined with due regard for ""other legitimate legal and societal
interests, including the privacy interests of complainants"" (O'Connor
(No. 2), at pp. 261-62).  In my view, the privacy rights of complainants
should be considered separately, rather than factored into the analysis of
relevance.  It is important to remember that the rationale underlying resort to
privilege or privacy rights is diametrically opposed to that underlying most
ordinary evidentiary rules of exclusion.  Privilege and privacy interests would
exclude evidence despite the fact that such evidence might further the
truth-seeking process.  On the other hand, ordinary rules of exclusion are
generally motivated by the desire to further the truth-seeking process,
in that they tend to exclude evidence which might be unreliable, which might
mislead or prejudice the trier of fact, or which might otherwise prejudice the
fairness of the trial.  Consequently, it is both easier and more intellectually
honest to consider privacy and societal interests in a separate, balancing
step.

 








148             However,
as I have already noted, consideration for equality is not alien to the
objectives of finding the truth and conducting a fair trial.  On the contrary,
all of these objectives dictate that a court be precluded from drawing
inferences on the basis of discriminatory or stereotypical lines of reasoning. 
For instance, it is impermissible to seek production of records containing
reference to other sexual activity to support the inference that because the
complainant has engaged in unrelated sexual activity she is more likely to have
consented to the activity in question, or less worthy of belief:  Seaboyer,
supra.  

 

149             My
second observation relates to the competence to testify of the subject of the
records.  A witness is presumed competent to testify until otherwise shown. 
Incompetence to testify can be shown in many ways, such as calling a doctor who
has treated the witness, which do not require disclosure of private medical
records.  If competence is the basis for defence counsel's application for
production of private medical records, then the court should first consider if
there are any other reasonable alternatives of testing the witness's competence
which would constitute a lesser invasion into the witness's privacy.

 

(2)   Balancing

 








150             If
the trial judge concludes that the records are not likely to be relevant to an
issue in the trial or to the competence to testify of the subject of the
records, the application should be rejected.  If, on the other hand, the judge
decides that they are likely to be relevant, then the analysis proceeds to the
second stage, which has two parts.  First, the trial judge must balance the
salutary and deleterious effects of ordering the production of the records to
the court for inspection, having regard to the accused's right to make full
answer and defence, and the effect of such production on the privacy and
equality rights of the subject of the records.  If the judge concludes that
production to the court is warranted, he or she should so order.

 

151             The
Chief Justice and Sopinka J. appear to share my view that the balancing of the
effects of production should be undertaken only at this second stage of the
procedure, after the records have been found to be likely relevant.  However,
they contend that the trial judge need not consider competing interests, such
as the privacy rights of the subject of the records, before ordering them
produced to the court for inspection.  This is not my position.  What my
colleagues fail to recognize is that even an order for production to the court
is an invasion of privacy.  The records here in question are profoundly
intimate, and any violation of the intimacy of the records can have serious
consequences for the dignity of the subject of the records and, in some cases,
for the course of his or her therapy.  Neither the subject nor the guardian of
the records should be compelled to violate the intimacy of the records unless
the judge has determined, after careful consideration, that the salutary
effects of doing so outweigh the damage done thereby.  

 








152             In
borderline cases, the judge should err on the side of production to the court. 
The trial judge, in examining the materials, will guard the privacy of the
witness to the best of his or her ability.  Nevertheless, reading and vetting
large quantities of material that have been ordered produced to the court out
of an abundance of caution can impose an excessive burden on judicial
resources, especially if only a small proportion of the records produced to the
court are ultimately produced to the defence.  Consequently, while borderline
cases at this stage should be decided in favour of production to the court, the
determination of relevance and balancing should be meaningful, fair and
considered.  This carefully considered balancing will prevent documents from
being needlessly produced.

 

153             Next,
upon their production to the court, the judge should examine the records to
determine whether, and to what extent, they should be produced to the accused. 
This step requires the court anew, but with the benefit of the inspection of
the documents, to consider the likely relevance and salutary and deleterious
effects as previously but with production to the accused in mind.

 

154             I
have some difficulties with the Court of Appeal's position to the effect that
the judge may simply disclose to the defence any evidence which is
""material"".  The problem with such an approach is that it effectively
does away with any consideration for privacy, or for larger societal
interests.  A fair legal system requires respect at all times for the
complainant's personal dignity, and in particular his or her right to privacy,
equality and security of the person.  As the Chief Justice said in Dagenais,
supra, in the context of a publication ban, the common law should not
accord pre-eminence to the right to a fair trial, over other constitutionally
entrenched rights (at p. 877):

 

The pre-Charter common law
rule governing publication bans emphasized the right to a fair trial over the
free expression interests of those affected by the ban.  In my view, the
balance this rule strikes is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter,
and in particular, the equal status given by the Charter to ss. 2(b)
and 11 (d).  It would be inappropriate for the courts to continue to
apply a common law rule that automatically favoured the rights protected by s.
11 (d) over those protected by s. 2(b).  A hierarchical approach
to rights, which places some over others, must be avoided, both when
interpreting the Charter and when developing the common law.  When the
protected rights of two individuals come into conflict, as can occur in the
case of publication bans, Charter principles require a balance to be
achieved that fully respects the importance of both sets of rights.

 








Similarly, as regards the production of private records held by
third parties, a balance must be struck that places the Charter rights of
complainants on an equal footing with those of accused persons.  

 

155             In
Dagenais, the Court assessed proportionality by examining and weighing
the salutary and deleterious effects of the rights infringements in question. 
I believe that such a process was already implicit in Seaboyer, in which
this Court sought to achieve a measure of proportionality between the right to
privacy and the right to a fair trial.  In my view, an analogous approach is
appropriate in the disclosure context.  Once a court has reviewed the records,
production should only be ordered in respect of those records, or parts of
records, that have significant probative value that is not substantially
outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice
or by the harm to the privacy rights of the witness or to the privileged
relation.  See also Stuesser, ""Reconciling Disclosure and Privilege""
(1994), 30 C.R. (4th) 67, at pp. 71-72.

 








156             Although
this list is not exhaustive, the following factors should be considered in this
determination: (1) the extent to which the record is necessary for the accused
to make full answer and defence; (2) the probative value of the record in
question; (3) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy
vested in that record; (4) whether production of the record would be premised
upon any discriminatory belief or bias; (5) the potential prejudice to the
complainant's dignity, privacy or security of the person that would be
occasioned by production of the record in question; (6) the extent to which
production of records of this nature would frustrate society's interest in
encouraging the reporting of sexual offences and the acquisition of treatment
by victims; and (7) the effect on the integrity of the trial process of
producing, or failing to produce, the record, having in mind the need to
maintain consideration in the outcome.

 

157             According
to the Chief Justice and Sopinka J., society's interest in encouraging victims
of sexual assault to report the offences and to obtain treatment ""is not a
paramount consideration"" (para. 33), and the effect of production on the
integrity of the trial process should not be considered at all, in assessing
whether the guardians of therapeutic records should be compelled to produce
them to the defence.  I can see no reason to reduce the relative importance of
these factors, let alone exclude them, when balancing the salutary and
deleterious effects of a production order.

 

158             This
Court has already recognized that society has a legitimate interest in
encouraging the reporting of sexual assault and that this social interest is
furthered by protecting the privacy of complainants: Seaboyer, supra,
at pp. 605-6.  Parliament, too, has recognized this important interest in s.
276(3) (b) of the Criminal Code .  While Seaboyer and s.
276(3) (b) relate to the admissibility of evidence regarding the past
sexual conduct of the complainant, the same reasoning applies here.  The
compelled production of therapeutic records is a serious invasion of
complainants' privacy which has the potential to deter sexual assault victims
from reporting offences or, if they do report them, from seeking treatment.  

 








159             As
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. observe, measures exist for limiting the extent of
the invasion of privacy associated with a production order.  However, despite
such measures, the compelled production of therapeutic records to the defence
remains a serious violation of the complainant's privacy and a deterrent to the
reporting of offences and the acquisition of treatment.  At the same time, production
may affect the integrity of the trial process.  Judges must carefully weigh
these consequences when deciding whether to make an order for production. 

 

160             As
a further argument in favour of a less onerous burden upon the accused, the
Chief Justice and Sopinka J. compare the accused to a state agent applying for
a search warrant under s. 487(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .  They
state that, by virtue of s. 487(1) (b), ""production of third party
records is always available to the Crown"" (para. 34) where there are
reasonable grounds to believe that evidence will be found.  Because the
interpretation of s. 487(1) (b) is not an issue in this appeal, I will
keep my comments to a minimum.  However, I must disagree with my colleagues'
suggestion that the Crown can always obtain a warrant for production of the
therapeutic records of innocent third parties simply by establishing
""reasonable grounds"".  On the contrary, in a decision penned by the
Chief Justice (then Lamer J.), this Court has held that a judge may refuse a
search warrant, even if the statutory requirement of ""reasonable
grounds"" is met, in order to protect the fundamental rights of innocent
third parties: Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, at pp.
889-91.  Therefore, it should not be assumed that the state could obtain a
warrant in respect of intimate records held by innocent third parties as easily
as the Chief Justice and Sopinka J. now suggest.  Nor, in my view, should the
accused be entitled to compel production of such records without a rigorous
inquiry into the relevance of the records and the salutary and deleterious
effects of compelling their production.

 








161             I
would add that where the defence seeks to justify disclosure on the basis of
anticipated relevance to particular issues, some inquiry is warranted into
whether or not these issues are collateral to the real issues at trial.  Since
the defence cannot pursue inconsistencies on collateral issues, the defence is
really no better off having production on that issue.  It follows that failure
to produce information relating only to collateral issues will not impair the
accused's right to full answer and defence.  See, e.g., R. v. C. (B.)
(1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 467 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Davison, DeRosie and MacArthur
(1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (Ont. C.A.).

 

162             At
the opposite end of the spectrum, where material is found that is essential to
the accused's ability to make full answer and defence, then justice dictates
that this material be produced, even if this information was not argued as a
basis for production by the defence.  However, in some such cases,  sensitivity
to the complainant's privacy rights and security of the person might dictate
that the complainant be given the option of withdrawing from the prosecution
rather than facing production of the records in question.

 








163             In
that vein, where a court concludes that production is warranted, it should only
be made in the manner and to the extent necessary to achieve that objective:  Dagenais,
supra.  The court should not release classes of records, but rather
should inspect each individual record for materiality.  Records that are to be
produced should be vetted with a view to protecting the witness's privacy,
while nonetheless maintaining sufficient detail to make the contents meaningful
to the reader.  The judge may, in certain cases, wish to hear submissions on whether
the vetting of the records should be assisted by counsel for the complainant,
for the guardian of the records, or for the Crown.  It will generally be
appropriate, moreover, to review the records in camera, and to keep the
records sealed and in the custody of the registrar.  Depending upon the
sensitivity of the records, the court should consider prohibiting the making of
any reproductions of those records and imposing a publication ban on such terms
as are deemed appropriate.  In exceptional cases, the court may consider making
an order prohibiting defence counsel from discussing the contents of these
records with the accused.  Finally, I agree with the Court of Appeal that it is
appropriate that all records produced to the court but not ultimately to the
defence be sealed and retained in the file in the event that they should need
to be reviewed later.  These procedures are part and parcel of the process of
ensuring that privacy rights are minimally impaired while nonetheless
furthering the objective of guaranteeing the accused full answer and defence
and a fair trial.

 

(v)   Admissibility

 

164             I
cannot emphasize enough that the guidelines outlined above are clearly not
synonymous with the test for admissibility of evidence at trial, outlined in Seaboyer
and in s. 276 of the Code.  Disclosure and production are broader
concepts than admissibility and, as such, evidence which is produced to the
defence will not necessarily be admissible at trial.  

 

165             Indeed,
in most cases, private records relating to the counselling or treatment of the
complainant will be irrelevant and inadmissible hearsay evidence.  Notes of
statements made by a complainant in a therapeutic context are inherently
unreliable because they are frequently not prepared contemporaneously with the
statements, are not intended to be an accurate record of the statements, and
are not ratified by the complainant.  Moreover, they touch on a variety of
topics not relevant to the issues at trial or the complainant's competence to
testify.  As I have observed earlier in these reasons, there is a real risk
that statements having little or no real relevance may be taken out of context
as a basis for unwarranted inferences.

 








166             In
any event, the admissibility of the records as evidence must be determined if
and when the accused seeks to introduce them.  The fact that records have been
ordered produced to the defence does not mean that the records are necessarily
admissible.

 

167             I
now turn to the last issue argued before this Court, which is the question of
the proper forum for an application for production, and the timing of such an
application.

 

(vi)  Forum and Timing

 

(a)   Preliminary Inquiry

 

168             In
Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, this Court stated that the
powers of a preliminary inquiry judge are only those conferred either expressly
by statute or by necessary implication.  Since there is no explicit statutory
authority for an order requiring third parties to produce private records to
the defence at a preliminary inquiry, the power to make such an order, if it
exists, must be necessarily incidental to some other statutory power.  

 








169             The
primary function of the preliminary inquiry, which is clearly set out in s.
548(1) of the Code, is undoubtedly to ascertain that the Crown has
sufficient evidence to commit the accused to trial. See also Caccamo v. The
Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786.  Over time, however, the preliminary inquiry
appears to have taken upon itself an ancillary purpose, which is to afford the
accused an opportunity to discover and appreciate the case to be made against
him at trial:  Skogman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93.  This
judicially inspired expansion of the nature and ambit of the preliminary
inquiry has been attributed by learned commentators to the historical lack of
any formal, institutionalized procedures by which an accused could obtain full
and effective disclosure of the Crown's case.  (See Re Regina and Arviv
(1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 395 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 403, per Martin J.A.,
leave to appeal refused, [1985] 1 S.C.R. v.)

 

170             Although
preliminary inquiry judges are not permitted to determine the credibility of
witnesses, one might hazard to say that the ancillary purpose of
""discovery"" has lately begun to eclipse the primary purpose of
sparing the accused the gross indignity of being placed on trial in
circumstances where there is simply insufficient evidence to justify holding
the trial at all.  One provincial court judge, in the course of a thoughtful
discussion on the evolving role of the preliminary inquiry, recently expressed
great frustration with this apparent turn of events:

 

...the preliminary hearing or preliminary inquiry has
been turned into a nightmarish experience for any provincial court judge. 
Rules with respect to relevancy have been widened beyond recognition. 
Cross-examination at a preliminary inquiry now seems to have no limits. 
Attempts by provincial court judges to limit cross-examination have been perceived
by some superior courts as a breach of the accused's right to fundamental
justice, a breach of his or her ability to be able to make full answer and
defence.

 

The present state of the
preliminary inquiry is akin to a rudderless ship on choppy waters.  The
preliminary hearing has been turned into a free-for-all, a living hell for
victims of crime and witnesses who are called to take part in this archaic
ritual.

 

(R. v. Darby, [1994] B.C.J. No. 814 (Prov.
Ct.), at paras. 9 and 10.)

 








171             Nevertheless,
the ""discovery"" aspect of the preliminary inquiry remains, at most,
an incidental aspect of what is in essence an inquiry into whether the Crown's
evidence is sufficient to warrant the committal of the accused to trial.  We
must also recognize that the law of disclosure in Canada changed significantly
as a result of this Court's decision in Stinchcombe, supra.  Stinchcombe
recognized that a rigorous duty exists on the Crown to disclose to the defence
all information in its possession, both inculpatory and exculpatory, which is
not clearly irrelevant or privileged.  While the Crown retains a discretion as
to what is ""clearly irrelevant"", this discretion is reviewable by the
trial judge at the instance of the defence.  In short, Stinchcombe
marked the dawn of a new era in disclosure to the defence, by transforming a
professional courtesy into a formal obligation.  Failure by the Crown to comply
with this obligation may, particularly when motivated by an intention to
withhold relevant information, result in the drastic remedy of a stay of
proceedings.  Consequently, in light of Stinchcombe and other decisions
of this Court that have elaborated on those disclosure guidelines (R. v.
Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451; Chaplin, supra), it may be
necessary to reassess the extent to which the ""discovery"" rationale
remains appropriate as a consideration in the conduct of the modern-day
preliminary inquiry.

 

172             The
more limited question for the purposes of this appeal, however, is whether the
judge at a preliminary inquiry may consider applications for production of
private records held by third parties. 

 








173             It
is beyond doubt that the statutory powers of a preliminary inquiry judge
include the power to order witnesses to give evidence.  Section 545 of the Code,
for example, contemplates that a preliminary inquiry judge may require a
witness to produce documents.  However, the jurisdiction of a judge at a
preliminary inquiry must be interpreted in light of the essential purpose of
the inquiry, which is to assess whether the Crown has sufficient evidence to
warrant committing the accused to trial.  The preliminary inquiry judge does
not have the power to inquire into other matters, or to order the production of
documents which are not related to this assessment.

 

174             In
Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, for instance, this Court held
that a preliminary inquiry judge had no power to compel production of a
statement made to police by a prosecution witness.  It is apparent that the
Court was of the view that production of such a statement was not related to
the purpose of the preliminary inquiry.  On behalf of the majority, Judson J.
stated (at p. 412):

 

The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is clearly
defined by the Criminal Code  -- to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to put the accused on trial.  It is not a trial and should not be
allowed to become a trial.  We are not concerned here with the power of a trial
judge to compel production during the trial nor with the extent to which the
prosecution, in fairness to an accused person, ought to make production after
the preliminary hearing and before trial.

 

 

(See also Re Hislop and The Queen (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 240
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1983] 2 S.C.R. viii.)  Similarly, I do
not see how private records in the hands of third parties could ever be
relevant to the issues at a preliminary inquiry.  

 








175             In
addition, it is crucial not to lose sight of the fundamental rationale for
allowing an accused to obtain production of private records.  The records are
not part of the Crown's case against the accused; consequently, the purpose of

            The respondent was charged
with indecently assaulting L.L.A. who, at the time of the alleged incidents,
was a child.  Before the trial was scheduled to begin, the respondent served
subpoenas duces tecum on the institutional appellants commanding them to
bring to court all records relating to the proceedings and to the appellant
L.L.A.  At the same time, the respondent served the institutional appellants
and the Crown with a notice of motion for an order that the institutional
appellants produce to the defence, before the scheduled trial date, all records
relating to L.L.A.  The motion was adjourned to be dealt with by the trial
judge on the scheduled date for the trial to begin.  Before that date, the
Crown served and filed a notice of application for an order quashing the
subpoenas.

 

            The trial judge dismissed
the Crown's application to quash the subpoenas.  He concluded, with respect to
the application for production, that the records were not privileged and
ordered that all records sought be produced to the respondent, with the
condition that no copies be made.  He then granted an adjournment to allow the
parties to assess their respective positions.  Given the appellants' intention
to appeal the order for production, a stay of the order was granted until such
time as the appeals were disposed of.  The appellants filed notices of appeal
and the respondent brought applications to quash them.  The Court of Appeal
quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction in a unanimous decision.  It held
that the appellants had no right to appeal to the Court of Appeal until there
had been a final verdict at trial.  As a result, the Court of Appeal ordered the
production of the documents and directed that the trial proceed.  Pursuant to
s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act , the appellants applied for leave
to appeal to this Court from the trial judge's order for the production of the
documents.  They also applied for a stay of the trial pending this Court's
decision on their appeal.  This Court remitted the question of the stay to the
trial judge and granted the application for leave to appeal.

 

            This appeal raises two
issues.  The first issue is whether third parties, here the appellants, can
appeal a trial judge's interlocutory ruling in a sexual assault criminal
proceeding.  As such, it is necessary to determine whether this Court has
jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.  The second issue deals with the nature
and extent of production to the defence of medical and therapeutic records
relating to complainants held by third parties in sexual assault trials.

 

            Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

Jurisdiction

 

            Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Major JJ.:  Different procedural
avenues exist for third parties seeking to appeal an interlocutory order
depending on the level of court issuing the order.  A provincial court order is
to be challenged through an enlarged remedy of certiorari which falls
within the ambit of superior courts.  This decision can then be appealed
through the regular channels of the judicial system.  Where a court order is
issued by a superior court judge, third parties can challenge it by seeking leave
to appeal directly to this Court, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme
Court Act .

 

            The appellants, who are
third parties in the criminal proceeding, have standing to appeal before this
Court.  The full scope of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act 
provides for an appeal not only of a ""final judgment"" but also of
""other judgment[s]"" and therefore encompasses interlocutory appeals
of court orders in criminal matters sought by third parties.  Furthermore, an
interlocutory order affecting third parties is a final order and, accordingly,
s. 40(1)  is available to appeal an order of a superior court judge. 
Finally, s. 2(1) of the Supreme Court Act , in its definition of
""final judgment"", uses the term ""any of the parties in
controversy"" rather than any of the parties in the proceedings.  Third
parties' substantive rights might be affected by the outcome of the trial
judge's order; they are ""parties in controversy"" before the Court.

 

            While the dismissal by the
trial judge of a motion to quash the subpoenas may not open the door to an
interlocutory appeal of that order by parties to the proceedings during the
trial, the records here subpoenaed were not in the possession of the Crown but
in that of third parties.  The parties who seek to appeal the order are third
parties, not the Crown.  No appeal lay to the Court of Appeal but an appeal by
third parties did lie to this Court, with leave.  Given that this procedure was
followed, this Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  The complainant, a
third party to the proceedings (whether or not an appellant), and the Crown, a
party to the proceedings, both have standing in third party appeals.  The audi
alteram partem principle requires that courts provide an opportunity to be
heard to those who will be affected by the decisions.

 

Production of Medical Records held by Third Parties

 

            Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory and
Major JJ.:  The procedure and substantive law to be followed where the
accused seeks the production of therapeutic records in the hands of third parties
is set out in R. v. O'Connor.  The appeal must be allowed as respondent
failed to follow the requisite procedure and substantive law but without
prejudice to his right to renew his request for production via the procedures
developed by this Court in O'Connor.

 

            Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ.:  Private records, or records in which a reasonable
expectation of privacy lies, may include medical or therapeutic records, school
records, private diaries, social worker activity logs, and so on.  

 

            A class privilege should
not be recognized for private records.  Privilege exempts, completely or
partially, particular communications arising out of certain defined
relationships from disclosure in judicial proceedings.  Although the
justification for privilege has traditionally been utilitarian, a view based on
fundamental individual values, such as privacy, has recently begun to emerge. 
Nevertheless, privilege is a question of public policy, as it impedes the
search for truth, a central objective of our legal system, in order to advance
other goals.  Notwithstanding several strong arguments of public policy
militating in favour of protecting the confidentiality of counsellor-sexual
assault complainant communications in criminal trials, a class privilege should
not be recognized for private records.  The following concerns weigh against
the recognition of such a privilege: (1) the truth-finding process of our
adversarial trial procedure; (2) the possible relevance of some private
records; (3) the accused's right to make full answer and defence; (4) the
categories of actors included in a class privilege; and (5) the experience of
other countries.

 

            The granting of a
case-by-case privilege may be appropriate in some circumstances.  Given the
nature of the relationship between counsellors and sexual assault complainants,
the first three Wigmore criteria will usually be easily met.  These
relationships are founded on trust and confidence, confidentiality is essential
to their maintenance, and the public fosters and supports the relationships. 
The fourth criterion involves the balancing of the relative values favouring
privilege with those favouring production of the records.  The determination of
whether privilege should be granted in a particular case is based on public
policy considerations, as distinct from a balancing of Charter  rights. 
While a case-by-case privilege for private records of sexual assault
complainants may be recognized in some instances, exceptions to the general
evidentiary rule of admissibility and disclosure should not be encouraged. 
Moreover, this ad hoc approach to privilege will not cure the most
important ills associated with production of private records, notably the
deterrent effect that such production has on reporting and counselling.

 

                        A better
approach is that advocated in R. v. O'Connor, involving a balancing of
the sexual assault complainant's Charter  rights to privacy and equality
with the accused's Charter  rights to a fair trial and to full answer and
defence.  

 

                        When deciding
whether to order production of private records held by third parties, the court
must exercise its discretion in a manner that is respectful of Charter 
values.  The constitutional values involved here are the right to full answer
and defence, the right to privacy, and the right to equality without
discrimination.  

 

                        The use of
state power to compel production of private records will be justified in a free
and democratic society when the following criteria are met: (1) it is shown
that the accused cannot obtain the information by any other reasonable means;
(2) production that infringes privacy must be limited as reasonably as possible
to fulfil the right to make full answer and defence; (3) the arguments urging
production rest on permissible chains of reasoning, rather than discriminatory
assumptions and stereotypes; and (4) there is proportionality between the
salutary and deleterious effects of production.  The common law should not
accord pre-eminence to the right to a fair trial, over other constitutionally
protected rights.  A balance must be struck that places the Charter 
rights of complainants on an equal footing with those of accused persons.

 

                        The first step
for an accused who seeks production of private records held by a third party is
to obtain and serve on the third party a subpoena duces tecum.  The
Crown, the subject of the records, and any other person with an interest in the
confidentiality of the records should be notified at this time that the accused
will be seeking an order for production of the records.  

 

                        At the trial,
when the accused requests an order for production of the records, the judge
should follow a two-stage approach.  First, the accused must demonstrate that
the information contained in the records is likely relevant either to an issue
in the proceedings or to the competence to testify of the subject of the
records.  Although the subject's privacy interest does not enter into
consideration at this stage, the information must be sought because of its
relevance, rather than for illegitimate purposes.  Moreover, the accused's
demonstration of likely relevance must be based on evidence, not on speculative
assertions or on discriminatory or stereotypical reasoning.  It may be useful
at this stage for the third party to prepare a list of the records in its
possession. 

 

            If the court is satisfied
that the information is likely to be relevant, then the analysis proceeds to
the second stage, which has two parts.  First, if the accused can show that the
salutary effects of producing the documents to the court for inspection
outweigh the deleterious effects of such production, the judge should so
order.  Then, after examining the records, the judge should balance the
conflicting constitutional rights to determine whether and to what extent
production to the defence should be ordered.  Only those parts of records that
have a significant probative value to the issues at trial or the competence of
the witness which is not substantially outweighed by prejudice to the
administration of justice or to the witness' privacy and equality rights should
be produced.

 

            Even if production is
ordered, it must still be determined whether the produced records are
admissible.

 

            The court's inquiry into
the relevance of the information and its balancing of the competing interests
should be made at the time of the trial.  Prospective defence witnesses in
sexual assault cases, like other potential witnesses in criminal cases, are not
obliged to cooperate with either party before the trial, and may not be
compelled to provide the defence with a preview of their evidence.  Private
records of this kind will in most cases be irrelevant and inadmissible. 
Moreover, the creation of a pre-trial procedure would inconvenience witnesses,
invite fishing expeditions and entail unnecessary delays.  Finally, the trial
judge would not be in a position, before the beginning of the trial, to
determine the relevance, much less the admissibility, of the records sought, or
to balance effectively the constitutional rights affected by an order for
production.

 

                        In this case,
the respondent's application for production should not have been entertained
before the beginning of the trial.  Moreover, no notice was given to L.L.A. who
had an interest in the confidentiality of the records.  As well, the trial
judge erred by ordering the records produced without first determining their
likely relevance and balancing the competing Charter  rights. 
Ultimately, the respondent's application could not meet the threshold of likely
relevance either to the issues at trial or to the competence of the subject of
the records, and constituted nothing more than a fishing expedition.

            The judgment of Lamer C.J.
and Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

1          Lamer
C.J. and Sopinka J. -- This appeal, along with the companion case of R.
v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, released concurrently, concerns the
procedure and substantive law governing the production of sexual assault
counselling records in the possession of third parties.  In addition, the
present appeal raises the issue of this Court's jurisdiction to entertain a
third party's appeal from a trial judge's interlocutory ruling in a sexual
assault trial.  On this latter issue, we agree with the decision of our
colleague Justice L'Heureux-Dubé.

 

2          Our views concerning the procedure and
substantive law to be followed where the accused seeks the production of
therapeutic records in the hands of third parties are set out in our reasons in
O'Connor.  As the respondent in the instant case has failed to follow
the requisite procedure and substantive law, we agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J.
that the appeal must be allowed.  However, we wish to make it clear that in
allowing this appeal, we do not prejudice the right of the respondent to renew
his request for production via the procedure and substantive law developed by
this Court in O'Connor.

 

            The reasons of
La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

3                      L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- This appeal raises two issues.  The first issue is a
jurisdictional question as to whether third parties, here the appellants, can
appeal a trial judge's interlocutory ruling in a sexual assault criminal proceeding. 
As such, it is necessary to determine whether this Court has jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal.  The second issue is substantive in character and deals
with the nature and extent of production to the defence of medical and
therapeutic records relating to complainants held by third parties in sexual
assault trials.

 

4                      Several fundamental values
are at stake in this appeal: the right to full answer and defence, the right to
privacy and the right to equality without discrimination.

 

5                      At the outset, a reference
to the relevant statutory provisions and a review of the facts and judgments
are in order.

 

I.          Relevant Statutory
Provisions

 

6                      The jurisdictional issue
concerns the application of s. 40(1)  and the definition of ""final
judgment"" in s. 2(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.
S-26 .  These provisions read as follows:

 

               2.      (1)...

 

""final
judgment""  means any judgment, rule, order or decision that determines in
whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in
any judicial proceeding;

 

   40.    
(1)  Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any
final or other judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal or of the highest court
of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had
in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or
not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court,
where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme
Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its
public importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed
law and fact involved in that question, one that ought to be decided by the
Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as
to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from that judgment is
accordingly granted by the Supreme Court.

 

II.         Facts and Judgments

 

7                      On March 2, 1993, the
respondent A.B. was arrested and charged that, between February 15, 1980, and
December 31, 1980, in Sault Ste. Marie, he indecently assaulted the appellant
L.L.A., then six years of age, contrary to s. 140 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 151 ).

 

8                      L.L.A. sought counselling
at both appellant counselling institutions.  The appellant Sexual Assault Care
Centre of the Plummer Memorial Public Hospital is a division of the public
hospital at which L.L.A. attended for counselling in January, 1992.  The
appellant Women in Crisis (Algoma) Inc., operating as ""Women's
Outreach"", is a partially publicly funded organization where L.L.A. sought
counselling in November, 1992.  It provides counselling to adult women who are
victims/survivors of sexual abuse, sexual assault, family violence and other
types of violence against women.

 

9                      At the preliminary inquiry
on June 2, 1993, the respondent was committed to stand trial.  The trial was
scheduled to start on February 14, 1994.  On February 3, 1994, the respondent
served subpoenas duces tecum on the appellants Sexual Assault Care
Centre and Women's Outreach, commanding them to bring to court, on February 14,
1994, all records relating to the proceedings and to the appellant L.L.A.  At
the same time, the respondent served the appellants Sexual Assault Care Centre
and Women's Outreach as well as the Crown with a notice of motion for an order
that the appellants Sexual Assault Care Centre and Women's Outreach produce to
the defence, before the scheduled trial date, all records relating to the
appellant L.L.A.  The motion came before Whalen J. on February 9, 1994, and was
adjourned to be dealt with by the trial judge on February 14.  On February 10,
1994, the Crown served and filed a notice of application for an order quashing
the subpoenas.

 

10                    On February 14, 1994,
Loukidelis J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division, heard both
applications separately.  He dealt first with the application from the Crown to
quash the subpoenas, which he dismissed, concluding that ""there may be information
at hand that is relevant to the issue"".  Loukidelis J. then heard the
motion from the respondent for production of the records.  He held:

 

In
view of the way that these matters were brought before me, the issue is not
whether this is a fishing expedition because that is an issue of a bona fide
need for the evidence which was subsumed under the question of relevance.  This
argument advances the issue of privilege.

 

Loukidelis J. observed that there was
no statutory basis for the claim of privilege and that the traditional classes
of privilege created by the common law, such as the solicitor-client privilege,
were not applicable.  He concluded that the records were not privileged and
ordered that all records sought be produced to the respondent, subject to the
condition that no copies be made.  He then granted an adjournment to allow the
parties to assess their respective positions.  Given the appellants' intention
to appeal the order for production, Loukidelis J. ordered a stay of his order
until the appeals were disposed of.  The appellants filed notices of appeal on
March 17, 1994, at which time the respondent brought applications to quash the
appeals.

 

11                    On January 6, 1995, the
Ontario Court of Appeal quashed the appeal for want of jurisdiction in a
unanimous decision (A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.) (1995), 37 C.R. (4th) 170). 
Relying upon the decision of this Court in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting
Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was no
provision under the Code allowing for interlocutory appeals either for
parties or third parties from rulings at trial relating to the admissibility of
evidence or documents.  As such, it held that the appellants had no right to
appeal to the Court of Appeal until there had been a final verdict at trial. 
As a result, the Court of Appeal ordered the production of the documents and
directed that the trial before Loukidelis J. proceed.

 

12                    Pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme
Court Act , the appellants applied for leave to appeal to this Court from
Loukidelis J.'s order for the production of the documents.  They also applied
for a stay of the trial pending this Court's decision on their appeal.   The
trial date was set for June 5, 1995.  On March 17, 1995, this Court remitted
the question of the stay to the trial judge and, on March 27, the application
for leave to appeal was granted: [1995] 1 S.C.R. viii.

 

III.Arguments
of the Parties and the Interveners

 

13                    A number of issues were
raised by the parties and the interveners, which I will attempt to summarize
without entering into all the detailed approaches which were suggested.

 

14                    The appellants submit, first,
that the threshold evidentiary basis, which must be established by the
accused's seeking the production of private records held by third parties, must
take into consideration the right to privacy of the complainant as guaranteed
in ss. 7  and 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
Accordingly, the initial burden would rest upon the accused to establish that
the records are necessary for full answer and defence.  The relevance of
the records would have to be clearly established and a substantial foundation
would have to be laid by material extraneous to the records themselves, the
subject of records and the record holder.  Secondly, the appellants submit that
a common law privilege exists in favour of private records held by third
parties and that, in balancing both the right of the accused to a full defence
and the privacy right of the complainant, such records should be held
privileged.

 

15                    The respondent's first
contention is to the effect that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear
third party interlocutory appeals arising out of sexual assault criminal
proceedings.  As to the question of production and disclosure, the respondent
starts from the proposition that the principles elaborated in R. v.
Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, with respect to documents in the
possession of the Crown should apply to documents in the possession of third
parties.  Consequently, whenever the records at issue may be useful to the
defence, disclosure should be the rule.  According to the respondent, the privacy
interest of sexual assault complainants in records held by third parties is not
protected by the Charter.  Therefore, there are no conflicting
constitutional rights and the accused's right to full answer and defence must
prevail.  After the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum for the
production of such private records, the respondent asserts that the onus is on
the Crown to show that the documents are clearly irrelevant.  In his
supplementary factum, the respondent argues that there is no infringement of s.
15  of the Charter  in the case at hand.  With regard to privilege, the
respondent argues that the onus of establishing the existence of a privilege
rests upon the party opposing production and disclosure.  Further, no privilege
would exist because the traditional rules of confidentiality are trumped by the
right of the accused to make full answer and defence.

 

16                    The intervener Criminal
Lawyers Association (""CLA"") agrees with the respondent that the Stinchcombe
disclosure principles apply for the production and disclosure of private
records held by third parties.  CLA submits that the accused must have all
available tools in order to exercise his right to make full answer and defence,
including all potentially relevant information.  According to CLA, the Charter
is not engaged by the disclosure of private records held by third parties. 
Concerning privilege, CLA argues that, in weighing the complainant's privacy
interest with the accused's right to make full answer and defence, the balance
must be struck in favour of the latter.

 

 

17                    On behalf of the intervener
Crown, the Attorney General of Ontario asserts that the proper procedure in the
present case consists in the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum coupled
with a formal application for production of the records, including stated
grounds and supporting materials.  As to the onus, it would be up to the
defence to demonstrate, through evidence, that disclosure is necessary in order
to make full answer and defence, as well as to establish a substantial
likelihood that, without the court compelled infringement of the
complainant's ss. 7 , 8  and 15  Charter  rights, the accused's right to
make full answer and defence at trial would be violated.  The evaluation of the
relevance and probative value of the private records should be based on a
factual foundation, within the context of the trial as a whole and in light of Charter
values.  With regard to privilege, the Attorney General of Ontario endorses the
appellants' position that the private records in this case are protected by a
class privilege.  Alternatively, the proper application of the four Wigmore
criteria leads to the conclusion that this is an appropriate case for finding a
case-by-case privilege.

 

18                    The intervener Attorney
General of Canada takes the position that the proper approach to the production
of private records held by third parties should balance the rights of the
accused to make full answer and defence with the rights of the complainant to
security of the person, privacy and equality.  The procedure would be initiated
by subpoena duces tecum and the threshold test would be the likely
materiality of the records, i.e., that they are capable of affecting the
outcome of the trial.  Likely materiality must be determined with regard to the
purpose to which the evidence is put and must be based on a proper factual
foundation.  Hypothetical allegations based on erroneous assumptions informed
by stereotypes and myths would be inappropriate and unfair to sexual assault
complainants.  The Attorney General of Canada further submits that the
communications between sexual assault complainants and their counsellors enjoy
a class privilege similar to solicitor-client communications.  In the
alternative, private records of sexual assault complainants are protected by a
case-by-case privilege.

 

19                    The intervener Attorney
General of Manitoba submits that trial judges do not have jurisdiction to make
pre-trial orders for the production of private records held by third parties. 
The subpoena procedure could only be used in order to have witnesses attend
court to give evidence and not as a means of pre-trial discovery.  As to the
onus, the applicant seeking disclosure would have to establish that such
records are likely to be necessary and useful for full answer and
defence.  In undertaking this exercise, the court would have to weigh the
potential value of such records for ensuring the accused's full answer and defence
against the prejudicial effect of disclosure.  According to the Attorney
General of Manitoba, no class privilege exists in favour of private records
held by third parties but a case-by-case privilege may exist if Wigmore's four
criteria are met.

 

20                    The intervener Canadian
Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law (""CFCYL"") favours a
consideration of the complainant's Charter right to privacy in the
determination of the relevance of private records held by third parties.  In
the CFCYL's opinion, the right to privacy is broader than the privilege under
the fourfold Wigmore test.  This privacy interest must be weighed against the
right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  The threshold should be
the rational or likely connection between the private records requested
and the defence being raised by the accused.  If the defence satisfies this
threshold, the onus falls on the complainant to demonstrate an expectation of
privacy or a common law privilege, to be weighed and reconciled with the
accused's right to make full answer and defence.

 

21                    The interveners Aboriginal
Women's Council et al. (the ""Coalition""), for their part, are
of the view that, in the context of a sex-unequal legal and social culture,
disclosure of sexual assault complainants' private records involves a balancing
not only of the right to privacy and the right to make full answer and defence,
but also of the right to equality without discrimination.  The Coalition
submits that disclosure of private records relating to sexual assault
complainants would aggravate women's inequality by perpetuating the
discriminatory stereotyping and discrediting of women.  Further, disclosure of
private records would undermine the integrity of the justice system by
deterring reporting of sexual assaults and distorting the fact-finding
process.  As a consequence, the vindication of complainants' constitutional
rights and the interests of justice can only be achieved by an absolute
prohibition against the production of complainants' private records in sexual
offence proceedings.

 

IV.       Jurisdiction

 

22                    The first issue raised in
this appeal concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the present appeal,
which the respondent puts into question.  The narrow issue is whether and how
sexual assault complainants and other third parties can appeal an interlocutory
order for the production of private records.  A larger question is whether and
how third parties can challenge interlocutory court orders arising out of
criminal proceedings.  This Court addressed this larger question in Dagenais,
supra, and recently applied the approach developed in that case in R.
v. Primeau, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 60; and R. v. Jobin, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 78.

 

23                    In Dagenais, this
Court had to decide whether the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a third
party to a criminal proceeding, could challenge the interlocutory broadcast ban
of the mini-series ""The Boys of St. Vincent"".  The majority, by which
I am bound, set out two distinct appeal routes from orders made in criminal
proceedings depending on whether the appeal is sought by a party to the
proceedings or by third parties.  In the former situation, the accused and the
Crown must await the end of the trial to appeal such orders.  In the case of
third parties, they can appeal court orders affecting them before the end of
the trial through two procedural avenues.  In Primeau, Sopinka and
Iacobucci JJ., writing for the majority, outlined the rationale for appeals of
interlocutory orders by third parties (at para. 12):

 

            The
procedure for third parties differs for two reasons.  First, a third party,
being outside the actual proceedings, cannot apply to the trial judge for
relief.  Second, an order deciding an issue with respect to a third party is a
final order.  Such a characterization is important in order to comply with the
general rule barring interlocutory appeals in criminal matters.

 

24                    Third parties must follow a
different procedural avenue depending on the level of court that issued the
order being appealed.  A provincial court order is to be challenged through an
enlarged remedy of certiorari, which falls within the ambit of superior
courts.  This decision can then be appealed through the regular channels of our
judicial system.  On the other hand, where a court order is issued by a
superior court judge in the first place, as in the present case, third parties
can challenge it by seeking leave to appeal directly to this Court, pursuant to
s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  These procedures were outlined in Dagenais
with regard to publication bans but, as was pointed out in Primeau and Jobin,
they generally apply to other court orders related to criminal proceedings.  As
a result, the proper procedure to appeal the interlocutory order for production
of records issued by Loukidelis J., a superior court judge, was through leave
to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .

 

25                    The respondent attempts to
argue that because the term ""final judgment"" is defined in s. 2(1)  of
the Supreme Court Act  as being ""any judgment, rule, order or
decision that determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of
the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding"", the appellants,
who are third parties in the criminal proceeding, do not have standing to
appeal before this Court.  With respect, this argument does not take into
account the full scope of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  as
interpreted by this Court in Dagenais.  The section provides for an
appeal not only of a ""final"" judgment but also of ""other
judgment[s]"".  This, in the opinion of the Court, encompasses
interlocutory appeals of court orders in criminal matters sought by third
parties (see Dagenais, at p. 861).  Furthermore, the majority of this
Court in Primeau and Jobin expressed the view that an
interlocutory order affecting third parties is a final order and,
accordingly, s. 40(1)  is available to appeal an order of a superior court
judge, such as the one at issue.  Finally, it is worth noting that s. 2(1)  of
the Supreme Court Act  uses the terms ""any of the parties in
controversy"" rather than any of the parties in the proceedings.  There is
no doubt that third parties' substantive rights might be affected by the
outcome of the trial judge's order.  They are ""parties in
controversy"" before the Court.

 

26                    The respondent further argues
that the Dagenais line of cases is distinguishable on the ground that,
in the case at bar, it was the Crown, a party to the proceedings, not third
parties, who brought the original application to quash the subpoenas before the
trial judge.  In the respondent's view, this is significant because in Dagenais,
Primeau and Jobin the majority of this Court did not allow for
interlocutory appeals in criminal matters by parties to the proceedings.  While
the dismissal by the trial judge of a motion to quash the subpoenas may not
open the door to an interlocutory appeal of that order by parties to the
proceedings during the trial, the records here subpoenaed were not in the
possession of the Crown but in that of third parties.  The parties who seek to
appeal the order are third parties, not the Crown.  According to Dagenais,
no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, which rightly declined jurisdiction, but
an appeal by third parties lies to this Court, with leave from the Court. 
Since this is the procedure followed by the third party appellants in this
case, I must, therefore, conclude that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the
appeal.

 

27                    The one question that remains
is whether both a complainant, a third party to the proceedings (whether or not
an appellant, but here one of the appellants), and the Crown, a party to the
proceedings, have standing in third party appeals.  There is no doubt in my
mind that they do.  The audi alteram partem principle, which is a rule
of natural justice and one of the tenets of our legal system, requires that
courts provide an opportunity to be heard to those who will be affected by the
decisions.  The rules of natural justice or of procedural fairness are most
often discussed in the context of judicial review of the decisions of
administrative bodies, but they were originally developed in the criminal law
context.  In Blackstone's Criminal Practice (Murphy rev. 1993), the
authors remark at p. 1529:

 

Traditionally,
the rules of natural justice have been defined with a little more precision,
and are said to involve two main principles - no man may be a judge in his own
cause, and the tribunal must hear both sides of the case.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

See Forsythe v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 268; and Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 305.

 

28                    Here, both the complainant
and the Crown possess a direct and necessary interest in making representations. 
Both would be directly affected by a decision regarding the production of the
complainant's private records.  The decision is susceptible of affecting the
course of the criminal trial.  Both, therefore, must be afforded an opportunity
to be heard.

 

29                    The respondent's argument on
this first issue must accordingly be dismissed.

 

30                    I now turn to the second
issue of the extent of production of private records in the possession of third
parties.  In that regard, the claim by the appellants and the interveners that
those records are privileged must first be addressed.

 

V.Privilege

 

31                    At the outset, it is useful
to determine what is to be understood by private records.  The context in which
the question of production of private records not in the possession of the
Crown generally arises is not limited to medical and therapeutic records of
complainants in sexual assault cases.  It extends generally to any record, in
the hands of a third party, in which a reasonable expectation of privacy lies. 
These records may include medical or therapeutic records, school records,
private diaries, social worker activity logs and so on.  For the sake of
convenience, I refer to such documents as ""private records held by third
parties"".

 

32                    The appellants and the
interveners who favour recognizing a class privilege at common law for
communications between counsellors and sexual assault complainants invoke
several arguments in support of their view.  Before addressing each of them,
however, a brief reference to the principles and rationales for privilege as
well as a review of the law of privilege in Canada and in other common law
countries are in order.

 

A.Principles
and Rationales

 

33                    The doctrine of privilege
acts as an exception to the truth-finding process of our adversarial trial
procedure.  Although all relevant information is presumptively admissible at
trial, some probative and trustworthy evidence will be excluded to serve other
overriding social interests.  The same principles apply  to exempt, completely
or partially, particular communications arising out of certain defined
relationships from disclosure in judicial proceedings.  Since the existence of
privilege impedes the realization of the central objective of our legal system
in order to advance other goals, the question of privilege is essentially one
of public policy.

 

34                    Traditionally, the
justification for the law of privilege has been based on utilitarian (or
""instrumental"") considerations.  Essentially, this rationale asserts
that communications made within a given relationship should be privileged only
if the benefit derived from protecting the relationship outweighs the
detrimental effects of privilege on the search for the truth.  The utilitarian
theory of privilege focuses on the societal importance of certain
relationships.  Maxine H. Neuhauser, in ""The Privilege of Confidentiality
and Rape Crisis Counselors"" (1985), 8 Women's Rts. L. Rep. 185,
remarks at p. 188:

 

It [the
utilitarian rationale] is based on the notion that if people fear that their
confidences may be revealed in court they will choose not to form particular,
valued relationships or will fail to communicate information necessary to the
fostering of these relationships, and that, consequently, society will suffer.

 

See also, Robert Weisberg, ""Defendant
v. Witness: Measuring Confrontation and Compulsory Process Rights Against
Statutory Communications Privileges"" (1978), 30 Stan. L. Rev. 935,
at pp. 940-42.

 

35                    More recently, an additional
rationale based on privacy has emerged to justify the recognition of privileged
communications (see Charles T. McCormick, McCormick on Evidence (4th ed.
1992), vol. 1, at §§ 72 and 77; also R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 263,
at pp. 302-3, per L'Heureux-Dubé J., concurring).  This non-utilitarian
view is founded on more abstract premises, for example, that privilege is vital
to the protection of fundamental individual values.  In ""Developments in the
Law -- Privileged Communications"" (1985), 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450,
the authors observe at pp. 1480-81:

 

Rather
than focusing on the systemic impact that compelled disclosures might have on
behavior, the privacy rationale focuses on the protection that privileges
afford to individual privacy.  The confidentiality of communications is
regarded as a privacy interest that itself justifies whatever impairment of
truth-seeking that privileges may cause.

 

In the context of counsellor and
sexual assault complainant communications, Anna Y. Joo, in ""Broadening the
Scope of Counselor-Patient Privilege to Protect the Privacy of the Sexual
Assault Survivor"" (1995), 32 Harv. J. on Legis. 255, makes these
observations, at p. 260:

 

            Whereas
the utilitarian rationale views the goal of the counselor-patient privilege as
promoting beneficial future relations, the privacy justification perceives the
main purpose of the privilege as shielding the patient from the harm that
disclosure may cause.  According to the privacy justification, some human
relationships are fundamental to human dignity and should be free from state
interference.  [Emphasis added.]

 

See also, Stephen A. Saltzburg,
""Privileges and Professionals: Lawyers and Psychiatrists"" (1980), 66 Va.
L. Rev. 597, at pp. 621-22.

 

36                    It is useful at this stage to
review briefly how the law of privilege has developed so far in Canada, as well
as in other common law countries, particularly as regards the issue now before
the Court.

 

B.A
Comparative View

 

37                    In Canada, very few
communications are recognized as privileged either at common law or under
statutory law.  At common law, the solicitor-client privilege as well as the
informer privilege are fully recognized.  These privileges are not absolute
however; they must yield, in some circumstances, to the accused's right to make
full answer and defence.  For example, in R. v. Seaboyer,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 607, McLachlin J., speaking for the majority of the
Court, held that informer privilege and solicitor-client privilege may yield in
the context of a criminal trial if the accused's innocence is at stake. 
Similarly, in Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 340, Sopinka J. noted
that existing privileges may, in certain circumstances, constitute unreasonable
limits on the constitutional right to make full answer and defence.  See also
Loretta N. Colton, ""R. v. Stinchcombe: Defining
Disclosure"" (1995), 40 McGill L.J. 525, at p. 556.

 

38                    By statute, as regards
criminal law, communications between spouses are the only ones regarded as
privileged (s. 4(3)  of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 ;
see R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, regarding separated spouses
without any reasonable possibility of reconciliation).  Similarly, provincial
legislation generally provides for spousal communications privilege in civil
proceedings.  Two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Newfoundland, have enacted
statutes recognizing religious communications privilege: see Quebec's Charter
of Human Rights and Freedoms, R.S.Q. 1977, c. C-12, s. 9; and
Newfoundland's Evidence Act, R.S.N. 1970, c. 115, s. 6.  With regard to
doctor-patient relationships, Quebec is the only province which has recognized
a statutory privilege in civil matters: see s. 42 of the Medical Act,
R.S.Q. 1977, c. M-9.  Neither at common law nor by statute have communications
between counsellors and sexual assault complainants been recognized as
privileged in Canada.

 

39                    The question of privilege has
recently been visited by our Court in Gruenke, supra.  In that
case, the Court had to decide whether communications from an accused to her
pastor and to a lay counsellor were privileged in criminal proceedings at
common law and under the freedom of religion guarantee in s. 2  of the Charter . 
The majority discussed the two categories of privilege at common law: first, a
""class"" privilege, and second, a ""case-by-case"" privilege. 
A class privilege entails a prima facie presumption that such
communications are inadmissible or not subject to disclosure in criminal or
civil proceedings and the onus lies on the party seeking disclosure of the
information to show that an overriding interest commands disclosure.  In order
for the privilege to attach, compelling policy reasons must exist, similar to
those underlying the privilege for solicitor-client communications, and the
relationship must be inextricably linked with the justice system.

 

40                    In a case-by-case privilege,
the communications are not privileged unless the party opposing disclosure can
show they should be privileged according to the fourfold utilitarian test
elaborated by Wigmore (Evidence in Trials at Common Law (McNaughton rev.
1961), vol. 8, at § 2285).  These criteria are:

 

            (1)        The
communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be
disclosed.

 

            (2)        This
element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and
satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties.

 

            (3)        The
relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be
sedulously fostered.

 

            (4)        The
injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the
communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the
correct disposal of litigation.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

See Gruenke, at p. 286, per
Lamer C.J. for the majority; also Solicitor General of Canada v. Royal
Commission of Inquiry (Health Records in Ontario), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 494, at
p. 512, per Laskin C.J., dissenting; and Slavutych v. Baker,
[1976] 1 S.C.R. 254, at p. 260.

 

41                    The issue of whether private
records held by third parties are privileged at common law has never been
decided by this Court.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal did, however, consider
it in R. v. Ryan (1991), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 226.  The question was whether
social agency records of two sexual assault complainants were privileged in a
criminal trial for sexual assault and narcotic trafficking.  The trial judge
had recognized that the records were privileged and had ordered a stay of
proceedings for denial of the accused's right to make full answer and defence. 
The Court of Appeal held that the competing interests at stake weighed in
favour of disclosure and overruled the stay.  Similarly, in R. v. R.S.
(1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 115, the Ontario Court of Appeal had to decide whether
records relating to family group therapy sessions were privileged in the
criminal trial of a man accused of having sexually assaulted his two
step-daughters.  The Court of Appeal opined that, in the context of child
abuse, the search for the truth overcomes the interests in family therapy and,
therefore, the records could be produced at trial.  See also the decisions of
the British Columbia Supreme Court in R. v. Kliman, [1994] B.C.W.L.D.
No. 587, and of the Ontario Court, General Division, in R. v. Coon
(1991), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 146.

 

42                    In the context of civil
litigation, some courts and masters have examined claims of privilege.  In M.(A.)
v. Ryan, [1993] 7 W.W.R. 480, the British Columbia Supreme Court considered
whether psychiatric records had to be produced in a civil suit for sexual
abuse.  The court held that, while confidentiality was essential to the
psychiatrist-patient relationship, the interest in the proper administration of
justice prevailed over the need to maintain confidentiality.  In M.(E.) v.
Martinson (1993), 81 B.C.L.R. (2d) 184 (Master), the defendant sought
production of the plaintiff's counselling records of treatment for sexual
abuse, alcoholism and drug addiction, in an attempt to show that the alleged
pain and suffering did not result from the automobile accident which was the
object of the suit.  It was held that, in the circumstances, the interest in
maintaining the confidentiality of the records outweighed the benefit there may
have been to the administration of justice by their disclosure.

 

43                    The Law Reform Commission of
Canada has recommended the recognition of a general privilege for professionals
in criminal proceedings in its Report on Evidence (1975), although not
without a caveat.  Section 41 of the proposed Evidence Code provides:

 

            41.       A person who has consulted a
person exercising a profession for the purpose of obtaining professional
services, or who has been rendered such services by a professional person, has
a privilege against disclosure of any confidential communication reasonably
made in the course of the relationship if, in the circumstances, the public
interest in the privacy of the relationship outweighs the public interest in
the administration of justice.  [Emphasis added.]

 

44                    The American position with
regard to privilege at common law is somewhat similar to the Canadian
approach.  The rationales underlying the recognition of privileged
communications are also analogous (see McCormick on Evidence, supra,
at § 72).  However, in the United States, a number of communications, including
those between counsellors and sexual assault complainants, are considered
privileged as a result of the enactment of statutory privilege, both by the
Federal Government and by the states, for communications that are not
privileged at common law.  See Scott N. Stone and Robert K. Taylor, in Testimonial
Privileges (2nd ed. 1993), for a more detailed compilation of the statutes
granting such privilege in the United States as well as the degree and the
extent of confidentiality it affords to such communications.

 

45                    Without going into a detailed
analysis, it is fair to say that many states in the United States have enacted
some statute limiting disclosure and testimony by doctors, psychiatrists,
psychologists, social workers, and other psychotherapists.  An increasing
number of states are according privileged status to communications between
counsellors and sexual assault complainants; they include Alaska, California,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wyoming.  Most of these privileges provide an absolute
protection of private records relating to sexual assault complainants in
criminal trials.

 

46                    There is, however, a
constitutional element to the law of privilege in the United States.  The right
to a fair trial (or ""due process""), as guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment, as well as the rights guaranteed by the confrontation clause and the
compulsory process clause of the Sixth Amendment, impose limits on statutory
privilege (see Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39 (1987); United
States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308
(1974); and Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967)).  The Supreme Court
of the United States has determined the constitutionality of privilege in general
as regards the disclosure and the admissibility of evidence through a balancing
process, weighing the rights of the accused, as guaranteed by the American
Constitution, against the public interests served by privilege.  That court has
yet to decide the question of constitutionality of absolute privilege attaching
to private records of sexual assault complainants, but there are a number of
commentators who have dealt with this issue:  see Maureen B. Hogan, ""The
Constitutionality of an Absolute Privilege for Rape Crisis Counseling: A
Criminal Defendant's Sixth Amendment Rights Versus a Rape Victim's Right to
Confidential Therapeutic Counseling"" (1989), 30 Boston College L. Rev.
411, at pp. 470-74; Welsh S. White, ""Evidentiary Privileges and the
Defendant's Constitutional Right to Introduce Evidence"" (1989), 80 J.
Crim. L. & Criminology 377, at pp. 423-25; and Robert Weisberg, supra,
at pp. 968-73.

 

47                    On the other hand, several
state courts have addressed the conflict between sexual assault defendants'
constitutional rights and absolute confidentiality privilege for sexual assault
counselling communications.  Most have ruled that such absolute privilege is
unconstitutional because it infringes upon defendants' constitutional rights:
see In re Robert H., 509 A.2d 475 (Conn. 1986); Commonwealth v. Two
Juveniles, 491 N.E.2d 234 (Mass. 1986); Commonwealth v. Samuels, 511
A.2d 221 (Penn. 1986); Advisory Opinion to the House of Representatives,
469 A.2d 1161 (R.I. 1983).  Both the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in Commonwealth
v. Wilson, 602 A.2d 1290 (1992), and the Supreme Court of Illinois, in People
v. Foggy, 521 N.E.2d 86 (1988), have found the same kind of absolute
privilege constitutional.

 

48                    Most Commonwealth countries,
including England, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, use a
different qualification of privilege. These countries distinguish between
private privilege and public interest immunity.  See Sir Rupert Cross, Cross
on Evidence (7th ed. 1990), at pp. 416 et seq. and 456 et seq.;
David Field, The Law of Evidence in Scotland (1988), at pp. 248 et
seq.; Caroline Fennell, The Law of Evidence in Ireland (1992), at
pp. 165 et seq. and 193 et seq.; Sir Rupert Cross, Evidence,
(3rd ed. 1979), at pp. 254 et seq. and 284 et seq.; and Andrew
Ligertwood, Australian Evidence (2nd ed. 1993), at pp. 207 et seq.
and 280 et seq.

 

49                    Private privilege at common
law is limited to legal professional relationships.  As regards other
relationships, such as doctor-patient, pastor-penitent, journalist-informants
and spousal relationships, no privilege is recognized in the absence of
statutory provisions.  England, for example, has no statutory provision
providing for a general privilege for doctor-patient communications, with only
limited exceptions in civil proceedings; there is nothing specifically relating
to counsellor-sexual assault complainant communications either.  The situation
is the same in both Scotland and Ireland.  New Zealand and the states of
Victoria and Tasmania and the Northern Territory in Australia have enacted
civil proceeding privilege regarding communications between physicians and
their patients.  The legislation, however, is silent on sexual assault
counselling communications and the case law has not extended the existing
privileges to cover such communications.

 

50                    In these Commonwealth
countries, public interest immunity (formally referred to as Crown privilege)
constitutes the residual basis to prevent relevant evidence from being
disclosed or being found admissible when considerations of public policy are
found to be more important than the full disclosure of facts.  See D. v.
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, [1978] A.C. 171
(H.L.); Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines Ltd. v. Customs and Excise
Commissioners (No. 2), [1974] A.C. 405 (H.L.), and Rogers v. Home
Secretary, [1973] A.C. 388 (H.L.).  The immunity is founded in the common
law; it is not a creature of statute.  It gives protection to state interests,
reports of proceedings in Parliament, police matters and other confidential
subjects, including educational records, social worker logs and medical
documents: see Campbell v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, [1982]
1 Q.B. 1065 (C.A.); and Gaskin v. Liverpool City Council, [1980] 1
W.L.R. 1549 (C.A.).

 

51                    In the criminal law context,
public interest immunity cannot prevent the disclosure or bar the admissibility
of documents that can enable the accused to resist an allegation of crime or to
establish innocence: see Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., [1942] A.C.
624 (H.L.).  In that respect, English courts have held that the public interest
in ensuring a fair trial for a defendant outweighs the interest in protecting
such confidential records if their disclosure is necessary for the defendant's
full answer and defence.  See, in the context of governmental documents, R.
v. Governor of Brixton Prison, Ex parte Osman, [1991] 1 W.L.R. 281 (Q.B.);
concerning the identity of police informants, R. v. Agar, [1990] 2 All
E.R. 442 (C.A.); and in the context of social worker logs, Re M (A Minor)
(Disclosure of Material), [1990] 2 F.L.R. 36 (C.A.).  See also Rachel
Langdale and Simeon Maskrey, ""Public Interest Immunity: Disclosure of
Social Work Records"" (1994), 24 Fam. L. 513.

 

52                    Courts of Commonwealth
countries have not addressed the issue of whether private records of sexual
assault complainants must be disclosed in criminal proceedings.  However, given
how this issue has been decided in other contexts, it is doubtful that public
interest immunity would bar disclosure of such records when the accused's guilt
or innocence is at stake.  In the general context of medical records, the Lord
Chancellor in England made the following statement (reported at (1956) 197 H.L.
Official Report (5th series), col. 745):

 

We
also propose that if medical documents, or indeed other documents, are relevant
to the defence in criminal proceedings, Crown privilege [public interest
immunity] should not be claimed.

 

This statement was quoted with
approval by Lord Reid in Conway v. Rimmer, [1968] A.C. 910 (H.L.), at p.
942.  Therefore, in England at least, in criminal proceedings, it appears that
the balance between the right to full answer and defence and the public
policies supporting the recognition of a privilege for sexual assault
counselling communications is likely to be struck in favour of the former.

 

53                    With this background in mind,
I now turn to the question raised by the appellants and the interveners: 
Whether, as a matter of law, private records of complainants in sexual assault
criminal proceedings should, as a class, be considered privileged
communications.  In my view, they should not for the reasons that follow.

 

C.Privilege
for Private Records of Sexual Assault Complainants

 

54                    Under this heading, the
appellants and the interveners who favour recognizing a class privilege at
common law for communications between counsellors and sexual assault
complainants raise five arguments.  They can be summarized as follows: (1)
sexual assault counselling relationships are based upon and depend on
confidentiality; (2) without confidentiality, sexual assault victims will be
deterred from seeking counselling; (3) the deterrent effect of disclosure which
leads to under-reporting of sexual assault cases, undermines the effectiveness
of the criminal justice system; (4) records of statements made in the course of
sexual assault counselling are both hearsay and inherently unreliable; and (5)
the common law principles governing privilege need to be in step with Charter
values.  The appellants and the interveners elaborate on each of those
arguments and their points are well taken.

 

55                    Firstly, victims of sexual
assaults are subject to the lingering and debilitating effects of sexual
assault trauma syndrome.  The sexual assault counsellors are specifically
trained to help victims recover from sexual assault trauma syndrome.  Sexual
assault victims often take the first step to recovery by talking about the
sexual assault experience in a non-judgmental and confidential atmosphere: see
Kim E. Williamson, ""Confidentiality of Sexual Assault Victim-Counselor
Communication: A Proposed Model Statute"" (1984), 26 Ariz. L. Rev.
461, at pp. 466-67; and Carrie J. Scarmeas, ""Rape Victim-Rape Crisis
Counselor Communications: A New Testimonial Privilege"" (1982), 86 Dick.
L. Rev. 539, at pp. 543-44.

 

56                    Confidentiality in sexual
assault counselling is essential in creating the sense of security necessary to
encourage the free flow of discussion which is crucial to the victim's
recovery.  Unless the victim is guaranteed confidentiality she will be inhibited
in her discussions and unable to receive the full benefits of counselling: see
Michael Laurence, in ""Rape Victim-Crisis Counselor Communications: An
Argument for an Absolute Privilege"" (1984), 17 U.C. Davis L. Rev.
1213, at pp. 1223-24.

 

57                    Secondly, without the
assurance of confidentiality, sexual assault victims will be more likely to be
deterred from seeking counselling or from divulging all the information to
their counsellors.  This deterrent effect of disclosure is not only detrimental
to the victims but also to society as a whole.  In R. v. Osolin, [1993]
4 S.C.R. 595, I made the following observation regarding the disclosure of
medical records (at p. 622):

 

            First,
common sense dictates that if people are aware that medical records can and may
very well be obtained to attack the credibility of a witness, they may be
reluctant to seek needed and valuable treatment if there is any prospect that
they may be required to testify at trial, particularly if there is any connection
between the events at trial and the subjects of discussion in the treatment
process.

 

58                    Thirdly, this deterrent
effect has further repercussions on the functioning of the criminal legal
process.  Because sexual assault counselling and therapy may lead victims to
report the crime to the authorities, anything that deters victims from seeking
treatment will accentuate the under-reporting of offences.  This Court has
recognized that chronic under-reporting of sexual assault cases undermines the
effectiveness of the criminal justice system.  See, in the context of
publication bans, Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General),
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at pp. 131-32; and, in the context of sexual assaults, Seaboyer,
supra, at pp. 649-50, per L'Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting but not
on this point, and R. v. L. (D.O.), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, at pp. 441-42, per
L'Heureux-Dubé J. for the Court in the result.

 

59                    According to Statistics
Canada, only six percent of the sexual assaults surveyed in 1993 were reported
to the police.  Fear of the attitudes likely to be shown by the police and the
courts toward complainants continues to deter significant numbers of women from
reporting.  See J. Roberts, ""Criminal Justice Processing of Sexual Assault
Cases"" (1994), 14:7 Juristat 1; see also Canadian Panel on Violence
Against Women, Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence - Achieving Equality
(1993), at pp. 28-29.

 

60                    The legal system has a direct
and vital interest in promoting the reporting of sexual assaults.  It is
important to recognize the impact that procedural and substantive rules have
upon the resolve of sexual assault victims to obtain treatment and upon the
reporting of crimes of this nature.  Therefore, the societal importance of the
relationships between counsellors and sexual assault complainants necessarily
goes beyond the benefit to the victims; it is also vitally linked to the
effectiveness of the criminal justice system to deal with sexual assault
crimes.

 

61                    As a fourth point, the
appellants and the interveners note that records of statements made in the
course of medical or therapeutic treatments are both hearsay and inherently
unreliable (see Osolin, supra, at pp. 622-23).  The information
given by sexual assault victims expressed in the course of counselling sessions
constitutes second-hand communications.  The rule against hearsay evidence
requires that such communications be considered inadmissible at trial because
of its lack of trustworthiness.  The same reasoning supports the conclusion
that private records of sexual assault complainants ought not to be produced or
serve as a basis for the defence.

 

62                    These records are inherently
unreliable because they were gathered in a medical or therapeutic treatment
context: see Marilyn T. MacCrimmon and Christine Boyle, ""Equality,
Fairness and Relevance: Disclosure of Therapists' Records in Sexual Assault
Trials"", in Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice, Filtering
and Analyzing Evidence in an Age of Diversity (1995), 81, at pp. 103-5. 
The questions asked by sexual assault counsellors encompass more than the
particular events in issue at trial; they include a wide range of elements such
as personal history, thoughts, emotions and other irrelevant information.  In
fact, sexual assault counsellors' records are prepared for the sole purpose of
assisting counselling, not for the purpose of establishing accurate historical
records for criminal proceedings.  Further, private records do not necessarily
represent the precise words spoken by the sexual assault complainants.  Even if
they did, the records would not qualify as statements under s. 10(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , unless the complainants reviewed and ratified the content of
the records.  As well, sexual assault counselling records are not necessarily
prepared contemporaneously with the counselling session, or even immediately
afterwards.  As a result, the reliability or even the relevance of private
records relating to sexual assault complainants are highly questionable.

 

63                    Finally, the common law
principles governing privilege must be consistent with the constitutional
values enshrined in the Charter: see Marilyn T. MacCrimmon,
""Developments in the Law of Evidence: The 1991-92 Term: Truth, Fairness
and Equality"" (1993), 4 Sup. Ct. L. Rev. (2d) 225, at pp. 258-59. 
As regards private records of sexual assault complainants, these values include
the complainant's privacy and equality interests.  In Gruenke, supra,
Lamer C.J.'s analysis of a case-by-case privilege in favour of communications
made in confidence to a pastor was informed by the right to freedom of religion
in s. 2(a) and by the multicultural interpretation clause in s. 27 of
the Charter.  He wrote at pp. 290-91:

 

The
Wigmore criteria will be informed both by the Charter guarantee of
freedom of religion and by the general interpretative statement in s. 27 of the
Charter. . . .

 

                                                                             ...

 

 

In
applying the Wigmore criteria to particular cases, both s. 2 (a) and s.
27 must be kept in mind.  This means that the case-by-case analysis must begin
with a ""non-denominational"" approach.  The fact that the
communications were not made to an ordained priest or minister or that they did
not constitute a formal confession will not bar the possibility of the
communications' being excluded.  All of the relevant circumstances must be
considered and the Wigmore criteria applied in a manner which is sensitive to
the fact of Canada's multicultural heritage.

 

See also Re Church of Scientology
and The Queen (No. 6) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at p. 540, where the
Ontario Court of Appeal stated that the common law interpretation of privilege
might have to be reconsidered in relation to the constitutional rights
affected.

 

64                    This is consistent with the
approach adopted by this Court in RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986]
2 S.C.R. 573, where McIntyre J. said at p. 603: ""the judiciary ought to
apply and develop the principles of the common law in a manner consistent with
the fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution"".  More recently, in Dagenais,
supra, the Court had to consider the common law rule governing the
issuance of publication bans in the context of conflicting constitutional
rights, namely freedom of expression and the presumption of innocence.  Lamer
C.J., speaking for the majority of the Court, after relying on this dicta
of McIntyre J., added (at p. 878):

 

I
am, therefore, of the view that it is necessary to reformulate the common law
rule governing the issuance of publication bans in a manner that reflects the
principles of the Charter.  Given that publication bans, by their very
definition, curtail the freedom of expression of third parties, I believe that
the common law rule must be adapted so as to require a consideration both of
the objectives of a publication ban, and the proportionality of the ban to its
effect on protected Charter rights.

 

See also Hill v. Church of
Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 95-97, per
Cory J. for the Court in the result, and at para. 206, per
L'Heureux-Dubé J., concurring; R. v. Park, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para.
51, per L'Heureux-Dubé J. for the Court in the result; and Salituro,
supra, at p. 675.

 

65                    As can be seen from the above
discussion, there are strong arguments of public policy which militate in
favour of protecting the confidentiality of counsellor-sexual assault
complainant communications in criminal trials.  They do not, however,
necessarily support the recognition of a class privilege in favour of private
records.  There are many avenues open to prevent production of such records if
the need arises.  Hearsay and irrelevance constitute one of these avenues; as
discussed in R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, released concurrently,
the balancing of competing constitutional rights is another avenue, to which I
will return later.  The recognition of a class privilege for private records is
not, in my view, the proper approach and I agree with the reasoning advanced by
the Attorney General of Manitoba in this respect.  Generally, class privilege
presents many impediments to the proper administration of justice and, for that
reason, has not been favoured in Canada and elsewhere in criminal trials.  A
class privilege is a complete bar to the information contained in such records,
whether or not relevant, and the onus to override it is a heavy one indeed.  The
particular concerns raised by the recognition of a class privilege in favour of
private records in criminal law relate to: (1) the truth-finding process of our
adversarial trial procedure; (2) the possible relevance of some private
records; (3) the accused's right to make full answer and defence; (4) the
categories of actors included in a class privilege; and (5) the experience of
other countries.

 

66                    The principal aim of our
adversarial trial process is the search for the truth.  In order for justice to
be rendered, the judicial system must have the right to all relevant
information:  see Pierre Tessier, ""La vérité et la justice"" (1988),
19 R.G.D. 29, at p. 32.  This is the foundation of the requirement that
everyone must testify in court if requested by subpoena and, in civil cases, of
the rules relating to the disclosure of documents in the pre-trial discovery
process.  Accordingly, relevant information is presumptively admissible and
subject to disclosure, while the recognition of privilege is confined to
limited communications.  In that respect, Professor Mewett, in Witnesses
(1991), makes the following observations at p. 15-2:

 

[T]he
objective of all testimony is the eliciting of information from which
conclusions may be drawn.  It is therefore fundamental to the litigation
process that the court or other tribunal have available to it all relevant
evidence, unless some other social value is perceived to exist that takes
priority over the ascertainment of the truth.  All claims of privilege
hinder the search for the truth since they result in the concealment of what
may be helpful and, indeed, crucial information.  It is not surprising,
therefore, that claims to privilege should be carefully scrutinised by the
courts and only rarely upheld. [Emphasis added]

 

See also S. A. Tacon, ""A Question
of Privilege: Valid Protection or Obstruction of Justice?"" (1979), 17 Osgoode
Hall L.J. 332; and Beverley McLachlin (now of this Court),
""Confidential Communications and the Law of Privilege"" (1977), 11 U.B.C.
L. Rev. 266.

 

67                    Even if most private records
relating to sexual assault complainants are generally irrelevant, some of them
can contain information which may be ""likely to be relevant either to an
issue in the trial or to the competence to testify of the subject of the
records"" (see O'Connor, supra, at para. 134).  The
recognition of a class privilege for communications that can contain highly
relevant information in criminal proceedings must be limited to situations
where the other social interests are indubitably ""compelling"" (see Gruenke,
supra, at p. 288).  The recognition of a class privilege in favour of
private records relating to sexual assault complainants would be a complete bar
to the production and disclosure of the information contained therein,
irrespective of its relevance.  Because there can be instances where private
records will be likely relevant, either to an issue in the proceedings or to
the competence of the witness to testify, class privilege does not constitute
the proper legal doctrine to govern the issue of production of private records
held by third parties.

 

68                    As a third point related to
the possible relevancy of private records of sexual assault complainants, the
accused's right to make full answer and defence militates against the
recognition of class privilege in criminal proceedings.  Privilege constitutes
a limit upon the truth-finding principle of our justice system and,
consequently, may impair the accused's full enjoyment of his or her right to
respond to criminal accusations.

 

69                    When the enforcement of a
privilege means that the accused will be limited as to his or her right to make
full answer and defence to criminal accusations, this Court has strongly tended
to favour disclosure.  The informer privilege, for instance, will be set aside
if the confidential material can demonstrate the innocence of an accused
person: see R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at pp. 995-96, per
Cory J. for the majority; and Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60,
at p. 93.  Even the solicitor-client privilege, which has been elevated to a
""fundamental civil and legal right"" (see Geffen v. Goodman Estate,
[1991] 2 S.C.R. 353, at p. 383, per Wilson J.; and Solosky v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, at p. 839), will be overridden to allow the
accused to make full answer and defence to criminal charges: see Seaboyer,
supra, at p. 607, per McLachlin J. for the majority; and R. v.
Dunbar and Logan (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 43-45

 

70                    At common law, the main
condition for a class privilege to be recognized in favour of certain
communications is that the category of actors be limited to specific people. 
The solicitor-client class privilege, for example, involves definite actors:
one is a qualified lawyer and the other is the client.  In that regard, John Sopinka
(of this Court), Sidney N. Lederman and Alan W. Bryant, in The Law of
Evidence in Canada (1992), remark at p. 649:

 

            The
protection [of the privilege], however, does not extend to communications with
persons who are not duly qualified legal advisers even though the advice they
might give is legal in nature.

 

71                    By contrast, the category of
actors involved in sexual assault counselling relationships is not
restricted to a defined group of qualified professionals and their clients. 
Whereas counselling in such cases may be provided by medical professionals,
such as physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, sexual assault
complainants may also resort to community resources, sexual assault crisis
centres, pastors, parents, friends, etc.  To extend a class privilege to all
these interveners might mean that information gathered in group therapy or
communications relating to mental health exchanged on pay-per-call telephone
service lines could attract such privilege.  At common law, as it now exists,
such a wide category of actors militates against the recognition of a class
privilege since it would considerably limit the defense and close avenues of
information which the search for the truth and justice may warrant in some
circumstances.

 

72                    In the context of privileged
communications for psychotherapist-patient relationships, which are very
similar to sexual assault counselling relationships, Catharina J. H. Dubbelday,
in ""The Psychotherapist-Client Testimonial Privilege: Defining the
Professional Involved"" (1985), 34 Emory L.J. 777, makes these
observations at p. 812:

 

            In
the case of doctors, lawyers, and spouses, determining the individual to whom
communications are privileged is usually not difficult because of state
regulation of these professions and relationships.  In the case of clergymen,
courts look to the tenets of the clergyman's faith for assistance when
definitional problems arise.  In the context of the psychotherapist-client
privilege, however, determining who is a ""psychotherapist"" is a
problem that is not easily resolved.  On the one hand, the strong policy
considerations supporting a psychotherapist-client privilege do not seem to
apply only to clients of licensed individuals.  On the other hand, the
court's need for truth will not permit a privilege that is so broad that almost
every communication to any individual is covered.  [Emphasis added.]

 

See also Kerry L. Morse, ""A
Uniform Testimonial Privilege for Mental Health Professionals"" (1990), 51 Ohio
St. L.J. 741, at p. 745.

 

73                    Lastly, a review of the
position of other common law countries demonstrates that, in criminal
proceedings, a class (or absolute) privilege for counsellor-sexual assault
complainant communications is not generally supported.  In the United States,
no privilege exists at common law for sexual assault counselling communications
and although many states have enacted a statutory class privilege for such
communications, many of these absolute privileges have been struck down as
unconstitutional by state courts on the basis that they infringe upon
defendants' rights as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments: see In
re Robert H., supra; Commonwealth v. Two Juveniles, supra;
Commonwealth v. Samuels, supra; and Advisory Opinion to the
House of Representatives, supra.  In Commonwealth countries, such as
England, Scotland, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, no private privilege
exists, at common law or under statutory law, for communications between
counsellors and sexual assault complainants.  Where limited doctor-patient
privileges exist, they are restricted to civil proceedings and have not been
extended to cover sexual assault counselling communications.  Public interest
immunity in Commonwealth countries is different from class privilege as it
exists in Canada.  It is decided on an ad hoc basis and is more
analogous to case-by-case privilege.

 

74                    In the end, balancing those
arguments, I am of the view that recognizing a class privilege in criminal
trials for private records relating to sexual assault complainants is not the
best way to serve the interests of justice.  As argued by the appellants and
the interveners, there are strong public policy considerations which may favour
non-production of private records relating to sexual assault complainants in
criminal trials, but on balance, I conclude that class privilege is not the
avenue which should govern the extent of production of private records held by
third parties in criminal trials.

 

75                    This does not mean, however,
that the granting of a case-by-case privilege may not be appropriate in some
circumstances, where the Wigmore criteria are met.  The determination of
whether such a privilege ought to attach will, of course, depend on the facts
of each case as they relate to the four Wigmore criteria.  Given the nature of
the relationship between counsellors and sexual assault complainants, the first
three criteria will easily be met in most cases.  As it appears from the
foregoing discussion, such relationships are founded on trust and confidence,
confidentiality is essential to their maintenance and the public fosters and
supports these counselling relationships.  The fourth criterion involves the
balancing of the relative values which favour finding these records privileged
with those which favour production, if, of course, the records are found to be
likely relevant either to an issue in the proceedings or to the competence of
the witness to testify (see O'Connor, supra).  This is where the
arguments for and against production, which I have discussed earlier, will be
examined.  

 

76                    It must be remembered that
the determination as to whether privilege should be granted in a particular
case is based purely on public policy considerations; it does not involve the
balancing of the complainant's Charter rights to privacy and equality
with those of the accused to make full answer and defense.  Even though the
confidentiality of private records relating to sexual assault complainants does
engage privacy and equality interests, the assertion of constitutional rights
of privacy and equality is distinct from the issue of privilege. 

77                    In brief, while there is
surely ground to recognize a case-by-case privilege for private records of
sexual assault complainants in some instances, I do not think that such
exceptions to the general evidentiary rule of admissibility and disclosure
should be encouraged.  This ad hoc approach to privilege will not serve
the main policy consideration behind the granting of privilege for sexual
assault counselling communications, i.e., that the complainants should be
assured at the outset that information shared with counsellors will be kept
confidential.  Consequently, it will not cure the most important ills
associated with production of private records, notably the deterrent effect
that such production has on reporting and counselling.   

 

78                    A better approach to this
difficult problem, in my view, lies in the balancing of, on the one hand, the Charter
rights to privacy and equality of the sexual assault complainant with, on the
other hand, the accused's Charter rights to a fair trial and to full
answer and defence.  While this approach may suffer from some of the shortcomings
discussed previously as regards the granting of class and case-by-case
privileges, it ensures that proper consideration is equally given to competing
constitutional rights (Dagenais, supra, at p. 877).  This is the
approach advocated in O'Connor, supra, which should be read as
herein recited at length and which I will briefly summarize.

 

VI.Balancing
Charter Values

 

79                    When deciding whether to
order production of private records held by third parties, the court must exercise
its discretion in a manner that is respectful of Charter values:  Dagenais,
supra, at p. 875.  The constitutional values involved here are: (1) the
right to full answer and defence; (2) the right to privacy; and (3) the right
to equality without discrimination.  These rights are well recognized and are
discussed at length in O'Connor, supra.  I will only briefly
refer to them here.

 

80                    The right to full answer and
defence, as guaranteed in s. 7  of the Charter , does not need much
elaboration.  The ability for an accused to make full answer and defence
constitutes a principle of fundamental justice (see Stinchcombe, supra;
and R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451).  However, the extent of all
principles of fundamental justice varies according to the context in which they
are invoked (see R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309).

 

81                    This Court has on many
occasions recognized privacy as an interest protected by the Charter
(see R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417; R. v. Beare, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 387; R. v. Pohoretsky, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945; Hunter v. Southam
Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145) and by the common law (see McInerney v.
MacDonald, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 138; Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto,
supra).  The civil law in Quebec also provides legal protection to
privacy interests (see arts. 35 and 36 of the Civil Code of Québec, S.Q.
1991, c. 64; and art. 5 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms). 
It is interesting to note, in passing, that the Supreme Court of the United
States has also conferred constitutional status upon certain aspects of
privacy: see Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); and Griswold v.
Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965).

 

82                    In O'Connor, supra,
I concluded that private records of sexual assault complainants attract a
reasonable expectation of privacy (at para. 118):

 

            In
R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, albeit in the context of a discussion
of s. 8  of the Charter , a majority of this Court identified one context
in which the right to privacy would generally arise in respect of documents and
records (at p. 293):

 

In
fostering the underlying values of dignity, integrity and autonomy, it is
fitting that s. 8  of the Charter  should seek to protect a biographical
core of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society
would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state.  This
would include information which tends to reveal intimate details of the
lifestyle and personal choices of the individual. 

 

Although
I prefer not to decide today whether this definition is exhaustive of the right
to privacy in respect of all manners of documents and records, I am satisfied
that the nature of the private records which are the subject matter of this
appeal properly brings them within that rubric.  Such items may consequently be
viewed as disclosing a reasonable expectation of privacy which is worthy of
protection under s. 7  of the Charter .  [Emphasis added in O'Connor.]

 

83                    Finally, the right to
equality without discrimination, as guaranteed in s. 15  of the Charter ,
is relevant to the analysis because private records of sexual assault
complainants relate to a crime which overwhelmingly affects women, children and
the disabled.  I had the opportunity in O'Connor, to consider the right
to equality without discrimination and the following comment applies mutatis
mutandis to the instant case (at para. 124):

 

 

            Routine
insistence on the exposure of complainants' personal backgrounds has the
potential to reflect a built-in bias in the criminal justice system against
those most vulnerable to repeat victimization.  Such requests, in essence, rest
on the assumption that the personal and psychological backgrounds and profiles
of complainants of sexual assault are relevant as to whether or not the
complainant consented to the sexual contact, or whether the accused honestly
believed that she consented. 

 

84                    After a more detailed
analysis of each of these rights and their constitutional basis in the Charter,
I concluded in O'Connor (at para. 132):

 

            The
use of state power to compel production of private records will be justified in
a free and democratic society when the following criteria are applied.  First,
production should only be granted when it is shown that the accused cannot
obtain the information sought by any other reasonably available and effective
alternative means.  Second, production which infringes upon a right to privacy
must be as limited as reasonably possible to fulfil the right to make full
answer and defence.  Third, arguments urging production must rest upon
permissible chains of reasoning, rather than upon discriminatory assumptions
and stereotypes.  Finally, there must be a proportionality between the salutary
effects of production on the accused's right to make full answer and defence as
compared with the deleterious effects on the party whose private records are
being produced.

 

85                    In summary, in addition to
the public policy considerations which the appellants and interveners have
underlined, and which I have recounted earlier, militating against the
production of private records held by third parties, a balancing of the Charter
rights of complainants and accuseds also militates against such production.  As
Lamer C.J. said in Dagenais, supra, at p. 877, in the context of
a publication ban, the common law should not accord pre-eminence to the right
to a fair trial, over other constitutionally entrenched rights:

 

 

            The
pre-Charter common law rule governing publication bans emphasized the
right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by
the ban.  In my view, the balance this rule strikes is inconsistent with the
principles of the Charter, and in particular, the equal status given by
the Charter to ss. 2(b) and 11(d).  It would be
inappropriate for the courts to continue to apply a common law rule that
automatically favoured the rights protected by s. 11(d) over those
protected by s. 2(b).  A hierarchical approach to rights, which places
some over others, must be avoided, both when interpreting the Charter
and when developing the common law.  When the protected rights of two
individuals come into conflict, as can occur in the case of publication bans, Charter
principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance
of both sets of rights.

 

Similarly, as regards the production
of private records held by third parties, a balance must be struck that places
the Charter rights of complainants on an equal footing with those of
accused persons.  

 

VII.      Procedure for Obtaining
Production

 

86                    The procedure for obtaining
production of private records held by a third party is outlined in O'Connor,
supra.  Essentially, the first step for an accused who seeks production
of such records is to obtain and serve on the third party a subpoena duces
tecum.  The form of the subpoena and the procedure for its issuance are
described in Part XXII of the Code.  When the subpoena is served, the
Crown and the subject of the records referred to in the subpoena, as well as
any other person with an interest in the confidentiality of the records, should
be notified that the accused will ask the trial judge to order the production
of the records.

 

87                    At the trial, when the
accused requests an order for production of the records, the judge should
follow a two‑stage approach.  First, the accused must demonstrate that
the information contained in the records is likely relevant either to an
issue in the proceedings or to the competence to testify of the person who is
the subject of the records.  At this stage, the subject's privacy interest does
not enter into consideration.  At the same time, however, the information must
be sought because of its relevance, rather than for illegitimate purposes.  

 

88                    It may be useful at this
stage for the third party to prepare a list of the records in its possession (R.
v. Barbosa (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 131 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 136). 
In an appropriate case, the trial judge may require such a list to be provided
to the accused, the Crown and the court.  

 

89                    However, I wish to emphasize
that, as with any other motion, an application for an order for production of
private records held by a third party must be accompanied by affidavit evidence
which establishes to the judge's satisfaction that the information sought is
likely to be relevant.  The accused's demonstration that information is likely
to be relevant must be based on evidence, not on speculative assertions or on
discriminatory or stereotypical reasoning.  

 

90                    If the court is satisfied
that the information contained in the records is likely to be relevant, then
the analysis proceeds to the balancing stage, which has two parts.  The accused
must first show that the salutary effects of ordering the documents produced to
the court for inspection outweigh the deleterious effects of such production. 
If the judge decides that production to the court is warranted, he or she
should so order.  Then, after examining the records, the judge must balance and
reconcile the conflicting constitutional rights discussed above to determine whether
and to what extent production to the defence should be ordered.  Only those
parts of records that have a significant probative value to the issues at trial
or the competence of the witness which is not substantially outweighed by
prejudice to the administration of justice or to the witness' privacy and
equality rights should be produced.

 

91                    Of course, even if production
is ordered, it must still be determined whether the produced records are
admissible.  Questions of voluntariness and hearsay, for example, may arise.  

 

92                    It is apparent from the
procedure I have described that the court's inquiry into the relevance of the
information and its balancing of the competing interests for and against
production should be made at the time of the trial.  Although the respondent
has argued forcefully in favour of a pre‑trial determination of these
issues, I have not been persuaded by his arguments.

 

93                    Although a pre‑trial
order for the production of documents held by a third party may be obtained in
civil matters, such an order is alien to criminal proceedings.  In criminal
matters, witnesses are called at trial, whether by way of subpoena duces
tecum or otherwise.  Only at that time can a witness be ordered to give
evidence.  In this respect, Professor Lee Stuesser, in ""Reconciling
Disclosure and Privilege"" (1994), 30 C.R. (4th) 67, remarks at p. 75:

 

 

            Under
the rules of civil procedure a court may order production of documents from non‑parties,
but nowhere in the Criminal Code  do you find comparable authority for
pre‑trial disclosure by witnesses in a criminal case.  Nor does Stinchcombe
provide any such authority.

 

94                    Before the trial, a
prospective witness is not obliged to cooperate with either the Crown or the
defence, and a court should not compel a witness to provide the defence with a
preview of his or her evidence.  The respondent has advanced no persuasive
argument why prospective defence witnesses in sexual assault cases should be
treated differently.

 

95                    The respondent points out
that, should the witness be uncooperative, the defence will have little means
to verify, before the trial begins, whether the private records in question are
relevant to its case.  However, the situation would be no different in any
other trial in which a witness has refused to cooperate with the defence. 
Moreover, regardless of the cooperation of the witness before the trial, the
evidence in any trial is only ascertained once the witness is actually in the
witness box.

 

96                    Furthermore, one must not
lose sight of the fact that, in most cases, private records of the kind here in
question will be irrelevant and inadmissible hearsay evidence.  As I have
discussed above, notes of statements made by complainants in a therapeutic
context are not necessarily contemporaneous with the counselling session, have
not been ratified by the complainant, and are not intended to be an accurate
record of what the complainant said.  Moreover, they touch on a multitude of
topics irrelevant to the issues in the trial or to the competence of the
complainant to testify.  Because of their unreliability and irrelevance,
documents of this kind will be inadmissible in most cases.

 

97                    In addition, there are sound
reasons for not introducing, in criminal matters, the concept of pre-trial discovery
of records held by third parties.  As well as inconveniencing witnesses, who
would have to appear in court on more than one occasion, the procedure
advocated by the respondent would invite fishing expeditions and entail
unnecessary delays.  Moreover, the trial judge would not be in a position,
before the beginning of the trial, to determine the relevance, much less the
admissibility, of the records sought, or to balance effectively the
constitutional rights affected by an order for the production of the records
(see R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, and British Columbia
Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3).

  

 

98                    Consequently, I am not
persuaded that counselling records held by third parties are of such a nature
as to warrant a pre‑trial discovery procedure not available in any other
criminal proceeding.  The proper time for the relevance of the documents to be
ascertained and for the competing rights to be balanced is at trial upon an
application by the accused for an order for production of the records. 

 

99                    It is against this background
that we must now decide whether the trial judge properly disposed of the
motions before him.

 

VIII.Application
to the Case

 

100                  In all fairness, it must be
said at the outset that neither the trial judge nor the parties had the benefit
of this Court's decision in O'Connor, supra, in dealing with the
motions.  However, the matter must be determined in accordance with O'Connor.

 

101                  The record indicates that the
respondent initiated the procedure by subpoena duces tecum coupled with
a notice of motion requesting the judge to order the appellant counselling
institutions to produce to the defence, before the scheduled trial date, all
records relating to the appellant L.L.A.  Although the motion came before a
judge other than the trial judge, it was ultimately dealt with by Loukidelis
J., the trial judge, as it ought to be.  However, the trial judge ought not to
have entertained this motion at the pre-trial stage. As discussed previously,
it is only at the trial that the relevance of such records can be assessed. 
The procedure followed by the respondent in the present case was consequently
not appropriate.  

 

102                  Moreover, notice of the
application for production of the private records was not given to all those
with an interest in the confidentiality of the records.  This encompasses not
only the counselling institutions and the Crown, as was done, but it includes
also the subject of the records, i.e., the sexual assault complainant L.L.A,
who was not notified.  The notification of all interested parties is not merely
elective; failure to make the required notifications is fatal to an application
for production.

 

103                  As well, the trial judge did
not apply the correct evidentiary threshold on the issue of relevance, i.e.,
likely relevance either to an issue in the proceedings or to the competence of
the witness to testify (see O'Connor, supra).  The Crown's
application to quash the subpoenas was dismissed on the ground that ""there
may be information at hand that is relevant to the issue"" without more. 
There is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial judge informed
himself as to the likely relevance of these records either to an issue in the
proceedings or to the competence of the witness to testify.

 

104                  Moreover, as set out in O'Connor,
in determining the likely relevance of the private records, the trial judge
cannot rely upon illegitimate purposes or discriminatory and stereotypical
reasoning.  For instance, an application based on credibility ""at
large"", based on unsupported assertions of ""recent complaint"" or
of ""allegations of sexual abuse by other people"", or based on the
mere fact that a witness has a past psychiatric history or that he or she
received counselling after a sexual assault are all insufficient grounds to
meet the threshold of likely relevance.  In the case at hand, the respondent
argued that ""the records have to be reviewed to determine if there is any
information in there which would be relevant to the trial, credibility of the
complainant, [and] how the information was extracted prior to them going to the
police"".  These grounds do not meet the test for an application for
production of private records held by third parties (see O'Connor). 
This should have been amply sufficient either to dismiss the respondent's
application for production or to allow the Crown's application to quash the subpoena
duces tecum.

 

105                  Having decided to order
production, however, the trial judge, without even reviewing the records to
ensure that only relevant information would be produced, went on to discuss the
appellants' arguments as to privileged communications.  He held that the
confidentiality of the records had to give way to the right of the accused and,
consequently, that the records in question were not privileged and had to be
produced to the defence.  There was no discussion of, on the one side, the
complainant's Charter rights to privacy and to equality without
discrimination and, on the other, the accused's Charter right to make
full answer and defence.  This was also in error.

 

106                  Given that the respondent has
not established the first element of the test for production, namely the likely
relevance of the private records held by the appellant third parties either to
the issues at trial or to the competence of the witness, and that his request
constituted nothing more than a fishing expedition, the trial judge's order
directing the production of those records by the appellants must be quashed.

 

IX.Disposition

 

107                  In the result, I would allow
the appeal, quash the order of the trial judge for the production of the
private records relating to the appellant L.L.A. and held by the other
appellants and remit the matter to the trial judge for the trial to continue.

                   At the request of
the Crown, the trial judge in a sexual assault case ordered a publication ban
as to identity of the complainant under s. 486(3)  and (4)  of the Criminal
Code .  After acquitting the accused, the trial judge on his own motion
rescinded the order on the ground that the complainant's evidence was not
credible.  The order lifting the ban was later stayed pending appeal.  The
Crown appealed from the rescission order directly to this Court under s. 40(1) 
of the Supreme Court Act .  At issue were:  (1) whether or not this
Court had jurisdiction; (2) whether or not the appeal was moot; and
(3) whether or not s. 486(3) and (4) of the Code
authorized a judge to revoke an order banning publication as to a sexual
assault complainant's identity without obtaining the consent of the Crown and
the complainant.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   This Court had
jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, to
grant leave and to hear the appeal.  Since the acquittal was based on a finding
that the Crown had failed to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, the
Crown could not appeal the acquittal under s. 676(1)(a) of the Code. 
Given that an appeal from the rescinding order did not fall under any of the
subsections of s. 676(1) , the trial court was the court of last resort in
the province with respect to the order sought to be appealed.  This Court's
jurisdiction under s. 40(1)  was not precluded by s. 40(3) .  The order
revoking the ban was not a ""judgment . . . acquitting . . . or
affirming . . . [an]  acquittal of an indictable offence"" and
had no bearing whatsoever on the acquittal.

 

                   The case at bar
could not be considered moot.  The dispute between the parties remained
unresolved.  That no news organization had publicized the complainant's name
did not mean that no media outlet would not publish her name at some time if
the ban is lifted.  Even if the appeal were moot, the Court's discretion to
hear the appeal should be exercised because the issue is important and may
affect future cases.

 

                   Nothing in the
language of s. 486(4)  purports to authorize revocation of the order and,
given the purpose of the legislation, no such power can or ought to be
implied.  Subsections (3) and (4) of s. 486 were enacted to encourage victims
to come forward and complain and to facilitate the prosecution and conviction
of those guilty of sexual offences.  The mandatory nature of an order under
s. 486(4)  furthered this goal.  A revocable publication ban, like a
discretionary ban, would not provide the certainty that is necessary to
encourage victims to come forward and so would not achieve Parliament's
objective.  The limited power of a court to reconsider and vary its orders made
as to the trial's conduct was not expressly excluded by s. 486.  Generally, any
order relating to the conduct of a trial can be varied or revoked if the
circumstances that were present at the time the order was made have materially
changed.  In order to be material, the change must relate to a matter that
justified the making of the order in the first place.  Where an order is
required to be made by statute, the circumstances that are relevant are those
whose presence makes the order mandatory.  As long as these circumstances are
present, there cannot be a material change of circumstances.

 

                   Here, the Crown did
not withdraw its application or consent to revocation of the order. 
Accordingly, the circumstances that were present and required the order to be
made had not changed.  The trial judge, therefore, did not have the power to
revoke the order.  Had the Crown but not the complainant consented to the
revocation order, the trial judge would equally have had no authority to
revoke.  The complainant was also entitled to the publication ban even if the
Crown had not applied for it.  If, however, both the Crown and the complainant
consent, then the circumstances which make the publication ban mandatory are no
longer present and, subject to any rights that the accused may have under
s. 486(3) , the trial judge can revoke the order.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

1                 Sopinka
J. -- This appeal concerns the power of a trial judge to rescind a ban
on publication made under s. 486(3)  and (4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  The order banning publication of the name of the
complainant and any information capable of identifying her was issued on
request of the Crown.  After acquitting the respondent, the trial judge on his
own motion rescinded the order on the ground that the complainant's evidence
was not credible.  The Crown appeals from the rescission order on the grounds
that under the Criminal Code  provisions there is no power to rescind
and, if there is, it was not properly exercised in this case.

 

I.  Facts

 

2                 The respondent John Adams was
charged with one count of sexual assault using a weapon, one count of
confining, one count of aggravated assault, one count of threatening and one
count of possession of a weapon.  At the request of the Crown, the trial judge
imposed a ban on the publication of the complainant's name pursuant to s.
486(4)  of the Criminal Code .

 

3                 During the course of the trial,
Feehan J. found that the complainant was a prostitute.  The trial judge further
held that the complainant had agreed to engage in prostitution with Mr.
Adams.    

 

4                 The evidence led at trial was
confusing and contradictory.  While the complainant claimed that Adams had
threatened her with a sword and forced her to perform sexual acts, Adams stated
that he had refused to engage in sexual acts with the complainant upon learning
that she was pregnant.  In addition, Adams claimed that the complainant had
stolen $900 from his wallet, and that when he had discovered that the money was
missing, the complainant became hysterical and attacked him with a sword.

 

5                 After reviewing all of the
evidence before him, Feehan J. found that he was unable to determine exactly
what happened on the night in question.  Neither the complainant nor the
accused had given completely reliable evidence, and the various allegations
could not be verified by independent witnesses.  As a result of these findings,
the trial judge made the following statement:

 

                   There
is an important rule of law which applies in this case as it applies in all
criminal cases and it is known as the presumption of innocence.  To be put
simply, it means that the accused person is presumed to be innocent until the
Crown has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The presumption of
innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case are inseparable.  The onus
or burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt rests
with the Crown, and that burden never shifts.  There is no burden on the
accused to prove his innocence.  The Crown must prove each and every ingredient
of the offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  If a judge believes the
complainant, he may convict.  If he believes the accused, most times he must
acquit, but there is something in between.  If the judge is unsure, if he's not
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that doubt must go to the accused and not
to the Crown.

 

                   All
charges against the accused are dismissed.  I lift the ban on the
publication of the name of the complainant.  [Emphasis added.]

 

At the conclusion of the trial,
counsel for the Crown submitted that the publication ban should not have been
lifted.  The trial judge stayed the revocation of the ban pending a further
hearing of the matter.  At the conclusion of the hearing the trial judge upheld
his revocation order citing his findings that the complainant was a prostitute
and a liar.  The latter was not a finding which appears to have been made at
trial.  Subsequently the order lifting the ban was stayed by Wachowich A.C.J.
pending appeal.

 

II.  Statutory Provisions

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 

 

                          486. ...

 

                   (3) 
Subject to subsection (4), where an accused is charged with an offence under
section 151, 152, 153, 155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272, 273, 346 or
347, the presiding judge or justice may make an order directing that the
identity of the complainant or of a witness and any information that could
disclose the identity of the complainant or witness shall not be published in
any document or broadcast in any way.

 

                   (4) 
The presiding judge or justice shall

 

                   (a)

mentioned in subsection (3) of the right to make an application for an order
under subsection (3); and

 

                   (b) 
on application made by the complainant, the prosecutor or any such witness,

III.  Judgment
Below

 

Alberta
Court of Queen's Bench

 

6                 On
July 21, 1994, Feehan J. addressed the Crown's arguments concerning the
revocation of the publication ban.  Although he was willing to accept that
lifting the ban could deter some individuals from reporting sexual assault, the
judge expressed the view that the primary purpose of the ban was to protect
""innocent"" victims.  In his view, the protection of s. 486(4)  should
extend to ""honest evidence"" only, and should not be applied where the
complainant is ""a liar"" and ""a prostitute"".  

 

7                 Feehan
J. then went on to consider policy reasons in favour of lifting the publication
ban.  In his view:

 

... this woman went into the beer parlor as a predator,
and this fellow says he lost $900.  I didn't make that as a finding of fact,
but he says he lost $900.  

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   Don't we owe society a duty to tell
the next person that goes into that beer parlor for a beer and maybe also
looking for a prostitute, that this is a dangerous one[?]

 

Feehan
J. accordingly held that the protection of s. 486(4)  should not apply in the
case at bar, and upheld his original ruling revoking the publication ban.

 

IV.  Issues

 

8                 The
following issues were raised by the parties:

 

1.Does this Court have jurisdiction to hear this appeal?

 

2.Is this appeal moot?

 

3.Do subss. (3) and (4) of s. 486  of the Criminal
Code  authorize a judge to revoke an order banning publication without
obtaining the consent of the Crown and the complainant?

 

4.If the answer to No. 3 is yes, was the revocation
order properly made in the circumstances of this case?

 

9                 In
view of the conclusion I have reached with respect to the first three issues,
it will not be necessary to deal with the fourth issue.

 

V.  Analysis

 

1.  Jurisdiction

 

10               The
Crown applied for leave to appeal directly to this Court from the order of the
trial judge, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. S-26 .  By reason of the jurisdictional issue raised by the
application, an oral hearing of the leave application was ordered.  A full
bench heard the application which included submissions as to jurisdiction.  The
application was granted without reasons.  The issue of jurisdiction was further
raised on the appeal.  In my view, the Court had jurisdiction to grant leave
and to hear the appeal.

 

11               Section
40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  authorizes an appeal to this Court with
leave of this Court from ""any ... judgment...of the highest court of final
resort in a province, or a judge thereof"".  If the Crown did have the
right to appeal to the Court of Appeal, this Court would lack the jurisdiction
to hear an appeal of the order in question based on s. 40(1)  of the Supreme
Court Act .  It is, therefore, necessary to consider whether the Crown had
the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the order in question.  Appeals
by the Crown in criminal matters are governed by the Criminal Code . 
Section 676(1)  provides as follows:

 

                   676. (1)   The Attorney
General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of
appeal

 

(a)  against a judgment or verdict of acquittal
of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of law alone; or

 

                   (b)  against an order of a
superior court of criminal jurisdiction that quashes an indictment or in any
manner refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction on an indictment;

 

                   (c)  against an order of a
trial court that stays proceedings on an indictment or quashes an indictment;
or

 

(d)  with leave of the court of appeal or a judge
thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by
indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

 

12               The
order in issue was made after the respondent had been acquitted.  The acquittal
was based on the trial judge's conclusion, based on his assessment of the
evidence, that the Crown had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Understandably, the Crown has decided not to attempt to
challenge this finding on appeal.  Since no point of law appeared to be raised,
the Crown could not surmount the jurisdictional hurdle imposed by s. 676(1)(a)
that the appeal involve ""a question of law alone"".  An appeal from
the order itself does not fit within any of the subsections of s. 676(1) and
the trial court is, therefore, the court of last resort in the province with
respect to the order sought to be appealed.  Section 2  of the Supreme Court
Act  defines ""judgment"" as including ""any ... order..."". 
Accordingly, s. 40(1) confers jurisdiction on this Court unless this conclusion
is precluded by s. 40(3)  of the Supreme Court Act .

 

13               Section
40(3) provides as follows:

 

                   40. ...

 

                   (3) No appeal to the Court lies under
this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting
aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or,
except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other
than an indictable offence.

 

14               It
is apparently intended to exclude an appeal under s. 40(3)  of the Supreme
Court Act  of judgments in respect of which an appeal lies by virtue of the Criminal
Code  provisions.  In respect of indictable offences, the subsection
prohibits an appeal from a judgment of any court:

 

                   (1) 
acquitting,

 

                   (2) 
convicting,

 

                   (3) 
setting aside a conviction,

 

                   (4) 
affirming a conviction,

 

                   (5) 
setting aside an acquittal,

 

                   (6) 
affirming an acquittal.

 

The use
of the words ""[n]o appeal to the Court lies under this section""
implies that it was the intention of Parliament to affirm that in the instances
I have listed above the avenues of appeal provided in the Code were to
be followed.  When s. 40(3) (formerly s. 41(3)) was passed in 1949, s. 691
(formerly s. 1023) provided and continues to provide for an appeal to this
Court by the accused from a judgment:

 

                   (a)affirming a conviction (s. 691(1),
formerly s. 1023(1)),

 

                   (b)setting aside an acquittal (s.
691(2), formerly s. 1023(2)).

 

Section
693 (formerly s. 1023) provided and continues to provide for an appeal to this
Court from a judgment:

 

                   (a)setting aside a conviction (s.
693(1), formerly s. 1023(3)),

 

(b)affirming an acquittal (s. 693(1), formerly s. 1023(3)). 
This is expressed as dismissing an appeal taken pursuant to s. 676(1)(a)
(formerly s. 1013), thus affirming the acquittal.

 

15               Accordingly,
these rights of appeal are excluded by items (3), (4), (5) and (6) listed
above.  In 1985, and after s. 40(3) was passed, the avenues of appeal to this
Court by the Crown were expanded under the Criminal Code  to permit an
appeal from a judgment dismissing a Crown appeal from an order of a superior
court (1) quashing an indictment, (2) refusing to exercise jurisdiction on an
indictment, or (3) staying an indictment.  See R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.),
s. 139 (formerly S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 137).  However, s. 40(3) was not up-dated
to reflect this change in the Code. 

 

16               Items
(1) and (2) preclude an appeal under s. 40(1) where an appeal is provided under
the provisions of the Criminal Code  to the Crown from an acquittal (s.
676(1) (a)) and to the accused from conviction (s. 675 ).  When
s. 40(3) was enacted these rights of appeal were contained in s. 1013 of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as amended.

 

17               It
is clear, therefore, that s. 40(3) precludes an appeal that falls within one of
the six categories that I have listed and in respect of which an appeal lies
pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code .  In addition, this
Court has recently held, in R. v. Hinse, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597, that s.
40(3)  extends to any order that is integrally related to one of the
categories.  In concluding that an order made under the ancillary jurisdiction
of a court of appeal pursuant to s. 686(8)  is not integrally related to one of
the kinds of judgments listed in s. 40(3) , the Chief Justice stated (at p.
623):

 

                   However, in my view, when a court of
appeal exercises its power to impose an order under s. 686(8), it is not
rendering an order which constitutes an integral part of a ""judgment of
any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction
or acquittal of an indictable offence"".  Rather, as I shall endeavour to
explain, the court is imposing an order which is by nature ancillary to
the underlying judgment rendered by the court.  As such, I am of the view that
in accordance with a purposive interpretation of ss. 2  and 40(3) , an accused or
the Crown is entitled to seek leave to appeal a s. 686(8) order under this
Court's general jurisdiction as defined in s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act . 
[Emphasis in original.]

 

As a
result, an appeal is precluded by s. 40(3) not only in respect of the six
instances which I have listed but also the vast array of interlocutory orders
and rulings made at trial with respect to the conduct of the proceedings.

 

18               Applying
the foregoing to this appeal, it is manifest that the order revoking the ban
was not a ""judgment ...acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence"".  The order
was made after an acquittal had been ordered and no appeal would lie to the
Court of Appeal from the order itself under the provisions of the Criminal
Code .  The order is not integrally related to the acquittal.  Indeed, it
had no bearing whatsoever on the acquittal.  Accordingly, s. 40(3) is not a bar
and this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  

 

2.  Mootness

 

19               The
respondent submitted that the appeal was moot on the ground that no media
outlet has yet expressed the desire to publish the name of the complainant.  He
submits, therefore, that there is no live controversy and that we should not
exercise our discretion to hear the appeal.

 

20               An
issue of mootness involves a two-stage process.  The first stage requires
consideration of whether a live controversy remains.  In Borowski v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at p. 353, this Court stated:

 

                   The doctrine of mootness is an aspect
of a general policy or practice that a court may decline to decide a case which
raises merely a hypothetical or abstract question.  The general principle
applies when the decision of the court will not have the effect of resolving
some controversy which affects or may affect the rights of the parties.  

 

21               The
second stage applies if no live controversy remains.  The Court must then
consider whether to exercise its discretion to hear the appeal notwithstanding
that it is moot.  In my view, the case at bar cannot be considered moot. 
Clearly, the dispute between the parties remains unresolved.  Although no news
organization has yet deemed the complainant's name to be newsworthy
information, this does not mean that no media outlet will ever wish to publish
the complainant's name if the ban is lifted.  The publicity surrounding this
case increases the likelihood that a news organization might seek to print the
complainant's name.  

 

22               In
any event, even if the appeal were moot I would exercise the Court's discretion
to hear the appeal.  The issue is one that is important and may affect future
cases.  It is in the public interest that the question be resolved.

 

3.  Was
the Order Authorized?

 

23               To
answer this question it is necessary to consider (1) whether the language of s.
486(3)  and (4)  authorizes a judge to revoke the order, and (2) whether the
revocation of the order is supportable on the basis of the exercise of an
inherent power of a court to reconsider an order previously made.  In
approaching the interpretation of any statutory provision, it is prudent to
keep in mind the simple but fundamental instruction offered by the court in Reigate
Rural District Council v. Sutton District Water Co. (1908), 99 L.T.R. 168
(K.B.), at p. 170, and affirmed by this Court in Hirsch v. Protestant Board
of School Commissioners, [1926] S.C.R. 246:

 

... it is always necessary in construing a statute, and
in dealing with the words you find in it, to consider the object with which the
statute was passed, because it enables one to understand the meaning of the
words introduced into the enactment.  

 

This
well-settled rule of statutory interpretation has continued to be followed by
this Court to the present time.

 

24               The
""object and purpose"" of the s. 486  publication ban were considered by
this Court in Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General),
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 122.  In that case, the Court held that the object of the
predecessor to the relevant subsections was to encourage the reporting of
sexual offences.  In addition, the subsections were held to pursue the broader
objective of suppressing criminal activity.  According to Lamer J. (as he then
was) for the Court, at p. 130:

 

Encouraging victims to come forward and complain
facilitates the prosecution and conviction of those guilty of sexual offences. 
Ultimately, the overall objective of the publication ban ...is to favour the
suppression of crime and to improve the administration of justice.

 

These
objectives were held to be ""pressing and substantial"" within the
meaning of s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

25               According
to the Court in Canadian Newspapers, the mandatory nature of an order
under s. 486  serves to further the goal of encouraging the reporting of sexual
offences.  As Lamer J. stated, at pp. 131-32:

 

                   When considering all of the evidence
adduced by appellant, it appears that, of the most serious crimes, sexual
assault is one of the most unreported.  The main reasons stated by those who do
not report this offence are fear of treatment by police or prosecutors, fear of
trial procedures and fear of publicity or embarrassment.  Section [486] is one
of the measures adopted by Parliament to remedy this situation, the rationale
being that a victim who fears publicity is assured, when deciding whether to
report the crime or not, that the judge must prohibit upon request the
publication of the complainant's identity or any information that could
disclose it.

 

In
addition, the Court pointed out that complainants must be certain that
their names will not be published in order for the object of the publication
ban to be achieved.  According to Lamer J., at p. 132:

 

Obviously, since fear of publication is one of the
factors that influences the reporting of sexual assault, certainty with respect
to non-publication at the time of deciding whether to report plays a
vital role in that decision.  Therefore, a discretionary provision under which
the judge retains the power to decide whether to grant or refuse the ban on
publication would be counterproductive, since it would deprive the victim of
that certainty.  Assuming that there would be a lesser impairment of freedom of
the press if the impugned provision were limited to a discretionary power, it
is clear, in my view, that such a measure would not, however, achieve
Parliament's objective, but rather defeats it.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Lamer J.
went on to hold that a ""discretionary ban is not an option as it is not
effective in attaining Parliament's pressing goal"" (pp. 132-33).  As a
result, the mandatory nature of the publication ban was not only necessary to
ensure certainty for the complainant, but it was also necessary in order for
the section to achieve Parliament's objective.  Had the order in question been
merely discretionary, s. 486  might not have survived the ""rational
connection"" branch of the Oakes test.

 

26               A
revocable publication ban, like a discretionary ban, would fail to provide the
certainty that is necessary to encourage victims to come forward.  If the trial
judge were given the power by the legislation to revoke the ban, the
complainant would never be certain that her anonymity would be protected.  The
ban would serve as little more than a temporary guarantee of anonymity.  There
is nothing in the language of s. 486(4)  that purports to authorize revocation
of the order and, given the purpose of the legislation, no such power can or
ought to be implied.

 

27               The
respondent submits, however, that there is nothing in the section that prevents
a judge from reconsidering and, if appropriate, from revoking the order. 
Reliance is, therefore, placed on the inherent power of a trial judge to
reconsider, vary or rescind previous orders made during the course of trial.

 

28               I
agree with the respondent that nothing in the language of s. 486  of the Criminal
Code  expressly excludes any power possessed by a court to reconsider an
order made under s. 486(3)  and (4) .  These provisions address the making of the
order but do not deal with whether the order is reviewable after it has been
made.  It is, therefore, not inconsistent with the interpretation of these
subsections to hold that, whatever inherent power to reconsider resides in a
court, survives.  Indeed, as I shall point out hereafter, it may be desirable
and in keeping with the purpose and objects of the section to permit
reconsideration and revocation of the order if the circumstances which
justified its making have ceased to exist.  It is, therefore, necessary to
consider what authority a judge has to reconsider a previous order and its
application to the circumstances of this case.  

 

29               A
court has a limited power to reconsider and vary its judgment disposing of the
case as long as the court is not functus.  The court continues to be
seized of the case and is not functus until the formal judgment has been
drawn up and entered.  See Oley v. City of Fredericton (1983), 50 N.B.R.
(2d) 196 (C.A.).  With respect to orders made during trial relating to the
conduct of the trial, the approach is less formalistic and more flexible. 
These orders generally do not result in a formal order being drawn up and the
circumstances under which they may be varied or set aside are also less rigid. 
The ease with which such an order may be varied or set aside will depend on the
importance of the order and the nature of the rule of law pursuant to which the
order is made.  For instance, if the order is a discretionary order pursuant to
a common law rule, the precondition to its variation or revocation will be less
formal.  On the other hand, an order made under the authority of statute will
attract more stringent conditions before it can be varied or revoked.  This
will apply with greater force when the initial making of the order is
mandatory.

 

30               As
a general rule, any order relating to the conduct of a trial can be varied or
revoked if the circumstances that were present at the time the order was made
have materially changed.  In order to be material, the change must relate to a
matter that justified the making of the order in the first place.  In R. v.
Khela, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 201, this Court had occasion to consider this issue
in relation to an order requiring the Crown to disclose pursuant to the
principles in this Court's decision in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 326.  In the majority reasons the following statement was made with
respect to the proper approach to reconsideration of such an order (at pp.
210-11):

 

Where new evidence which may warrant a change in the
terms of the Crown's obligation to disclose comes into the possession of the
Crown, the appropriate procedure is an application to the trial judge to vary. 
The trial judge has a discretion to vary an order for disclosure on the basis
of evidence which establishes that the factual foundation upon which the order
was based has changed.  Such an application should be made at the earliest
opportunity.  Difficulties in compliance with disclosure orders should be
resolved by application to vary disclosure obligations rather than by
non-compliance followed by an attempt at ex post facto justification on
the basis of alleged new circumstances.

 

Where an
order is required to be made by statute, the circumstances that are relevant
are those whose presence makes the order mandatory.  As long as these
circumstances are present, there cannot be a material change of circumstances.

 

31               Subsections
(3) and (4) of s. 486  make the order banning publication mandatory on the
application of the prosecution, the complainant or a witness under the age of
18.  In this case, the circumstance that made the order mandatory was an
application by the prosecutor.  The Crown did not withdraw its application or
consent to revocation of the order.  Accordingly, the circumstances that were
present and required the order to be made had not changed.  The trial judge,
therefore, did not have the power to revoke the order.

 

32               While
this conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this case, it is useful to add
that, had the Crown consented to the revocation order but the complainant did
not, the trial judge would equally have had no authority to revoke.  The
complainant was also entitled to the publication ban even if the Crown had not applied
for it.  If, however, both the Crown and the complainant consent, then the
circumstances which make the publication ban mandatory are no longer present
and, subject to any rights that the accused may have under s. 486(3) , the trial
judge can revoke the order.  There may be circumstances in which the facts are
such that both the Crown and the complainant conclude, after hearing the
evidence or some of it, that the public interest and that of the complainant
are better served if the facts are published. 

 

33               It
might still be argued that a witness might object to the revocation.  Whether
such an objection would prevail requires considerable speculation as to the
nature of the order, whether revocation would disclose the identity of the
witness and whether the witness is one that the section is designed to
protect.  I would leave for another day the question whether every witness
under 18 years of age could insist on the ban being maintained against the
wishes of the Crown and the complainant.  As well, I would not rule out the
traditional power of a court to set aside or review an order that has been
obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.  No such issue arises here and I would
prefer to leave consideration of the exercise of this power to a case in which
the point is raised directly.

 

34               In
the result, the appeal is allowed, the order of the trial judge dated June 17,
1994 and affirmed on July 21, 1994 is set aside and the order banning
publication dated June 14, 1994 is restored.

                   The accused was
charged with sexual assault and indecent assault.  The complainant's mother had
died when the complainant was four years old, leaving her to the care of her
father, an admitted alcoholic.  She spent the next years living in a variety of
arrangements, some of the time with her father.  The alleged assaults occurred
when the complainant was either living with or visiting her father, who was a
friend of the accused.  The complainant's allegations against the accused came
to light after she had been charged with sexually abusing five young boys while
baby‑sitting them.  While receiving counselling and psychological care as
a result of these charges, she revealed that she herself had been sexually
abused.  She testified at trial that she had told no one about the incidents at
the time for fear of being disbelieved and losing her father.  The
complainant's psychiatrist testified that the complainant was sexually abused
and explained why he held that opinion.  The accused did not testify at trial. 
He was convicted on both counts.  The Court of Appeal set aside the convictions
and ordered a new trial.  In the court's view, the complainant's evidence was
not overwhelming.  Without saying that the complainant should not have been
believed, the court held that the accused was entitled to assume that the trial
judge would either apply the doctrine of reasonable doubt to the evidence and
acquit him, or at least explain why the evidence did not raise a reasonable
doubt, something which the trial judge had not done.  This appeal is to
determine whether the Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the trial judge's
conclusion that the complainant was credible and in concluding that the trial
judge did not err in his decisions on the admissibility or use of evidence.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and the convictions restored.

 

                   In determining
whether a trial judge's verdict is unreasonable or one that cannot be supported
on the evidence, under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code ,
a court of appeal is entitled to review the evidence, re‑examining it and
re‑weighing it, but only for the purpose of determining if it is
reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's conclusion.  Provided this
threshold test is met, the court is not to substitute its view for that of the
trial judge or permit doubts it may have to persuade it to order a new trial. 
The Court of Appeal in this case held that a finding of guilty might be ""a
perfectly acceptable result"", and thus should not have set aside the trial
judge's verdict.  Failure to indicate expressly that all relevant
considerations have been taken into account in arriving at a verdict is not a
basis for allowing an appeal.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
was correct in holding that there was no merit in the accused's objections to
certain evidentiary points at trial.  The psychiatrist's evidence as to sexual
abuse suffered by the complainant was not unnecessary or unfair.  The general
rule is that expert evidence is admissible to furnish the court with scientific
information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the
judge and jury, and the use of experts to explain human behaviour may fall
within this rule.  The psychiatrist's relation of the history of abuse given to
him by the complainant is not inadmissible as hearsay, since the statements in
question were not tendered for the truth of their contents, but rather in
support of his diagnosis of the complainant's mental state and his explanation
of her behaviour.  Nor did his evidence violate the rule against oath‑helping
since it was directed to legitimate purposes having nothing to do with whether
the complainant was credible or not.

                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 124, 15
B.C.A.C. 264, 27 W.A.C. 264, quashing the accused's convictions on charges of
sexual assault and indecent assault and ordering a new trial.  Appeal allowed
and convictions restored.

 

                   Alexander Budlovsky, for the appellant.

 

                   Henry S. Brown, Q.C., for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- The respondent
Burns was convicted on one count of sexual assault and one count of indecent
assault before a trial judge, sitting alone.  The Court of Appeal of British
Columbia quashed the convictions and directed a new trial.  The Crown now
appeals from that order.

 

                   The facts may be
briefly stated.  The complainant was born on August  27, 1971.  Her mother died
when she was four years of age, leaving her to the care of her father, an
admitted alcoholic.  She spent the next years living in a variety of
arrangements.  For some of the time she lived with her father.  She also lived
for part of her young life with her father and his new wife and her son, and
then just with the new wife and her son.  Twice she was consigned to foster
homes. 

 

                   The alleged
assaults occurred when the complainant was either living with or visiting her
father.  The complainant's father and Burns were friends; in this way the two
came into contact.

 

                   The complainant's
allegations against Burns came to light after she had been charged with
sexually abusing five young boys while baby-sitting them.  As a result of these
charges, she received counselling and psychological care.  At this time, she
revealed that she herself had been sexually abused.

 

                   The complainant
testified at trial that in or about 1980, Burns had driven her to a sideroad
and had indecently assaulted her.  She said another incident occurred in Burns'
car about four years later.  A third incident occurred, she said, about a year
to a year and a half after that.  In addition, she testified that acts of
sexual touching without her consent continued throughout the time period when
Burns was alone with her in her father's mobile home.  She said that in 1987,
while she was alone in the home, Burns entered and forcibly had sexual
intercourse with her.  The complainant testified that she told no one about
these incidents at the time for fear of being disbelieved and losing her
father.

 

                   The complainant's
psychiatrist, Dr. Maddess, testified as to her condition as a consequence of
what she had allegedly undergone, giving a picture of why she would have
reacted as she said she did.  Burns did not testify at trial.  Evidence of a
statement he had made to the police was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge.

 

Judgments Below

 

Trial Judge

 

                   The trial judge
gave brief oral reasons at the conclusion of the trial.  After reviewing the
evidence, he concluded as follows:

 

                   I
had the opportunity to hear the evidence of [the complainant] and to observe
her demeanour in the witness stand.  Although she was not sure of the exact
dates of the specific acts and was confused as to some of the continuing
events, she did present her evidence in an honest and straightforward manner,
without equivocation.  She was in my opinion a credible and believable
witness.  I accept her evidence as to the alleged indecent assaults from 1980
to 1983, and I also accept her evidence as to the sexual assault that occurred
in January of 1987.

 

                   Based
upon that evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
is guilty on both counts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court of Appeal

 

 

                   The Court of Appeal
set aside the convictions and directed a new trial: (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d)
124.  According to the court, there were a number of reasons why the evidence
of the complainant required careful scrutiny  and therefore it was not
surprising that the accused declined to testify.  The Crown's case depended
almost entirely upon the credibility of the complainant and her evidence was
not, in the view of the Court of Appeal, overwhelming.  Without saying that the
complainant should not have been believed, the court, per McEachern
C.J.B.C.,  held that the respondent was entitled to assume that the trial judge
would either apply the doctrine of reasonable doubt to the evidence and acquit
the respondent, or at least explain why the evidence did not raise a reasonable
doubt.  This he found the trial judge had not done.  After referring to
""serious questions"" arising from the evidence,  McEachern C.J.B.C.
concluded as follows (at p. 132):

 

                   I
wish to stress that I do not say the accused should have been acquitted.  That
is the responsibility of the trial judge, and I would not presume to prejudge
that question.  I tend to believe that a finding of guilty on a careful
weighing of all of the evidence, and a proper analysis of all relevant issues,
may be a perfectly acceptable result.

 

                   The
reasons for judgment, however, do not permit me to determine whether the
learned trial judge properly directed himself to all the evidence and legal
questions bearing upon the relevant issues as required by Harper [[1982]
1 S.C.R. 2].  This does not result simply because the learned trial judge did
not give more extensive reasons, but rather because he subsumed so many issues
in his findings of credibility that it is impossible to say whether the
doctrine of reasonable doubt, the `thin golden thread of the law', was given
proper weight in this case.

 

                   The
foregoing is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, and to persuade me that the
appeal must be allowed, and a new trial ordered.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
also rejected the submissions that the trial judge erred in permitting the
Crown to adduce unnecessary and unfair expert evidence, in receiving hearsay
evidence in support of Dr. Maddess' opinion, in receiving evidence described as
oath-helping, in permitting the Crown to adduce so much evidence about Burns'
failed polygraph test in a voir dire designed to establish the
voluntariness of a post-polygraph statement, and in allowing the accused's
statement to be treated as an inculpatory statement.

 

Issues on Appeal

 

                   This appeal raises
two issues:

 

(1) 
Did the Court of Appeal err in setting aside the trial judge's conclusion that
the complainant was credible?

 

(2)
Did the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the trial judge did not err in
his decisions on admissibility or use of evidence? 

 

 

Analysis

 

(1)Setting
Aside the Trial Judge's Conclusion that the Complainant was Credible

 

                   The trial judge
believed the complainant and said that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt of the accused's guilt.  The Court of Appeal had doubts about the credibility
of the complainant and, unable to satisfy itself from the trial judge's reasons
that he had considered the factors which led to these doubts, set aside the
trial judge's findings of credibility and guilt and directed a new trial. The
Court of Appeal's reasons raise two intertwined legal questions: (a) when may a
court of appeal interfere with a trier of fact's conclusions on credibility;
and (b) the need for a trial judge's reasons to address specific concerns. 
Although the two questions intertwine in this case, for reasons of convenience
I shall consider each separately.

 

                   (a) Interfering
with the Trier of Fact's Conclusions on Credibility

 

                   

                   Section 686(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , permits a court of appeal
to allow an appeal in three cases:

 

686. (1)  . . . the court of appeal 

 

(a)
may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

(i)
the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
be supported by the evidence,

 

(ii)
the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or

 

(iii)
on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

 

 

                   It is not suggested
that a case for miscarriage of justice was made out.  Nor did the Court of
Appeal find an error of law by the trial judge.  The question therefore is
whether the trial judge's verdict was unreasonable or one that cannot be
supported on the evidence: s. 686(1) (a)(i).

 

                   In proceeding under
s. 686(1) (a)(i), the court of appeal is entitled to review the evidence,
re-examining it and re-weighing it, but only for the purpose of determining if
it is reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's conclusion; that is,
determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably have reached the
conclusion it did on the evidence before it: R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2
S.C.R. 168;  R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122.  Provided this
threshold test is met, the court of appeal is not to substitute its view for
that of the trial judge, nor permit doubts it may have to persuade it to order
a new trial.  

 

                   The Court of Appeal
in this case reviewed the evidence fully, as it was entitled to do.  This
review, however, did not lead it to conclude that the trial judge's conclusion
was unreasonable, nor that it could not be supported by the evidence.   Indeed,
McEachern C.J.B.C.  conceded the contrary when he said ""I tend to believe
that a finding of guilty on a careful weighing of all of the evidence, and a
proper analysis of all relevant issues, may be a perfectly acceptable
result"" (p. 132).  This is tantamount to saying that there was sufficient
evidence to reasonably support a conviction.  That being the case, the Court of
Appeal should not have set aside the verdict of the trial judge. 

 

                   (b) Insufficiency
of Reasons

 

                   The Court of
Appeal's main concern was not that there was insufficient evidence to support
the verdicts of guilty, nor that those verdicts were unreasonable, but that the
trial judge's reasons failed to indicate that he had considered certain
frailties in the complainant's evidence.  Given the brevity of the trial
judge's reasons, they could not be sure that he had properly considered all
relevant matters.

 

                   Failure to indicate
expressly that all relevant considerations have been taken into account in
arriving at a verdict is not a basis for allowing an appeal under s. 686(1) (a). 
This accords with the general rule that a trial judge does not err merely
because he or she does not give reasons for deciding one way or the other on
problematic points: see R. v. Smith, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 991, affirming
(1989), 95 A.R. 304, and Macdonald v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R.  665. 
The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she knows the law and has
considered all aspects of the evidence.  Nor is the judge required to explain
why he or she does not entertain a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. 
Failure to do any of these things does not, in itself, permit a court of appeal
to set aside the verdict.

 

                   This rule makes
good sense.  To require trial judges charged with heavy caseloads of criminal
cases to deal in their reasons with every aspect of every case would slow the
system of justice immeasurably.  Trial judges are presumed to know the law with
which they work day in and day out.  If they state their conclusions in brief
compass, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict
should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects
of the case. 

 

                   The Court of Appeal
relied on the following passage from Harper v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 2, where this Court stated (at p. 14):

 

Where
the record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of
appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the complete disregard
of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede.

 

                   This statement
should not be read as placing on trial judges a positive duty to demonstrate in
their reasons that they have completely appreciated each aspect of relevant
evidence.  The statement does not refer to the case where the trial judge has
failed to allude to difficulties in the evidence, but rather to the case where
the trial judge's reasons demonstrate that he or she has failed to grasp an
important point or has chosen to disregard it, leading to the conclusion that
the verdict was not one which the trier of fact could reasonably have reached. 

 

                   McEachern C.J.B.C.
did not suggest that the trial judge had demonstrated a misapprehension or a
total failure to appreciate the evidence.  Rather, he said only that the
subsumption of so many issues within the trial judge's finding on credibility
left him unable to say whether the doctrine of reasonable doubt had been
applied.  These conclusions do not bring the case within Harper, as I
read that case.

 

(2) Evidentiary Points

 

                   The balance of the
respondent Burns' objections to the trial concerned evidentiary points.  The
Court of Appeal held that there was no merit in any of them.  I agree.

 

                   Three of the
objections concerned the evidence of the psychiatrist, Dr. Maddess.  It was
first objected that Dr. Maddess' evidence as to sexual abuse suffered by the
complainant was unnecessary and unfair, it being obvious from the complainant's
own evidence that she had indeed been sexually abused by her stepbrother.  I
agree with the Court of Appeal that this objection cannot be sustained.  Dr.
Maddess testified that the complainant was sexually abused and explained why he
held that opinion.  He also explained some of the symptoms displayed in the
behaviour of sexually abused children, which, without expert testimony, may be
difficult if not impossible to understand. 

 

                   The general rule is
that expert evidence is admissible to furnish the court with scientific
information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the
judge and jury: R. v. Marquard, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, at p. 243 (per
McLachlin J.); R. v. Béland, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 398, at p. 415 (per
McIntyre J.); R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24, at p. 42 (per
Dickson J.).  The use of experts to explain human behaviour may fall within
this rule.  The behaviour of a person who has been systematically abused is one
example of a matter on which experts may assist.  This use of expert evidence was
approved by this Court in R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, where
expert evidence of the reactions and behaviour of a woman who had been
repeatedly battered by her companion was admitted:  see Wilson J.'s reasons at
pp. 870-72.

 

                   The respondent does
not argue that psychiatric evidence bearing on a witness's behaviour is for
that reason inadmissible.  His objection is that  ""the opinion of Dr.
Maddess went to the very root of the issue before the learned trial judge""
and that ""allowing that opinion usurped the function of the trial
judge"":  the so-called ""ultimate issue rule"".  However, the
jurisprudence does not support such a strict application of this rule.  While
care must be taken to ensure that the judge or jury, and not the expert, makes
the final decisions on all issues in the case, it has long been accepted that
expert evidence on matters of fact should not be excluded simply because it
suggests answers to issues which are at the core of the dispute before the
court: Graat v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819.  See also Khan v.
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 641
(C.A.), at p. 666 (per Doherty J.A).

 

                   The second
objection to Dr. Maddess' evidence is that Dr. Maddess' relation of the history
of abuse given to him by the complainant was hearsay.  The short answer to this
objection is that the statements in question were not tendered for the truth of
their contents, but rather in support of Dr. Maddess' diagnosis of the
complainant's mental state and his explanation of her behaviour.   The
complainant testified to the history of abuse against her.  The statements to
Dr. Maddess were therefore admissible to support his diagnosis:  Wilband v.
The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 14; R. v. Rosik (1970), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 351
(Ont. C.A.);  Phillion v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 18;  R. v. Abbey,
supra; R. v. Lavallee, supra.  In assessing the weight to
be placed on Dr. Maddess' opinion, the trial judge was required to take into
account that it was founded in part on hearsay evidence:  Lavallee, supra,
at p. 896.  However, there is no reason to suppose that the trial judge failed
to do so.        

 

                   The third objection
to Dr. Maddess' evidence was to a question and answer which was said to violate
the rule against oath-helping:

 

Q.Did
at any time as far as you were aware she tell you something which was untrue?

 

                   A.Not
that I am aware of.

 

 

                   The rule against
oath-helping holds that evidence adduced solely for the purpose of proving that
a witness is truthful is inadmissible:  R. v. Marquard, supra. 
The rule finds its origins in the medieval practice of oath-helping; the
accused in a criminal case or the defendant in a civil case could prove his
innocence by providing a certain number of compurgators to swear to the truth
of his oath: see R. v. Béland, supra, per Wilson J. at pp.
419-20.  In modern times, it is defended on the ground that determinations of
credibility are for the trier of fact, and that the judge or jurors are in as
good a position to determine credibility as another witness.  Therefore the
fundamental requirement for expert evidence -- that it assist the judge or jury
on a technical or scientific matter which might otherwise not be apparent -- is
not met.  The rule, as Iacobucci J. noted in R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1
S.C.R. 697, at p. 729, goes to evidence ""that would tend to prove the
truthfulness of the witness, rather than the truth of the witness'
statements"".  

 

                   Dr. Maddess'
evidence does not violate the rule because it was directed to legitimate
purposes having nothing to do with whether the complainant was credible or
not.  The fact that evidence may be inadmissible for one purpose (i.e. showing
the truthfulness of a witness) does not prevent it being received for another,
legitimate purpose.  The evidence of Dr. Maddess in the impugned passage was
admissible for the purpose of supporting the opinions Dr. Maddess expressed on
other matters, such as his diagnosis of the complainant's condition and his
explanation of her behaviour.  His conclusions were based in large part on what
she had told him.  Those conclusions would be weakened if not invalidated if he
did not believe what she had told him.  So it was relevant to determine whether
he believed her or not.  See Taylor J.A. in R. v. Wild (1993), 24
B.C.A.C. 241, at pp. 247-48; R. J. Delisle, ""Children as Witnesses: The
Problems Persist"" (1994), 25 C.R. (4th) 39, at p. 44.  I conclude that the
impugned question and answer were admissible for the purpose of providing a
foundation for Dr. Maddess' opinions.  It follows that they did not offend the
rule against oath-helping.  

 

                   There is nothing in
the trial judge's reasons to suggest that he used the question and answer for
the inference that the complainant was a truthful witness.  He lists a number
of factors relevant to her credibility; this is not among them. His reasons
suggest that he was exercising his own independent judgment on the
complainant's truthfulness, rather than relying on the opinions of others. 
Moreover, the evidence had been objected to on the ground that it was
oath-helping.  The trial judge had therefore been alerted to the impermissible
use of the evidence and must be presumed to have borne this in mind.  In short,
there is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial judge used the
statement to bolster the complainant's credibility; indeed the inference is to
the contrary.  

 

                   Two other
reproaches made against the trial judge may be dismissed summarily.  It was
objected that counsel and the trial judge erred in treating a statement by
Burns as to consensual sex with the complainant as inculpatory rather than
exculpatory.  The statement was excluded as involuntary after a voir dire. 
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge did not err in treating
the statement as inculpatory.  Likewise, the suggestion that too much evidence
about Burns' failed polygraph test was permitted  in the voir dire on
the admissibility of the post-polygraph statement has no merit; as the Court of
Appeal below pointed out, the judge proceeded properly and must be presumed to
have disabused his mind of this evidence in considering the merits of the case.

 

Conclusion

                   

                   I would allow the
appeal and restore the convictions.

                   Respondent was
charged with impaired driving following a motor vehicle collision where one of
his passengers was killed and another two injured.  The constable attending at
the accident advised respondent of his s. 10 Charter rights to be
promptly informed of the reasons for his arrest and to retain and instruct
counsel.  He then formally demanded a breathalyzer sample from respondent who
smelled of alcohol and was staggering.  The constable in charge of respondent
at the police station inquired as to whether he understood his right to contact
counsel and helped him to do so.  Both respondent and his lawyer knew that one
of the passengers had died at the time of their first telephone consultation. 
After the consultation, respondent initially refused to provide a breath sample
but relented when advised by the police that he would be charged with refusing
to provide a sample.  The lawyer and respondent consulted again before a second
breath sample was taken.

 

                   At trial,
respondent's lawyer objected to the admission of the results of the breath
samples on the ground that the police had violated respondent's s. 10 Charter
rights.  The trial judge, on a voir dire, concluded respondent's Charter
rights had been violated because he had not been made aware of the extent of
the jeopardy which he faced before his consultation with his lawyer.  He
decided that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter
for its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
Crown counsel declined to call further evidence and the trial judge charged the
jury to acquit.  The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the acquittal. 
At issue here was whether, with respect to a verdict on a trial by judge and
jury, s. 686(4)  of the  Criminal Code  (which deals with the power
of courts of appeal on appeals from acquittals either to uphold the acquittal
or to order a new trial) included a residual discretion for a court of appeal
to refuse to order a new trial where there was an error at trial which could
reasonably have affected the verdict.

 

                   Held (Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

Gonthier and McLachlin JJ.:  No abuse of process occurred here.  Furthermore,
s. 686(4) of the Criminal Code  does not confer any discretion on a
court of appeal other than the discretion to dismiss or allow an appeal.  As a
matter of law, principle and policy, the court of appeal is not empowered to
inquire into prosecutorial discretion.

 

                   In criminal cases,
courts have a residual discretion to remedy an abuse of the court's process but
only in the ""clearest of cases"" ‑‑ i.e., conduct which
shocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper
administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention.  The evidence
must be overwhelming that the proceedings under scrutiny are unfair to the
point that they are contrary to the interest of justice.  Since the Attorney
General through his or her prosecutorial function expresses the community's
sense of justice, the courts should be careful before attempting to
""second‑guess"" the prosecutor's motives when he or she makes a
decision.  Where there is conspicuous evidence of improper motives or of bad
faith or of an act so wrong that it violates the conscience of the community
such that it would genuinely be unfair and indecent to proceed, then, and only
then, should courts intervene to prevent an abuse of process which could bring
the administration of justice into disrepute.  Cases of this nature will be
extremely rare.

 

                   Here, the conduct
of the prosecution did not meet the high threshold required to constitute an
abuse of process.  There was no evidence that the Crown prosecutor's conduct
was prompted by bad faith or an improper motive, nor did the prosecution intend
to frustrate the administration of justice or even to circumvent the rules of
criminal law regarding interlocutory appeals.  Misconduct of such a nature as
to shock the community's sense of fairness or to warrant the application of the
doctrine of abuse of process was not established by the Crown's decision not to
adduce further evidence. 

 

                   Section 686(4) 
of the Criminal Code  does not confer a court of appeal with any
discretion, however limited, beyond the general power to control its process in
case of abuse.  The jurisprudence does not support such an extension of
discretion and no policy consideration warrants such a broad interpretation of
s. 686(4) .  Quite the contrary.  It is contrary not only to the rule of
law but also to the good and efficient administration of justice for the courts
of appeal to invade the exclusive domain of the Crown and to interfere with prosecutorial
discretion.  The courts' reluctance to interfere with prosecutorial discretion
stems from the doctrine of separation of powers where the criminal law is in
the domain of the executive.  Further, the judicial review of prosecutorial
discretion could involve the Crown's disclosing the reasons underlying its
conduct of a case.  Such disclosure could generate masses of documents for
review, adversely affect the flexibility that derives from prosecutorial
confidentiality, and involve the courts in potentially extensive exercises in
""second‑guessing"" a prosecutor's judgment in order to determine
if the reasons behind his or her judgment were merely a subterfuge.  The Crown
cannot function as a prosecutor before the court while also serving under its
general supervision and the court, in turn, cannot both supervise the exercise
of prosecutorial discretion and act as an impartial arbitrator of the case
presented to it.  Even if a discretion to review prosecutorial decisions did
exist, the Court of Appeal should have ordered a new trial.

 

                   The only evidence
which the Court of Appeal could and did assess was the evidence presented at
the voir dire and at the preliminary inquiry.  It is highly speculative
to conjecture about the verdict based on this evidence.  Evidence led at a voir
dire to establish admissibility does not assist in the determination of the
innocence or guilt.  It does not touch upon the determination of guilt or
innocence but rather deals with facts that have nothing to do with the
commission of the offence, such as the means by which the relevant evidence was
obtained.  On a preliminary hearing, the Crown has the discretion to present
only that evidence which makes out a prima facie case.  Speculation
about the verdict cannot serve as the basis for review of an exercise of
prosecutorial discretion that falls short of an abuse of process.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
should have ordered a new trial on the basis that the excluded evidence was
crucial to the Crown's case.  Once the breathalyzer evidence was ruled
inadmissible, any further evidence that might have been led would not
necessarily have assisted the Crown in proving that the respondent's ability to
drive was in fact impaired.  Without the breathalyzer evidence, the Crown in
all probability would have been unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
respondent's ability to drive was impaired.  This element is crucial in cases
of impaired driving causing death or bodily harm.  Furthermore, this evidence
was of the utmost importance because it seemed that the respondent was raising
alternative causes for the accident, such as road and weather conditions and
the mechanical repair of the car.

 

                   Per Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ.
(dissenting):  Although s. 686(4) of the Criminal Code  does not
specify the grounds upon which a Crown appeal from acquittal may be taken,
s. 676(1) (a) provides that an appeal lies from an acquittal on any
ground that involves a question of law alone.  Their combined effect is that
the Court of Appeal ""may"" allow the appeal.  This confers a
discretion on the court which is not statutorily defined.  The Crown,
notwithstanding an error of law, has the obligation of satisfying the Court of
Appeal that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same absent the
error.

 

                   Cases where the
Crown calls all of its evidence can arguably differ from those where the Crown
deliberately chooses to bring about a directed verdict by not calling available
evidence.  The test in Vézeau v. The Queen for the exercise of the
discretion conferred by s. 686(4) does not exhaust the definition of that
discretion so as to preclude the Court, in appropriate circumstances, from
adding to or qualifying the application of that test.  Jurisprudence supports a
limited discretion on the part of the Court of Appeal to decline to allow an
appeal in some circumstances where the Crown unreasonably shuts down its case
with the result that a verdict of acquittal is directed.  Apart from the
capacity to stay for abuse of process, an appellate court is entitled to consider
whether the Crown has acted unreasonably in refusing to call further evidence
at trial because of an adverse evidentiary ruling and can refuse to order a new
trial in such circumstances.  The threshold requirement is that, apart from the
evidence excluded, the Crown's case was sufficient to be put to the jury.  This
threshold is met when the Crown's remaining evidence meets the essential
elements of the offence, but the Crown chooses not to call that evidence.  The
final determination will depend upon a weighing of other factors, including the
relative strength of the evidence not called, the relative importance of the
evidence excluded by the impugned ruling, the degree of prejudice which further
proceedings present to the accused and the reasons for the decision of the
Crown not to call further evidence.

 

                   As a general rule a
decision to shut down the Crown's case simply to appeal an adverse ruling will
be held to be unreasonable.  On the other hand, where the evidence which has
been excluded is relatively important and the remaining evidence, although
perhaps sufficient to make out a prima facie case, is so weak that the
prosecutor concludes that continuing with the trial is a waste of time, a
decision to terminate the proceedings may be reasonable.  Any special prejudice
over and above prejudice that can be inferred from any prolongation of criminal
proceedings will be, if proved, an important factor to be weighed by the Court
of Appeal.  This discretion must be exercised sparingly.

 

                   In considering the
other evidence which the appellant decided not to call, it is necessary to
identify the elements of the offence in question and to consider whether the
other evidence was sufficient to warrant putting the appellant's case to the
jury.  In reaching this determination, the test to be applied is whether the
other evidence, ""if believed by a properly charged jury acting reasonably,
would justify a conviction"".  Here, to substantiate its case, the
appellant would have to demonstrate that:  (i) the respondent was
operating the vehicle in question; (ii) the respondent's ability to drive
was impaired by alcohol; and, (iii) the impaired driving ability of the
respondent caused the deaths and bodily harm which occurred.

 

                   The eye witnesses
provided ample evidence of respondent's driving and could testify to a number
of factors sufficient to establish his impaired state without resort to
breathalyzer evidence.  The Crown, to prove causation, had to adduce sufficient
evidence to demonstrate respondent's impairment was at least a contributing
cause of death and injury, outside the de minimis range.  The issue of
causation requires consideration of competing theories as to the explanation
for occurrence of the accident which resulted in injury and death.  Impairment
need not be shown to be the sole cause in order to convict, since it may well
be that, even though a combination of factors was involved, impairment was
still more than a de minimis cause of the death and injury which
occurred.  Here, the additional evidence of impairment lent to the case by the
breathalyzer would not have had a significant effect on the role played by road
conditions and mechanical disrepair, nor was it essential to establishing the
respondent's impairment.

                   APPEAL from a
judgment of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal (1993), 105 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
271, 331 A.P.R. 271, 81 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 45 M.V.R. (2d) 214, dismissing an appeal
from acquittal by Aylward J. sitting with jury.  Appeal allowed, Sopinka,
Cory and Major JJ. dissenting.

 

                   Wayne Gorman, for the appellant.

 

                   David Orr, for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J. --
This appeal concerns the interpretation and application of s. 686(4)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , to the facts of the case.  The sole issue is
whether the Court of Appeal erred in entering a verdict of acquittal instead of
ordering a new trial for the respondent after it concluded that the trial judge
had committed an error of law in excluding breathalyzer evidence which was
admissible. 

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal, Goodridge C.J. dissenting, dismissed the Crown's appeal of
respondent's acquittal on the ground that there had been an abuse of process in
that, instead of proceeding with the trial, the Crown, unreasonably in their
view, declined to call further evidence which resulted in the acquittal of
respondent on all counts.  My colleague, Justice Sopinka, while declining to
dismiss the appeal on that ground, would do so ""on the ground that the
court of appeal has a limited discretion to dismiss an appeal in such
circumstances and that this was a proper case for its exercise"" (p. 635). 
I respectfully disagree.

 

                   I share the view
expressed by Goodridge C.J. in dissent that no abuse of process occurred in the
present case.  Furthermore, I cannot agree with my colleague that s. 686(4) of
the Code confers any discretion on a court of appeal other than the
discretion to dismiss or allow an appeal.  In particular, I cannot agree, as a
matter of law, principle and policy, that a court of appeal is empowered to
inquire into prosecutorial discretion.  

 

                   Section 686(4)  of
the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

 

                   686. . . .

 

                          (4) Where an
appeal is from an acquittal, the court of appeal 

                   may

 

                   (a)
dismiss the appeal; or

 

                   (b)
allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

                          (i)
order a new trial, or

 

                   (ii)
except where the verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter
a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a
sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and
direct the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

 

                   My colleague has
summarized the facts and the judgments which relieves me of the necessity of
dealing with them at length.  Suffice it to say that, on April 20, 1989, a car
driven by the respondent was involved in an accident in which one of his
passengers died and two others were injured.  The respondent was charged with
one count of impaired driving causing death and two counts of impaired driving
causing bodily harm.  At trial, the breathalyzer evidence, which was the most
probative evidence tendered by the Crown, was found to have been obtained in
breach of the respondent's right to counsel in s. 10 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . As such, the evidence was declared
inadmissible and was excluded.  The Crown elected to call no further evidence
and the respondent was, consequently, acquitted.  The Court of Appeal, having
found no Charter  breach, held that the evidence was admissible as a
matter of law.  While such an appeal would normally be allowed and a new trial
ordered according to s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code , the Court entered a
verdict of acquittal on the basis that there had been an abuse of process by
the Crown.

  

                   At the outset, it
is important to note that the Court of Appeal was unanimous in holding that the
trial judge had erred in excluding the properly admissible breathalyzer
evidence.  This is no longer an issue before us.  As to the discretion of a
court of appeal in Crown's appeals under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code ,
the Court of Appeal was also unanimous in holding that s. 686(4)  does not oust
courts' power to sanction an abuse of process.  Beyond that, I share Goodridge
C.J.'s  affirmation for the reasons he exposes (1993), 105 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
271, at p. 305, that:

 

...
the Court of Appeal must either dismiss the appeal or allow the appeal
and set aside the verdict, and, if it allows the appeal and sets aside the
verdict, it must either order a new trial or, unless the verdict
appealed from is that of a jury, enter the verdict which should have been
entered at trial. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I will discuss the
following issues in turn:

 

1. 
The Abuse of Process;

2. 
The Discretion under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code ; 

3. 
Prosecutorial Discretion.

 

1.  Abuse of
Process

 

                   Although it is
today undisputed that courts have an inherent and residual discretion to
prevent an abuse of the court's process, this was not always the case.  For a long
period of time, authority for such a proposition was sparse and was generally
made in obiter dicta.  (See R. v. Leroux (1928), 50 C.C.C. 52
(Ont. C.A.), at pp. 56-57, per Grant J.A. for the court,  R. v. Bell
(1929), 51 C.C.C. 388 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 391-92, per Macdonald C.J.A., 
and R. v. Leclair (1956), 115 C.C.C. 297 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 302-3, per
Mackay J.A. for the court.) 

 

                   In R. v. Osborn
(1968), 4 C.C.C. 185, Jessup J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal,
relied on the majority decision of the House of Lords in Connelly v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] 2 All E.R. 401, to hold that every
court, regardless of whether it exercises civil or criminal jurisdiction, has
an inherent discretionary power to prevent an abuse of process through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings.  He cautioned, however, that such
discretion should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances
(at pp. 189-91).  On appeal before our Court (R. v. Osborn, [1971]
S.C.R. 184), three justices (Pigeon J., Martland and Judson JJ. concurring)
held that no such discretion existed, three (Hall J., Ritchie and Spence JJ.
concurring) held that it was not necessary to decide the question and the
seventh, Fauteux J. (as he then was), simply concurred in the result, which
left the state of the law in doubt.

 

                   The issue was again
raised in Rourke v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1021, where the alleged
abuse of process stemmed from a lengthy delay on the part of the police before
arresting the accused.  Pigeon J., writing for the majority, concluded at p.
1043:

 

For
the reasons I gave in The Queen v. Osborn, [1971] S.C.R. 184, I cannot
admit of any general discretionary power in courts of criminal jurisdiction to
stay proceedings regularly instituted because the prosecution is considered
oppressive.

 

The minority, per Laskin C.J.,
concurring in the result, following Connelly v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, supra, and Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Humphrys, [1976] 2 All E.R. 497 (H.L.), would have recognized that criminal
trial courts have an inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of their process,
keyed to particular situations.  Subsequent decisions of this Court have
alluded in obiter dicta to the existence of a doctrine of abuse of
process (Erven v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, at p. 957 (per
Pratte J.), R. v. Krannenburg, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053, at p. 1061 (per
Dickson J.), and Amato v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at pp. 454-55
(per Estey J.)).  In the wake of Rourke, supra, provincial
appellate courts divided on the issue.  Some applied Rourke, supra,
and held that the doctrine of abuse of process was not available in criminal
proceedings (R. v. Lebrun (1978), 7 C.R. (3d) 93 (B.C.C.A.)).  Others
applied the doctrine but restricted it to exceptional circumstances (Re Ball
and The Queen (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 532 (Ont. C.A.), Re Abarca and The
Queen (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 410 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Young
(1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.)).  R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
128, put an end to the controversy by unanimously affirming the availability of
the doctrine of abuse of process in criminal proceedings.  The Court, at pp.
136-37, borrowed the comments of Dubin J.A. in R. v. Young, supra,
that a stay of proceedings should be granted where ""compelling an accused
to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which
underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency"" or where the
proceedings are ""oppressive or vexatious"".  The Court also adopted,
at p. 137, ""the caveat added by the [Ontario] Court [of Appeal] in Young
that this is a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of
cases'"".  Dickson C.J., at pp. 132-33, reproduced in part the following
comments of Viscount Dilhorne of the House of Lords in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Humphrys, supra, at p. 509 and p. 511:

 

                   Where
an indictment has been properly preferred . . . has a judge power to
quash it and to decline to allow the trial to proceed merely because he thinks
that a prosecution of the accused for that offence should not have been
instituted?  I think there is no such general power and that to
recognise the existence of such a degree of omnipotence is, as my noble and
learned friend, Lord Edmund‑Davies, has said, unacceptable in any country
acknowledging the rule of law.  But saying this does not mean that there is not
a general power to control the procedure of a court so as to avoid unfairness. 
If at the time of Connelly it had been possible to try the murder and
robbery charges together, then it might well have been held unfair, oppressive
and an abuse of process for them to be tried separately, each charge being
based on the same evidence.  But that is very different from saying that a
judge has power to stop a prosecution for perjury just because he thinks it
should not have been brought and that it will show that the verdict at the
trial at which it is alleged the perjury was committed should have been guilty.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   If
there is the power which my noble and learned friends think there is to stop a
prosecution on indictment in limine, it is in my view a power that should only
be exercised in the most exceptional circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In R. v.
Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, the Court unanimously reaffirmed the
principle enunciated in R. v. Jewitt, supra.  While she held that
a stay of proceedings for abuse of process was not limited to cases where there
is evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, Wilson J. for the Court, at p. 659,
was careful to point out that the remedy will only be granted in the ""clearest
of cases"".  In R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, a stay of
proceedings was entered on the basis that (per Lamer J., at p. 939)
""in criminal law the doctrine of abuse of process draws on the notion that
the state is limited in the way it may deal with its citizens"".  In R.
v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, writing for the majority, I expressed the
following view, at p. 1667:

 

                   Under
the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an
appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the
charge.  The prosecution is set aside, not on the merits (see Jewitt, supra, at p.
148), but because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed
would tarnish the integrity of the court.  The doctrine is one of the safeguards
designed to ensure ""that the repression of crime through the conviction of
the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a
society"" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.)  It acknowledges that courts must have the
respect and support of the community in order that the administration of
criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the
affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest
in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of
justice is best served by staying the proceedings. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I
added, however, on the same page, that a stay of proceedings for abuse of
process will only be granted in the ""clearest of cases"".  This was
reiterated in R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, per Cory J.  See
also R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880.

 

                   I,
therefore, conclude that, in criminal cases, courts have a residual discretion
to remedy an abuse of the court's process but only in the ""clearest of
cases"", which, in my view, amounts to conduct which shocks the conscience
of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice
that it warrants judicial intervention. 

 

                   To
conclude that the situation ""is tainted to such a degree"" and that it
amounts to one of the ""clearest of cases"", as the abuse of process
has been characterized by the jurisprudence, requires overwhelming evidence
that the proceedings under scrutiny are unfair to the point that they are
contrary to the interest of justice.  As will be developed in more detail
further in these reasons, the Attorney General is a member of the executive and
as such reflects, through his or her prosecutorial function, the interest of
the community to see that justice is properly done.  The Attorney General's
role in this regard is not only to protect the public, but also to honour and express
the community's sense of justice.  Accordingly, courts should be careful before
they attempt to ""second‑guess"" the prosecutor's motives when he
or she makes a decision.  Where there is conspicuous evidence of improper
motives or of bad faith or of an act so wrong that it violates the conscience
of the community, such that it would genuinely be unfair and indecent to
proceed, then, and only then, should courts intervene to prevent an abuse of
process which could bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Cases
of this nature will be extremely rare.   

 

                   Applying
this test to the facts of this case, it is evident that in no way did the
conduct of the prosecution meet the high threshold required to constitute an
abuse of process.  There is not one iota of evidence that the Crown
prosecutor's conduct was prompted by bad faith or an improper motive, a fact
recognized by Cameron J.A., nor did the prosecution intend to frustrate the
administration of justice or even to circumvent the rules of criminal law
regarding interlocutory appeals contrary to what Marshall J.A. suggests.  I
agree with Cameron J.A. when she writes at p. 290:

 

Counsel for the respondent, in oral submission, argued
that this appeal is tantamount to an interlocutory appeal.  I do not accept
that submission.  This is not a request, before verdict, for a determination of
the correctness of a ruling so that a party may adjust the presentation of its
case in light of the decision.  Had the trial judge been upheld by this court,
the Crown would not have been able to then proceed with the trial.

 

                   Goodridge
C.J., for his part, wrote, at p. 306:

 

                   If the power to order a new trial is
discretionary, upon what basis is a new trial to be denied the Crown in a
successful appeal from acquittal.  Logically the only basis upon which a new
trial could be denied is if the ordering of a new trial would be an abuse of
process.

 

                   After
citing Wilson J. in R. v. Keyowski, supra, Goodridge C.J.
continued:

 

                   The test for granting a stay is
whether ""compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those
fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair
play and decency"".  If the court has power to deny a new trial in a case
such as this, the test should be the same.

 

                   And
further at p. 307:

 

The respondent should not be heard to complain unless
the decision made by Crown counsel was so clearly wrong as to render what would
amount to a delayed guilty verdict an abuse of process and, as earlier said,
that position is one that should be taken at trial and not on appeal.

 

                   I
agree with Goodridge C.J. that no abuse of process has been demonstrated here. 


 

                   That
the Crown prosecutor may have acted precipitously or may have exercised poor
judgment in deciding not to adduce further evidence, even if true, fails to
establish misconduct of such a nature as to shock the community's sense of
fairness or to warrant the application of the doctrine of abuse of process. 

 

                   Moreover,
Sopinka J.'s assertion that this case is a borderline case, and the test of
reasonableness which he applies, only confirm the unavailability of the
doctrine of abuse of process.  In applying that doctrine here, the majority of
the Court of Appeal was, in my view, in error.

 

                   That
being said, over and above the doctrine of abuse of process which permeates the
whole of the criminal process, does s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code 
confer a discretion on an appellate court other than that to allow or dismiss a
Crown's appeal when it concludes that there was a reversible error in the trial
court?  It is to this question that I now turn.

 

2.  The Discretion under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code 

 

                   Although
my colleague agrees with the Crown that the test set out in Vézeau v. The
Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, may not be appropriate in a Crown appeal from a
directed verdict of acquittal by reason of no evidence, he goes on to say that Vézeau,
supra, did not purport to exhaust the discretion conferred by s.
686(4) .  In his opinion, at p. 646, ""there is support in our jurisprudence
for a limited discretion on the part of the Court of Appeal to decline to allow
an appeal in some circumstances in which the Crown unreasonably shuts down its
case with the result that a verdict of acquittal is directed"".  I
respectfully disagree.

 

                   My
colleague relies on R. v. Banas and Haverkamp (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 224
(Ont. C.A.), R. v. Voykin (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 280 (Alta. C.A.), and R.
v. Bailey (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (Ont. C.A.).  As Goodridge C.J. pointed
out, at p. 304, all of those cases ""seem to have involved a situation
where new trials were ordered because the successful appeals from acquittal
occurred in cases where critical evidence had been ruled inadmissible"". 
In Bailey, supra, which purported to follow Banas, the
circumstances were such that there did not seem to be anything in the record to
indicate that the evidence ruled inadmissible was critical.  My colleague
Sopinka J. also relied on R. v. Whittle (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 49 (Ont.
C.A.).  As this case is on appeal before us, I prefer not to comment on it.  

 

                   However,
had the conduct of the Crown in those cases been such that a stay of
proceedings would have been warranted, as  Martin J.A. seems to infer in his obiter
dicta in Banas, supra, it might very well be that the Court
would have found an abuse of process.  It may well be that a Court of Appeal
might find an abuse of process in a case where the Crown refuses to continue a
trial, despite sufficient evidence to found a verdict, for the sole purpose of
obtaining an interlocutory appeal on an adverse ruling.  Such an appeal would
not be available to the accused in the parallel situation, and the accused
would be forced to undergo an unnecessary second trial.  As such, a case might
be made that the Crown's conduct constitutes an unfair and abusive exercise of
the prosecutorial discretion conferred upon it.

 

                   None
of those cases relied on by my colleague Sopinka J., in my view, supports the
proposition that s. 686(4)  provides for a limited discretion in a court of
appeal other than the general discretion of courts to control their process and
prevent its abuse. 

 

                   Furthermore,
there is no policy consideration that warrants such a broad interpretation of
s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code .  My colleague does not mention any, nor
do the parties.  Quite the contrary, an efficient administration of justice
warrants that courts not meddle in a trial within a trial, base their finding
on pure speculation and second-guess the prosecution.  

 

                   In
holding that under s. 686(4) of the Code an appellate court is entitled
to consider whether the Crown has acted unreasonably, my colleague invites the
courts of appeal to invade the exclusive domain of the Crown and to interfere
with prosecutorial discretion, as well as to foster rulings based on pure
speculation as to what might have happened had the prosecution chosen a
different path.  This, in my view, is not only impermissible and contrary to
the rule of law but also contrary to the interest in a good and efficient
administration of justice.  

 

                   For
these reasons, I am of the view that s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code  does
not confer a court of appeal any discretion, however limited, beyond the
general power to control its process in case of abuse.  I now turn to the issue
of prosecutorial discretion.  

 

3.  Prosecutorial Discretion

 

                   My
colleague himself, at p. 649, alluding to the type of discretion he sees in s.
686(4)  of the Criminal Code , warns that courts ""should be mindful
of the fact that exercising this power must be done sparingly in that it
constitutes a review of prosecutorial discretion"".  This, at a minimum,
indicates the danger with which such interference by courts is fraught.  There
are other dangers, not the least of which involves the possibility of
interfering with the separation of powers under our constitution.

 

                   In
contrast to the U.S. Constitution, no general ""separation of powers""
doctrine is spelled out in the Constitution Act, 1867 .  However, as
Professor Peter W. Hogg notes in Constitutional Law of Canada (3rd ed.
1992), at pp. 184-85, such a separation of powers does in fact exist.  As
Dickson C.J. wrote, for the Court, in Fraser v. Public Service Staff
Relations Board, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455, at pp. 469-70:  

 

There is in Canada a separation of powers among the
three branches of government -- the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary.  In broad terms, the role of the judiciary is, of course, to
interpret and apply the law; the role of the legislature is to decide upon and
enunciate policy; the role of the executive is to administer and implement that
policy.  [Emphasis added.]

 

(See
also: Sobeys Stores Ltd. v. Yeomans and Labour Standards Tribunal (N.S.),
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 238,  Beauregard v. Canada, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 56,  Douglas/Kwantlen
Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570, Patrice Garant, Droit
administratif, vol. 2 (3rd ed. 1991), and Gilles Pépin, ""La compétence
des tribunaux administratifs de décider de la constitutionnalité d'une loi,
notamment de sa compatibilité avec la Charte canadienne des droits et
libertés "", in Canadian Bar Association -- Continuing Legal Education
Seminar on Administrative Law, Administrative Law: Past Present and Future
Where We've Been (Ottawa 1989).)  It is manifest that, as a matter of
principle and policy, courts should not interfere with prosecutorial
discretion.  This appears clearly to stem from the respect of separation of
powers and the rule of law.  Under the doctrine of separation of powers, criminal
law is in the domain of the executive, as Jean-Claude Hébert explains in
""Le contrôle judiciaire de certains pouvoirs de la couronne"", in Droit
pénal - Orientations nouvelles (1987), 129, at pp. 136-37:

 

                   [translation] 
In Canada, it is the executive which assumes primary responsibility for
administering the criminal law, as was held by a majority of the Supreme
Court in Skogman v. The Queen.  This stems from the fact that there must
be an authority which decides whether the judicial process should be set in
motion and what form the prosecution will take.  Decisions concerning the
operation of criminal justice involve important considerations relating to the
public interest.  From this perspective, the actions of the Attorney
General are hybrid in that there is a perpetual moving to and fro between his
legal and political functions.  That is why the Attorney General must answer
politically to Parliament for the manner in which the Crown exercises its
powers.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Donna
C. Morgan in ""Controlling Prosecutorial Powers -- Judicial Review, Abuse
of Process and Section 7  of The Charter "" (1986-87), 29 Crim. L.Q.
15, at pp. 20‑21, probes the origins of prosecutorial powers:

 

Most [prosecutorial powers] derive...from the royal
prerogative, defined by Dicey as the residue of discretionary or arbitrary
authority residing in the hands of the Crown at any given time.  Prerogative
powers are essentially those granted by the common law to the Crown that are
not shared by the Crown's subjects.  While executive action carried out under
their aegis conforms with the rule of law, prerogative powers are subject to
the supremacy of Parliament, since they may be curtailed or abolished by
statute. 

 

                                                                   .
. .  

 

Still other powers that derive directly from the
prerogative now reside in  the Criminal Code ....  Others ... have been limited
or otherwise modified by Parliament.  Finally, another group of prosecutorial
powers ... are creatures of statute.

 

                   And
at pp. 18-19, she expands on the independence of prosecutors:

 

                   Along with the exalted status of his
office come high expectations as to the Attorney-General's performance of his
functions.  A large measure of constitutional trust is reposed within him, and
he bears a heavy obligation to conduct himself with dignity and fairness.  In
many situations, he is described as acting either judicially or quasi‑judicially. 
When exercising his ""grave"" discretion in prosecutorial matters,
he must take into account not only the position of the individual, but what the
public interest demands.  In doing so, he must stand alone, acting
independently of political or other external influences.  He is to be neither
instructed or restrained, save by his final accountability to Parliament.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
""Prosecutorial Discretion"" (1987‑88), 30 Crim. L.Q.
219,  at p. 219, David Vanek explains the meaning of prosecutorial discretion:

 

                   Prosecutorial discretion refers to
the discretion exercised by the Attorney‑General in matters within his
authority in relation to the prosecution of criminal offences.  The
Attorney‑General is the chief law officer of the Crown and a member of
the Cabinet.  He heads a ministry of the government that exercises the
authority over the administration of justice and the constitution and the
maintenance and organization of the courts that is conferred upon the
provincial government by the constitution....  [T]he Attorney-General is the
prosecutor and hence, in effect, a litigant in every criminal case except.... 
In practice, the Attorney‑General acts in individual cases through the
numerous Crown Attorneys and Assistant Crown Attorneys who are appointed as his
agents to prosecute for criminal offences on his behalf. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
""Prosecutorial Discretion: A Reply to David Vanek"" (1987‑88),
30 Crim. L.Q. 378, at pp. 378‑80, J. A. Ramsay expands on the
rationale underlying judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion:

 

                   Crown counsel in Ontario are
responsible ultimately to the Attorney‑General, who is responsible to the
Legislature....  The Ministry of the Attorney‑General exercises careful
supervision of prosecutions for which it is responsible.  Proceedings are
conducted in public and any member of the public is free to bring the conduct
of Crown counsel to the attention of the Attorney‑General.  In practice,
Crown counsel must be prepared to account for their actions on every single
case they prosecute.  

 

                                                                   .
. .  

 

It is fundamental to our system of justice that criminal
proceedings be conducted in public before an independent and impartial tribunal. 
If the court is to review the prosecutor's exercise of his discretion the
court becomes a supervising prosecutor.  It ceases to be an independent
tribunal. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   That
courts have been extremely reluctant to interfere with prosecutorial discretion
is clear from the case law.  They have been so as a matter of principle based
on the doctrine of separation of powers as well as a matter of policy founded
on the efficiency of the system of criminal justice and the fact that
prosecutorial discretion is especially ill-suited to judicial review.  

 

                   In
Re Balderstone and The Queen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 532 (Man. C.A.),
(leave to appeal refused by the Supreme Court of Canada on December 15, 1983,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. v), Monnin C.J. wrote, at p. 539:

 

                   The judicial and the executive must
not mix.  These are two separate and distinct functions.  The accusatorial
officers lay informations or in some cases prefer indictments.  Courts or the
curia listen to cases brought to their attention and decide them on their
merits or on meritorious preliminary matters.  If a judge should attempt to
review the actions or conduct of the Attorney‑General ‑‑
barring flagrant impropriety ‑‑ he could be falling into a field
which is not his and interfering with the administrative and accusatorial
function of the Attorney-General or his officers.  That a judge must not do.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   La
Forest J. stated in R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at pp. 410-11:

 

Discretion is an essential feature of the criminal
justice system.  A system that attempted to eliminate discretion would be
unworkably complex and rigid.  Police necessarily exercise discretion in
deciding when to lay charges, to arrest and to conduct incidental searches, as
prosecutors do in deciding whether or not to withdraw a charge, enter a stay,
consent to an adjournment, proceed by way of indictment or summary conviction, launch
an appeal and so on.

 

                   The Criminal Code  provides no
guidelines for the exercise of discretion in any of these areas.  The day to
day operation of law enforcement and the criminal justice system nonetheless
depends upon the exercise of that discretion.

 

                   This Court has already recognized
that the existence of prosecutorial discretion does not offend the principles
of fundamental justice; see R. v. Lyons, supra, at p. 348;
see also R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284, at pp. 303‑4. The Court
did add that if, in a particular case, it was established that a discretion was
exercised for improper or arbitrary motives, a remedy under s. 24  of the Charter 
would lie.... [Emphasis added.]

 

(See
also: United States of America v. Cotroni, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, R.
v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 348, R. v. Verrette, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
838, at p. 350, and Smythe v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 680, at p. 686.)

 

                   Our
Court in R. v. T. (V.), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749, at p. 761, commented on the
rationale for not interfering with prosecutorial discretion:

 

                   It is important to understand the rationale
for this judicial deference to the prosecutor's discretion.  In this regard,
the reasons of Viscount Dilhorne in Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Humphrys, [1976] 2 All E.R. 497 (H.L.), at p. 511, are instructive:

 

                   A judge must keep out of the arena. 
He should not have or appear to have any responsibility for the institution of
a prosecution.  The functions of prosecutors and of judges must not be blurred.
If a judge has power to decline to hear a case because he does not think it
should be brought, then it soon may be thought that the cases he allows to
proceed are cases brought with his consent or approval. (Emphasis added.)

 

                   Consider also Powell J.'s comments in
Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985).  Though the factual content
of the case at bar is fundamentally different from that with which the U.S.
Court was faced (selective prosecution of violators of a law requiring
Selective Service registration), his caution respecting the institutional
competence of the courts bears repeating.  At pages 607‑8 Powell J.
remarks:

 

This broad discretion rests largely on the recognition
that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill‑suited to judicial
review.  Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's general
deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and the case's
relationship to the Government's overall enforcement plan are not readily
susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent to undertake. 
Judicial supervision in this area, moreover, entails systemic costs of
particular concern.  Examining the basis of a prosecution delays the criminal
proceeding, threatens to chill law enforcement by subjecting the prosecutor's
motives and decision-making to outside inquiry, and may undermine prosecutorial
effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforcement policy.  All these are
substantial concerns that make the courts properly hesitant to examine the
decision whether to prosecute.  [Emphasis added, in addition to material
emphasized in original, from ""Such factors . . . to undertake.""]

 

                   Since
a myriad of factors can affect a prosecutor's decision either to bring charges,
to prosecute, to plea bargain, to appeal, etc., courts are ill-equipped to
evaluate those decisions properly.  (See: Steven Alan Reiss,
""Prosecutorial Intent in Constitutional Criminal Procedure"" (1987),
135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1365, at p. 1373.)

 

                   The
judicial review of prosecutorial discretion may also involve disclosure by the
Crown of precise details about the process by which it decides to charge, to
prosecute and to take other actions.  Such a procedure could generate masses of
documents to review and could eventually reveal the Crown's confidential
strategies and preoccupations.  For example, the confidential nature of the
charging process serves important institutional functions, including
rehabilitative goals and the goal of increasing general deterrence.  The latter
is met only by preventing the public from knowing which crimes will be given
emphasis in enforcement.  Professor Richard S. Frase (""The Decision to
File Federal Criminal Charges: A Quantitative Study of Prosecutorial
Discretion"" (1979-1980), 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 246)  points to further
elements which militate against the review of prosecutorial discretion, at p.
297:

 

... (3) publication [in a judicial review, of the
Crown's guidelines or policies] inevitably would result in more frequent
attempts to invoke judicial review of prosecution policy and decisions, and
such review would further clog an already overburdened criminal court system;
and (4) if prosecutors knew that their policy would be published, they would be
reluctant to formulate it, or to change it once it was formulated.

 

Indeed,
confidentiality permits prosecutors to employ flexible and multifaceted
enforcement policies, while disclosure promotes inflexible and static policies
which are not necessarily desirable.  

 

                   Moreover,
should judicial review of prosecutorial discretion be allowed, courts would
also be asked to consider the validity of various rationales advanced for each
and every decision, involving the analysis of policies, practices and procedure
of the Attorney General.  The court would then have to ""second-guess""
the prosecutor's judgment in a variety of cases to determine whether the
reasons advanced for the exercise of his or her judgment are a subterfuge. 
This method of judicial review is not only improper and technically
impracticable, but, as Kozinski J. observed in United States v.
Redondo-Lemos, 955 F.2d 1296 (9th Cir. 1992), at p. 1299:

 

Such decisions [to charge, to prosecute and to
plea-bargain] are normally made as a result of a careful professional
judgment as to the strength of the evidence, the availability of resources,
the visibility of the crime and the likely deterrent effect on the particular
defendant and others similarly situated.  Even were it able to collect,
understand and balance all of these factors, a court would find it nearly
impossible to lay down guidelines to be followed by prosecutors in future
cases.  We would be left with prosecutors not knowing when to prosecute and
judges not having time to judge. [Emphasis added.]

 

Such a
situation would be conducive to a very inefficient administration of justice. 
Furthermore, the Crown cannot function as a prosecutor before the court while
also serving under its general supervision.  The court, in turn, cannot both
supervise the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and act as an impartial
arbitrator of the case presented to it.  Judicial review of prosecutorial
discretion, which would enable courts to evaluate whether or not a prosecutor's
discretion was correctly exercised, would destroy the very system of justice it
was intended to protect (United States v. Redondo-Lemos, supra,
at p. 1300).

 

                   In
Director of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, supra, at
p. 511, Viscount Dilhorne provides a further reason why judicial screening
of prosecutorial discretion is not mandated:

 

                   A judge must keep out of the
arena.  He should not have or appear to have any responsibility for the
institution of a prosecution.  The functions of prosecutors and of judges must
not be blurred. If a judge has power to decline to hear a case because he does
not think it should be brought, then it soon may be thought that the cases he
allows to proceed are cases brought with his consent or approval. [Emphasis
added.]  

 

In our
system, a judge does not have the authority to tell prosecutors which crimes to
prosecute or when to prosecute them.  As well, in United States v.
Giannattasio, 979 F.2d 98 (7th Cir. 1992), the trial judge had originally
directed the prosecutor to select only five counts because the former had only
a week in which he could hear the case.  In the trial judge's view, the
government would get the same benefit from five convictions as from fifteen. 
When the case was called for trial, the prosecutor refused to proceed on the
basis of five counts and the trial judge dismissed the entire indictment. 
Writing for the Court of Appeals, Posner J. reversed the order of dismissal and
said, at p. 100:

 

If Dr. Giannattasio committed fifteen Medicare frauds, a
judge cannot tell the Justice Department to prosecute him for only five of the
frauds, or to prosecute him for five now and the rest later, if necessary.  Of
course there are judicially enforceable checks on discretion to indict.  But
they are protections for defendants, not for judges.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I
agree with Sidney I. Lezak and Maureen Leonard (""The Prosecutor's
Discretion: Out of the Closet -- Not Out of Control"" (1984), 63 Or. L.
Rev. 247, at p. 251) that:

 

                          Fifth,    law
enforcement considerations support continued       prosecutorial
discretion.  The need to obtain information about other   crimes or other
criminals, and the difficulty of proving the crime at        trial often play a
part in decisions to grant immunity or reduce charges. 

 

                   Sixth, although the pressure of
public opinion is a ""wild card"" factor which is difficult to
evaluate, aggressive news coverage or oversight of specific criminal
proceedings by special interest groups affects the exercise of discretion.  Hence,
public opinion assumes an increasingly important position in the prosecutor's
decisional matrix.  An interesting example is the change in prosecution
policies that  appeared when it became increasingly unpopular to convict draft
evaders and protesters of the Vietnam War.  [Emphasis added.]

Prosecutions Act  1983"" (1985), 59 Austl. L.J. 197, at pp. 197,
199-200 and 202.)

 

                   My
colleague's invitation to the court of appeal to interfere with prosecutorial
discretion, absent abuse of process, goes against the grain of doctrine and
jurisprudence.  It also carries with it the dangers that have been outlined
above.  In my view, there is neither a need nor a justification for an
interpretation of s. 686(4)  of the  Criminal Code  which extends the
discretion of the courts in this manner.  As Goodridge C.J. underlined, the
wording of s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code  does not warrant such an
interpretation, particularly in view of our Court's decision in Welch v. The
King, [1950] S.C.R. 412.  Principle and policy dictate against it, and the
case law does not favour it.  

 

                   For
these reasons, I conclude that courts of appeal possess no residual discretion
under s. 686(4) .

 

                   Had
I agreed with my colleague that such a discretion does exist, I still would
have come to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal should have ordered a new
trial instead of inscribing a verdict of acquittal for the following reasons.  

                   The
only evidence which the Court of Appeal could and did assess was the evidence
presented at the voir dire and at the preliminary inquiry.

 

                   On
the one hand, it is clear that the evidence led at a voir dire to
establish the admissibility of evidence relevant to issues in the case, does
not assist in the determination of the innocence or guilt of an accused.  This
evidence deals with facts that have nothing to do with the commission of the
offence; e.g. the means by which the relevant evidence was obtained.  

 

                   On
the other hand, with respect to the preliminary inquiry, the observation of de
Grandpré J. in Caccamo v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786, at pp. 809‑10,
that ""the sole purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to satisfy the
magistrate that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial and
that, therefore, the Crown has the discretion to present only that evidence
which makes out a prima facie case"", is appropriate.  Moreover, as
Judson J. emphasized in Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, at p.
412: 

 

The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is clearly defined
by the Criminal Code  -‑ to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to put the accused on trial.  It is not a trial and should not be
allowed to become a trial. We are not concerned here with the power of a trial
judge to compel production during the trial nor with the extent to which the
prosecution, in fairness to an accused person, ought to make production after
the preliminary hearing and before trial.  

 

It
should also be underlined that evidence adduced at a preliminary inquiry is
incomplete.  Indeed, a number of witnesses, who will be called to testify at
trial, are not called at the preliminary inquiry and vice versa.  In my
view, therefore, the evidence adduced at a preliminary inquiry does not
properly reflect the whole of the evidence that will be presented at trial on
the merits, nor does it give sufficient indication of the strength of the
evidence that will be presented at trial.  

                   As
such, it is highly speculative to conjecture about the verdict that could
result at trial based on the evidence presented at the preliminary inquiry and
at the voir dire.  To conclude otherwise would force the Crown to
present the whole of its case at the preliminary inquiry so that, if at trial
there is an adverse ruling excluding evidence following which the Crown decides
to present no further evidence, it will not be penalized.  The Court of Appeal
would then have access to almost all of the evidence that would have been put
to the jury at the trial and would, therefore, be able to assess the whole of
the evidence.  To enforce such a rule would lead to an unnecessary waste of
resources and time, since cases where the Crown will decide not to adduce
further evidence and to appeal, pursuant to the exclusion of evidence, are rare
and always involve the risk that the appeal will be dismissed.  Speculation
about the verdict cannot serve as the basis for review of an exercise of
prosecutorial discretion that falls short of an abuse of process.

 

                   Finally,
I would also conclude that the Court of appeal should have ordered a new trial
on the basis that the excluded evidence was crucial to the Crown's case.  As
Crown counsel has argued in his factum:

 

There was evidence of alcohol consumption other than the
results of the analysis of the Respondent's breath.  However, none of this
evidence was as compelling, as incriminating or as important as the evidence
that was improperly excluded.  The remaining evidence may have been sufficient
to raise a prima facie case but the Crown would not have been able to obtain a
conviction on those charges on the basis of the remaining evidence.

 

                   And
further:

 

The other evidence of impairment in this case consisted
almost entirely of the observations of police officers.  Their evidence in this
case, while admissible, is of no more weight than [that of] other witnesses
that testified that the Respondent's ability to drive was not impaired. 
Particularly significant is the evidence of Mr. Jeffrey Porter.  Mr.
Porter was in the vehicle at and before the accident and testified that the
Respondent seemed okay to drive.... While the police officers could
comment on the Respondent's degree of intoxication, they could not comment
on whether the Respondent's ability to drive was impaired.  This is the crucial
point in the type of charges involved in this case and this illustrates why the
evidence of Ms. Dittmar was so important for the Crown to be able to prove the
charges contained in the Indictment. [Emphasis in the original.]

 

As my
colleague Sopinka J. has stated, at p. 650, in cases of impaired driving
causing death or bodily harm:

 

... the appellant would have to demonstrate that: (i)
the respondent was operating the vehicle in question; (ii) the respondent's ability
to drive was impaired by alcohol; and (iii) the impaired driving ability
of the respondent caused the death and bodily harm which occurred. [Emphasis
added.]

 

Clearly,
the first condition would be met as there was ample evidence that the
respondent had been driving the vehicle in question.  However, to meet the next
two conditions, the appellant would have had to prove that the respondent's
ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.  Thus, it was crucial for the Crown
to be able to present its evidence on this issue, especially since it appeared
that the evidence which would be adduced at trial on this issue was going to be
contradictory.

 

                   Three
friends of the respondent, Porter, Aylward and McGrath, testified at the
preliminary hearing that the respondent had consumed between six and eight
beers in a period of approximately three to four hours which ended
approximately an hour and a half before his driving.  Two police officers,
Stanley and Tilley, both testified to the respondent's showing physical signs
of impairment, including bloodshot and watery eyes, a strong smell of alcohol,
slurred speech, and staggering.  However, defence counsel suggested on the voir
dire that the accident itself would have caused the respondent to be
""pretty damn shaken up"".  From this, we can infer that the defence
counsel was trying to suggest reasons for these physical characteristics
described by the police officers other than consumption of alcohol.  In other
words, it could be argued that the shock of the accident and the knowledge of
the death of a passenger, who was a friend, caused most of these symptoms.  

 

                   Both
of the police officers testified that they formed the opinion that the
respondent was under the influence of alcohol.  Constable Jackman believed that
the respondent was impaired while Constable Tilley was not sure if the alcohol
had affected the respondent's judgment.  Contrasted with the defence's
explanation of the respondent's conduct, the observations of the police
officers demonstrate that there could be conflicting evidence led at trial on
the issue of impairment.  Therefore, it was necessary for the Crown to present
the breathalyzer evidence combined with the expert evidence on its meaning in
order to assess whether the respondent was impaired.  This was clearly the best
and most convincing evidence even without assuming that the other evidence
would not have been contradicted.  Of course it would have been challenged.

 

                   Elizabeth
Dittmar, the declared expert in absorption and elimination of alcohol from the
blood, offered an opinion at the preliminary inquiry regarding the degree of
impairment and the effect of such impairment which did not rely on the
breathalyzer result.  Her opinion was given in answer to a hypothetical
question based on the quantity of alcohol consumed by the respondent, the time
frame, the physical descriptions given by the police officers, and the
respondent's size.  However, it appears clearly that, without the breathalyzer,
the evidence she was able to give was weak.  For instance, Dittmar was only
able to estimate that the respondent's blood alcohol level would have been
between 35 and 120 mg/100 ml of blood at the time of the accident.  However,
she stated that, when the alcohol level reaches 100 mg/100 ml, she would
conclude with certainty that the ability of a person is impaired. 
Consequently, because there was no way of knowing if the respondent's alcohol
level was under or over 100 mg/100 ml, there could be no conclusive
determination as to the respondent's ability to drive if the court only took
into account evidence of alcohol consumption other than that produced by the
breathalyzer.  

 

                   Moreover,
this evidence was far from compelling in this case because the blood alcohol
level provided by the breathalyzer evidence read 170 mg/100 ml an hour and a
half after the accident. This implied, according to the expert Dittmar, that,
at the time of the accident, the respondent's alcohol level would have been
between 185 and 210 mg/100 ml of blood.  Thus, it appears that this evidence
would have made possible a conclusive determination as to the impairment of the
respondent and its influence on his driving ability since it showed clearly his
blood alcohol level was over 100 mg/100 ml. 

 

                   From
this, one can conclude that had the Crown presented further evidence at trial,
after the trial judge had ruled the breathalyzer evidence inadmissible, the
value of the expert's evidence would have been significantly reduced and would
not necessarily have assisted the Crown in proving that the respondent's
ability to drive was in fact impaired.  Most likely, the Crown would have been
unable to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The breathalyzer evidence
was crucial to the Crown's case in that it would have allowed the Crown to
present expert evidence that would have proved without a doubt that the
respondent's ability to drive was impaired, an element which is crucial in
cases of impaired driving causing death or bodily harm.  In the present case,
this evidence could not realistically be adduced in such a convincing way by
any other means. 

 

                   Furthermore,
this evidence was of the outmost importance because it seemed that the
respondent was raising alternative causes for the accident; i.e., the wet and
slippery road conditions and the car's condition.  Indeed, Constable Harnum
testified that, at the time of the accident, ""the road conditions were
wet"".  Mr. Porter, a passenger, testified that the road was slippery and
that, just prior to the accident, the rear of the vehicle began to slide.  The
mechanic who inspected the vehicle after the accident testified that one of the
tires was bald and the left front brake was worn to the point that no lining
remained.  When the respondent's counsel suggested to the mechanic that the
accident could have resulted from a blown tire, he answered that he did not
check for that and could not say that it was not so.  Therefore, it appears
that without the breathalyzer evidence, the Crown may not have been in a position
to prove that the respondent's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol
and that the impaired driving ability of the respondent caused the death
and bodily harm which occurred.  Thus, I am of the view that this evidence was
crucial to the Crown's case.    

 

                   I
conclude, therefore, that even had I shared my colleague's view that s. 686(4) 
of the Criminal Code  confers a residual discretion to a court of appeal,
which I do not, I would hold that the facts of this case do not point to an
unreasonable decision on the part of the Crown such as to warrant the exercise
of that discretion. 

 

                   I
base my reasons, however, on the fact that a court of appeal does not have the
discretion, under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code , absent abuse of
process, to decline to allow an appeal when a reversible error of law is found
in the trial judge's decision.

 

                   In
the result, I would allow the appeal, reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and order a new trial.








 

                   The
reasons of Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ. were delivered by

                                                                     

                   SOPINKA
J. (dissenting) -- The issue in this appeal concerns the power of a court of
appeal under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , to
dismiss an appeal, notwithstanding an error at trial, on the ground that the
prosecutor in an unreasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion deliberately
refrained from calling available evidence resulting in a directed verdict of
acquittal.  I would dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court of appeal
has a limited discretion to dismiss an appeal in such circumstances and that
this was a proper case for its exercise.

Facts

 

                   On
April 20, 1989, the respondent was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  The
car which the respondent was driving contained several passengers.  One of the
passengers died following the accident and another two were injured, one of
them seriously.  The respondent was charged with one count of impaired driving
causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm.  The
respondent's trial was held before Aylward J. of the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland, Trial Division, and a jury.

 

                   The
evidence revealed that Constable Stanley, who arrived first at the scene of the
accident cautioned the respondent, advised him of his rights under s. 10  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and made a breathalyzer demand. 
Stanley had determined from other persons at the scene that the respondent was
the person driving the vehicle and noted that he smelled of alcohol and was
staggering.  Stanley then took the respondent to the police station and
delivered him into the control of Constable Tilley, who asked him if he
understood his right to contact counsel and assisted the respondent in doing
so.  In fact, a telephone book was supplied and Tilley called several lawyers
before finding one of them available.  When the respondent's counsel was
contacted, Tilley informed him that the officers had received word that one of
the passengers had died.  Tilley then turned the phone over to the respondent
so that he could have a private discussion with his counsel.  Prior to the
respondent's conversation with his lawyer, he heard the officers say that one
of the passengers had died and was told that two others were in serious
condition.

 

                   After
consulting with legal counsel, the respondent refused to provide the police
with a sample of his breath.  However, once informed that a charge for failing
to comply with a demand for a breath sample would be laid if he refused, the
respondent complied.  His counsel telephoned the station after the first sample
was given and spoke with the respondent again.  After this, a second sample was
taken.  Both samples contained 170 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.

 

                   The
respondent indicated that he was aware that one friend had died and two others
were seriously injured, that the demand for a breath sample indicated that if
he failed he would be charged with impaired driving and that if he refused to
provide the breath sample he could be charged with refusing to do so.  At
trial, the respondent's counsel objected to the admission of the breath samples
results on the ground that the police had acted in violation of ss. 10 (a)
and (b) of the Charter .  

 

                   A
voir dire on the admissibility of the breath samples and statements made
by the respondent at the police station was held and Aylward J. concluded that
the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  because
the respondent had been denied his rights under s. 10  of the Charter . 
Crown counsel requested a recess and, after 30 minutes, returned to tell the
court that it did not plan to call further evidence.  Given that, prior to the voir
dire, the Crown had called only one witness, a police officer who took
photographs of the aftermath of the accident, the trial judge charged the jury
to deliver a verdict of acquittal.  On January 29, 1991, the respondent was
acquitted.

 

                   The
appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland on the ground that
the analysis of the breath samples should have been admitted into evidence.  On
April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from acquittal.  The
majority of the Court concluded that the trial judge had erred in excluding
evidence which was unarguably important, but that the appeal should be
dismissed on the basis that the appeal had been unnecessary given that the
Crown could have called further substantial evidence at trial, but chose not
to.  Goodridge C.J., dissenting, held that the provisions of s. 686(4)  of the Criminal
Code  were mandatory and that s. 686(4)  required the court to order a new
trial if it determined that the appeal should be allowed.

 

Judgments Below

 

Supreme Court of Newfoundland (Aylward J.,
ruling on voir dire)

 

                   Aylward
J. determined that the s. 10  rights of the respondent had been violated because
he had not been made aware of the extent of the jeopardy which he faced prior
to his consultation with counsel.  He then determined that, pursuant to
s. 24(2)  of the Charter , the breath sample results should be
excluded since the Charter  violation was serious and the admission of
the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Given
that the Crown elected to call no further evidence, he directed the jury to
deliver a verdict of acquittal, and the respondent was acquitted.

 

Court of Appeal (1993), 105 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271

 

                   Marshall J.A.

 

                   Relying
on this Court's decision in R. v. Smith, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 714,
Marshall J.A. concluded that the ss. 10 (a) and (b) rights of
the respondent had not been violated since, although he had not been told of
the exact charges he faced, he was aware of the purpose of performing the
breathalyzer and the circumstances in which it was performed.  As such, he
concluded that the breath sample evidence should not have been excluded.

 

                   In
determining whether the appeal should be allowed, Marshall J.A. noted that the
appellant elected not to call further evidence after the ruling on the voir
dire, even though there was substantial other evidence relating to the
impairment of the respondent, apart from the breath samples.  In these
circumstances, he concluded that the appellant had effectively launched an
interlocutory appeal of the adverse evidentiary ruling.  Given that such an
appeal was not available to an accused in a criminal trial, he determined that
it would unfairly prejudice the respondent to allow the appeal of the appellant
and order a new trial.

 

                   Relying
on the ability of an appellate court to stay proceedings as an abuse of process
and the decisions in R. v. Banas and Haverkamp (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d)
224 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Voykin (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 280 (Alta.
C.A.),  Marshall J.A. concluded that the appeal should be dismissed.  In so
doing, he made the following findings at pp. 280-81:

 

... the additional evidence was ostensibly of sufficient
weight and substance to have sustained a conviction, if accepted by the jury,
without the breathalyzer testimony.  Accordingly, it could not have been
considered futile for the [appellant] to have continued with the trial after
the breathalyzer results had been ruled inadmissible.  In such circumstances it
is not tenable to view this appeal in its essence and nature as other than an
interlocutory motion by the [appellant] aimed at the admission of excluded
evidence.  While the breathalyzer was unarguably important evidence, it was not
the only substantial evidence to which the [appellant] had recourse.  

 

                   Cameron J.A. concurring

 

                   Cameron
J.A. also concluded that there had been no s. 10  Charter  violation
and that the breath sample evidence should therefore not have been excluded. 
While she did not agree that the appeal was interlocutory in nature because it
was (at p. 290) ""not a request, before verdict, for a determination of the
correctness of a ruling so that a party [could] adjust the presentation of its
case in light of the decision"", Cameron J.A. agreed that the appeal should
be dismissed.  

 

                   Cameron
J.A. found that, since the appellant had met the burden of demonstrating the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the error not been made by
the trial judge, s. 686(4)  required the Court of Appeal to order a new
trial unless an abuse of process could be shown.  Relying on the decisions of
this Court in R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, and R. v. Jewitt,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 128 and on Banas, supra, R. v. Bailey (1983), 4
C.C.C. (3d) 21 (Ont. C.A.), and Voykin, supra, she found that, although
no prejudice to the respondent had been demonstrated, it could be inferred from
the length of the delay and that, given the substantial other evidence
available to the appellant, the appeal had been unnecessary.  As such, she
determined that a new trial should not be ordered since the evidence which was
excluded was not essential to the Crown's case, concluding as follows at p.
292:

 

... there was other evidence available respecting the
quantity of alcohol consumed by the respondent on the day of the accident and
the observations of police officers and others of his demeanour immediately
after the accident.  While I cannot say what verdict would have been reached
had this evidence gone to the jury, I am satisfied there was sufficient
evidence, other than that excluded by the trial judge's ruling, to put the
matter to the jury.  Certainly, the [appellant] could not maintain it was futile
to continue.  I conclude it would indeed be oppressive to proceed with what
might have been an unnecessary appeal and this behaviour by the [appellant] is
sufficient in itself to give rise to abuse of process.  For that reason, though
I agree the trial judge erred in excluding the breathalyzer evidence, I would
deny the appeal.  

 

                   Goodridge C.J. dissenting

 

                   Goodridge
C.J. also concluded that the Charter  rights of the respondent had not
been violated, so that the trial judge erred in excluding the breathalyzer
evidence.  As such, he determined that the appeal should be allowed.  Having
reached this conclusion, Goodridge C.J. moved on to consider whether, pursuant
to s. 686(4) , a new trial should be ordered.

 

                   Goodridge
C.J. stated that this was not an interlocutory appeal but an appeal from an
acquittal.  He emphasized at p. 305 that, under s. 686(4) , on an appeal
from an acquittal, ""the Court of Appeal must either dismiss the appeal or
allow the appeal and set aside the verdict, and, if it allows the appeal and
sets aside the verdict, it must either order a new trial or, unless the verdict
appealed from is that of a jury, enter the verdict which should have been
entered at trial"". 

 

                   Goodridge
C.J. added at p. 306 that the only basis on which a new trial could be denied
was ""if the ordering of a new trial would be an abuse of process"". 
Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Keyowski,
[1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, and to Banas, supra, Goodridge C.J.
concluded at pp. 306-7 that:

 

                   I doubt that it is proper for a court
of appeal...to make a decision that a new trial would be an abuse of process. 
A court of appeal should order a new trial where the appeal from acquittal is
successful....  It is at the trial level that the question of abuse of process
should be first decided.  A court of appeal should not pass judgment in the
first instance on a legal question when there may be facts relating to that
question that have not been determined....  

 

                   The only prejudice to the respondent
lies in the fact that if the first trial had proceeded and resulted in a guilty
verdict, his fate would have been determined at that time.  Such a verdict, if
there is to be one, is now delayed.  The delay arises from the fact that the
respondent raised a point of law in respect of which he was ultimately
unsuccessful....  The ruling of the trial judge required [appellant] counsel to
make a discretionary decision as to whether he should proceed.  The respondent
should not be heard to complain unless the decision made by [appellant] counsel
was so clearly wrong as to render what would amount to a delayed guilty verdict
an abuse of process and...that position is one that should be taken at trial
and not on appeal.

 

Issue

 

                   Does
s. 686(4) of the Criminal Code  include a residual discretion for a
court of appeal to refuse to order a new trial in a case where there was an
error at trial which could reasonably have affected the verdict?

 

Statutory
Provision

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 686(4) :

 

                          686. . . .

 

                   (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal, the court of appeal may

 

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

 

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

                   (i) order a new trial, or

 

                          (ii) except where the verdict
is that of a court composed of a   judge and jury, enter a verdict of guilty
with respect to the                                                             offence
of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been                                                                   found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that                                                              is
warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and                                                                    direct
the trial court to impose a sentence that is warranted in                                                               law. 


 

Powers of the Court of Appeal

 

                   The
powers of the Court of Appeal in indictable offences are set out in s. 686 
of the Criminal Code .  In an appeal by the accused in respect of an
error of law at trial, a court of appeal has a discretion to dismiss the appeal
if the error did not occasion a substantial miscarriage of justice.  This
discretionary power is circumscribed by a specific definition in
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  Section 686(4)  deals with
appeals by the Crown from acquittal.  Although this subsection does not specify
the grounds upon which such an appeal may be taken, s. 676(1) (a)
provides that an appeal lies from an acquittal on any ground that involves a
question of law alone.  The combined effect of these two provisions is that in
an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal based on an error of law, the Court of
Appeal ""may"" allow the appeal.  This confers a discretion on the
court but in this case the discretion is not statutorily defined.  

 

                          In
Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at p. 291,
Martland J. discussed the legislative history of these provisions and
pointed out that an earlier version of these provisions provided that the
powers of a Court of Appeal in an appeal by the Crown were to be applied mutatis
mutandis with the powers in respect of an appeal by the accused.  In the
latter case a curative provision in the terms of the present s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
applied.  See White v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 268.  The amendment (S.C.
1953-54, c. 51) did not remove the discretion but left it undefined. 
Apparently, Parliament was content to leave it to the courts to define the
circumstances in which the discretion was to be exercised.  An appeal by the
Crown from an acquittal, in contrast with an appeal by the accused from
conviction, is a relatively unusual provision not common to all jurisdictions
with systems similar to ours.  It would, therefore, be appropriate for
Parliament to accord more discretion to the courts as to the circumstances in
which an error at trial should result in a new trial or conviction in an appeal
by the Crown.

 

                          In
Vézeau this Court decided that the exercise of the discretion to allow
an appeal by the Crown grounded on an error of law included the power, which
existed before the amendment, to refuse to allow an appeal if the error did not
occasion a substantial miscarriage of justice.  At page 291,
Martland J. adopted the approach of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.
v. Paquette (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 154, in the following paragraph:  

 

                   [Section 686(4) ] does not contain any
provision equivalent to s. 613(1)(b)(iii).  The powers of the court
under this subsection were considered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R.
v. Paquette, at p. 162.  After quoting subs. (4), the Court goes on to say:

 

                   It is to be observed that the term
""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" is not incorporated
in this subsection as it is in the situation of an appeal by an accused. 
However, in this case we think it appropriate to analogize the test, and we
would hold that the Crown has satisfied us that it cannot be said that but for
the misdirection the verdict of the jury would necessarily have been the same. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

Consequently,
notwithstanding an error of law, the Crown now has the obligation of satisfying
the Court of Appeal that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same
absent the error.  See Vézeau, at p. 292, and R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.

 

                          The
Court of Appeal has, apart from the discretion defined in Vézeau, the
power to correct an abuse of process.  Indeed, that is the power which appears
to have been the basis for the exercise of discretion by the majority of the
Court of Appeal in this case.  While the more usual exercise of this power
occurs in review of the decision of the trial judge with respect to an abuse of
process that occurred at trial, exceptionally it may be exercised by the Court
of Appeal in first instance where the abuse occurs during the appeal
proceedings.  See R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at pp. 915-16. 
In view of the conclusion that I have reached it is unnecessary for me to
consider whether the conduct of the Crown in this case amounted to an abuse of
process.

 

                   In
the argument before this Court a question was raised as to whether the Crown
could satisfy the Vézeau test in the circumstances.  If an acquittal
would necessarily have resulted had the breathalyzer evidence been admitted,
the Crown would fail to discharge its burden under that test.  The conclusion
in this regard would depend to a great extent on whether the Crown, in seeking
to establish what would have occurred absent the error, could resort to the
evidence it could but did not call.  The argument against such use is that the
Crown should not be allowed to rely on untested evidence, which it chose not to
call, in order to secure a new trial.  The response of the appellant Crown to
this submission was that in a Crown appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal
by reason of no evidence, the Vézeau test is not appropriate.  Reference
was made to R. v. Collins (1993), 79 C.C.C. 204 (Ont. C.A.), wherein
Arbour J.A. concluded that in a jury case an appeal from a directed
verdict of acquittal should generally be allowed if the trial judge erred in
withdrawing the case from the jury on the basis of no evidence.  Her reasons
illustrate the difficulty in applying the Vézeau test in these
circumstances.  Not only must the court speculate as to what would have
occurred if the case had not been withdrawn from the jury, but the Crown is
effectively deprived of a jury trial in the event that the Court of Appeal
concludes that an acquittal was inevitable.  

 

                   Without
expressing an opinion on the correctness of the opinion, that in a Collins-type
of situation, the Court of Appeal should focus on the error of the trial judge
rather than its possible effect on the ultimate verdict, it seems that there is
a distinction between a case in which the Crown calls all of its evidence, and
a case such as this in which the Crown deliberately chooses to bring about a
directed verdict by not calling available evidence.  In the latter case it can
be argued that it is wrong to focus on the error of the trial judge which
triggered the decision of the Crown because the directed verdict was not the
result of an error of the trial judge but of the decision to withhold
evidence.  While these are issues that will no doubt have to be resolved in a
proper case, I do not propose to attempt to do so here.  Not only is it
unnecessary to do so in order to resolve this case, but the issue also was
apparently not raised in the Court of Appeal and was not dealt with in the
reasons of either the majority or minority.

 

                   The
decision of this Court in Vézeau in providing a test for the exercise of
the discretion conferred by s. 686(4)  did not purport to exhaust the
definition of that discretion so as to preclude the Court, in appropriate
circumstances, from adding to or qualifying the application of that test.  To
conclude that new provisions limited the exercise of discretion to reinstatement
of the test which obtained prior to the amendment would render the amendment
meaningless.  In my opinion, there is support in our jurisprudence for a
limited discretion on the part of the Court of Appeal to decline to allow an
appeal in some circumstances in which the Crown unreasonably shuts down its
case with the result that a verdict of acquittal is directed.  The
justification for such a discretion is indicated in several appellate court
decisions.

 

                   In
Banas, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal, per
Martin J.A., concluded that tape recordings of private communications
which had been excluded at trial ought to have been admitted and agreed that
the recordings were at the heart of the Crown's case.  In allowing the Crown
appeal from the directed verdict of acquittal and ordering a new trial, Martin
J.A. concluded as follows, at p. 230:

 

                   We do not think that the Crown, in
the circumstances, is precluded from appealing the directed verdict because
Crown counsel decided not to continue with the trial which he considered would
be fruitless and which would not result in a conviction due to the erroneous
exclusion of vital evidence.  We are satisfied that if the trial Judge had not
excluded the evidence of the intercepted private communications the verdict of
the jury would not necessarily have been the same.  However we wish to point
out that if in a particular case we considered that Crown counsel had
unreasonably declined to present substantial evidence in his possession which
would support a conviction merely in order to appeal an adverse ruling on the
admissibility of evidence, we would not hesitate to hold that the Crown in
those circumstances was precluded from appealing an acquittal.  We are,
however, satisfied that this it not what occurred here.  [Emphasis added.]  

 

                   Similarly,
in Voykin, supra, in determining that business records had been
wrongfully excluded by the trial judge, resulting in the acquittal of the
accused, Hetherington J.A. for the Alberta Court of Appeal stated, at p. 281:

 

                   We agree with the statements of Mr.
Justice Martin in [Banas, supra] ... to the effect that a
Court of Appeal should not countenance an appeal by the Crown of an adverse
ruling as to the admissibility of evidence if a conviction could have been
obtained without the evidence which was excluded.  We do not accept the
contention of counsel for [the accused] ... that this issue is one for the
trial judge.  It is for a Court of Appeal to decide whether the Crown has
launched an unnecessary appeal.  [Emphasis added.]  

 

                   Furthermore,
in Bailey, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that a
trial judge had wrongfully refused to allow a Crown witness to testify on the
basis of spousal incompetence, which resulted in the Crown's decision not to
call further evidence and ultimately led to an acquittal.  The court, however, per
Morden J.A., relying on the words of Martin J.A. in Banas, supra,
concluded that the excluded evidence was not essential to the Crown's case and
dismissed the appeal stating the following, at p. 25:

 

                   In these circumstances it cannot be
said that it was the trial judge's error, alone, that might have affected the
result.  The result may also have been affected by Crown counsel's decision not
to call any evidence.  While I am prepared to assume that [the Crown witness']
evidence was important, to use a general term, there is no indication of what
part it would have played in the Crown's case and no basis for concluding that
it would have been fruitless for the Crown to have continued without it.  

 

                   Finally,
in R. v. Whittle (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 49, after the trial judge had
excluded certain inculpatory statements made by the accused, the Crown offered
no evidence and the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal.  On appeal,
the exclusion of the evidence was held to be in error.  Although there was some
evidence which could have been led by the Crown and which might have been
sufficient for a prima facie case, the court was satisfied that the test
in Vézeau had been satisfied.  Notwithstanding this conclusion, the
court went on to consider the legal consequence of the failure of the Crown to
adduce available evidence.  Goodman J.A. for the court reasoned that the
principle stated by Martin J.A. in Banas, supra, was a
qualification of Vézeau.  At pages 69-70, he states:  

 

To that principle has been added the qualification that
if the appellate court were of the opinion that Crown counsel had unreasonably
declined to present substantial evidence in his possession which would support
a conviction merely in order to appeal an adverse ruling on the
admissibility of evidence, it would be precluded from appealing an
acquittal.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

He went
on to conclude, at p. 70, that counsel had not acted unreasonably:  

 

                   I have, however, no reason to doubt
that Crown counsel sincerely believed that the evidence available to the
prosecution, absent the statements ruled to be inadmissible, did not have
sufficient probative force to constitute a prima facie case.  I am of
the further opinion, based on the submissions made to the court and the facts
available on the record, that he did not decline to adduce further evidence
merely in order to appeal the adverse ruling.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   These
cases indicate that, apart from the capacity to stay for abuse of process, an
appellate court is entitled to consider whether the Crown has acted
unreasonably in refusing to call further evidence at trial because of an
adverse evidentiary ruling and to refuse to order a new trial in such
circumstances.  As with abuse of process, this discretion must be exercised
sparingly, taking into account a number of factors.  The threshold requirement
for invocation of this discretion is that, apart from the evidence excluded,
the case of the Crown was sufficient to be put to the jury.  As such, where the
remaining evidence of the Crown meets the essential elements of the offence,
but the Crown chooses not to call that evidence, then the threshold requirement
for exercising appellate discretion to refuse to order a new trial is met. 
However, the final determination will depend upon a weighing of other factors,
including, the relative strength of the evidence not called, the relative
importance of the evidence excluded by the impugned ruling, the degree of
prejudice which further proceedings present to the accused and the reasons for
the decision of the Crown not to call further evidence.  

 

                   As
a general rule a decision to shut down the Crown's case simply to appeal an
adverse ruling will be held to be unreasonable.  On the other hand, where the
evidence which has been excluded is relatively important and the remaining
evidence, although perhaps sufficient to make out a prima facie case, is
so weak that the prosecutor concludes that continuing with the trial is a waste
of time, a decision to terminate the proceedings may be reasonable.  If any
special prejudice over and above prejudice that can be inferred from any
prolongation of criminal proceedings is proved, it will be an important factor
to be weighed by the Court of Appeal.  The court should be mindful of the fact
that exercising this power must be done sparingly in that it constitutes a
review of prosecutorial discretion.  The exercise of prosecutorial discretion
in the bona fide interests of efficient justice and not merely for
tactical advantage must be respected.  It follows from the above that the
explanation submitted by the Crown for its decision, particularly at trial,
will play an important part in the review of that decision by the Court of
Appeal.

 

Application
to the Case at Bar

 

                   While
close to the line, I would uphold the exercise of the discretion by the
Newfoundland Court of Appeal to refuse to order a new trial in the present
case.  I would not, however, do so on the ground relied on by both Marshall and
Cameron JJ.A. who concluded that the appeal should be dismissed because the
appeal was unnecessary and thereby constituted an abuse of process.  Rather, I
have concluded that an appellate court also has a discretion, albeit a limited
one, to refuse to allow an appeal from an acquittal in circumstances where the
Crown, in an unreasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, decided not to
call further evidence following an evidentiary ruling adverse to its position. 
I would apply that appellate court discretion to the facts of this case,
according to the factors which were set out above.

 

The Other Evidence

 

                   In
considering the other evidence which the appellant decided not to call, it is
necessary to identify the elements of the offence in question and to consider
whether the other evidence was sufficient to warrant putting the appellant's
case to the jury.  In reaching this determination, the test to be applied is
whether the other evidence, ""if believed by a properly charged jury acting
reasonably, would justify a conviction"":  R. v. Monteleone, [1987]
2 S.C.R. 154, at p. 161.  In this case, three charges were laid against the
respondent:  two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm contrary to s.
255(2)  of the Criminal Code  and one count of impaired driving causing
death contrary to s. 255(3) .  In order to substantiate its case, the appellant
would have to demonstrate that:  (i) the respondent was operating the vehicle
in question; (ii) the respondent's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol;
and (iii) the impaired driving ability of the respondent caused the death and
bodily harm which occurred.

 

                   With
respect to the first element of the offences, the evidence from the preliminary
hearing indicated that four individual witnesses could have identified the
respondent as the person driving the vehicle in question.  Jeffrey Porter,
Gordon Aylward and Glen McGrath were all passengers in the vehicle and
testified at the preliminary hearing that the respondent had been the person
driving the vehicle at the time of the accident.  Additionally, an eyewitness
to the accident, William Keary, also identified the respondent as the driver of
the vehicle.  As such, there would appear to have been ample other evidence
with respect to this element of the appellant's case.

 

                   With
respect to the second aspect, it was not necessary to have breathalyzer
evidence to prove that the respondent's ability to operate a motor vehicle was
impaired by alcohol, nor to show that sobriety tests had been performed so long
as observations of the respondent indicated that his behaviour represented a
""marked departure from the norm"":  R. v. Smith (1992), 73
C.C.C. (3d) 285 (Alta. C.A.), and R. v. Andres, [1982] 2 W.W.R. 249
(Sask. C.A.).  Even without the breathalyzer evidence, the Crown could have
relied on the testimony of three witnesses who had been drinking with the
respondent all afternoon and could identify the quantity of beer he had
consumed and on the observations and opinions of two police officers as to the
degree of intoxication of the respondent:  Graat v. The Queen, [1982] 2
S.C.R. 819.  Jeffrey Porter, Gordon Aylward and Glen McGrath all testified at
the preliminary hearing that the respondent had consumed approximately six or
seven bottles of beer in the three or four hour period before the accident occurred. 
Although both Porter and Aylward, who testified that they had consumed a
similar amount of alcohol during the same time period, stated their opinion
that the respondent was ""okay"" to drive, both Constables Stanley and
Tilley testified at the preliminary hearing that, in their opinion, the
bloodshot eyes, strong odour of alcohol and slurred speech of the respondent
indicated that he was intoxicated.  In fact, Constable Tilley, who performed
the breathalyzer stated that it was his opinion, based on his observations of
the respondent, that the respondent was well over the legal blood-alcohol limit
for driving a motor vehicle.  Moreover, the Crown could have introduced the
evidence of its expert, Elizabeth Dittmar, with respect to the effects on driving
ability of the quantity of alcohol consumed by a person the size of the
respondent since she was a qualified expert in the field: R. v. Dubois
(1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 90, and R. v. Kucher (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 115. 
In my opinion, the body of other evidence with respect to this aspect of the
offences was certainly not so deficient that withdrawal of the case from the
jury would have been justified.

 

                   As
to the third element of the offence, causation, it was incumbent upon the Crown
to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the impairment of the
respondent was ""at least a contributing cause of death [and injury],
outside the de minimis range"": R. v. Pinske (1988), 30 B.C.L.R.
(2d) 114 (C.A.) at p. 123, aff'd, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 979.  Of necessity, the issue
of causation requires consideration of competing theories as to the explanation
for occurrence of the accident which resulted in injury and death.  The case at
bar is no exception, since the evidence tendered at the preliminary inquiry
disclosed alternative possibilities with respect to causation: impaired driving
capacity, poor road conditions and mechanical disrepair.  However, I would
reiterate that, in order to found the basis for a conviction, it need not be
demonstrated that impairment was the sole cause, since it may well be
that, even though a combination of factors were involved, impairment was still
more than a de minimis cause of the death and injury which occurred:  Pinske,
supra.  The evidence pertaining to the quantity of alcohol consumed by the
respondent, as well as the observations and opinions of the police officers
involved in the investigation, present a substantial body of evidence relating
to impairment, which might have been augmented by the expert witness.  The
other evidence relating to the impact of poor road conditions must also be
factored into the causation equation.  Jeffrey Porter, one of the passengers in
the vehicle allegedly driven by the respondent, testified at the preliminary
hearing that, prior to impact, the rear of the vehicle began to slide and the
eyewitness, William Keary, indicated that the vehicle slid around the corner
before impact and that the road conditions were ""damp"".  Moreover,
Randolph Chafe, the mechanic who inspected the vehicle allegedly driven by the
respondent after the accident gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry that the
left rear tire of the vehicle was bald and the left brake lining worn off
completely.  While these circumstances tend to weaken the Crown's case, their
weight was for the jury to assess.  There was ample evidence to go to the jury.

 

Relative Importance of the Excluded Evidence

 

                   The
breathalyzer evidence which was excluded by the impugned ruling would, if
accepted, have tended to show that the respondent had consumed more alcohol
than the other evidence relating to consumption might have indicated.  At the
preliminary inquiry, the expert was able to state conclusively, on the basis of
the breathalyzer readings of 170 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood, that the
blood alcohol level of the respondent at the time of the accident would have
been 180 to 210 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.  Further, she indicated that
an individual's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle is definitely
impaired when the blood alcohol concentration reaches or exceeds 100 mg of
alcohol in 100 ml of blood.  When cross-examined at the preliminary hearing and
asked to assess the blood alcohol level of the respondent based upon his
weight, the amount consumed and the period over which it was consumed, according
to the version of the evidence most favourable to the respondent, the expert
could offer only a range of concentrations between 35 and 120 mg of alcohol per
100 ml of blood.  Nevertheless, the fact that the breathalyzer could have
provided stronger evidence of impairment did not render it crucial
to the appellant's case, in wake of substantial other evidence of alcohol
consumption and observations and opinions of impairment.

 

                   It
was argued by the appellant that the evidence of causative factors other than
impairment rendered the breathalyzer evidence even more essential to its case. 
I am unable to accept that submission on the basis that it does not necessarily
follow that technical evidence of a higher blood alcohol level would undercut
the significance of other factors relating to causation in this case. 
Moreover, impairment need not be the only cause of death and injury, but
a contributing factor, beyond the de minimis level:  Pinske, supra. 
Substantial other evidence of impairment was available to the appellant in this
case, evidence similar in nature to that which would have been used to support
such a case prior to development of the breathalyzer test.  In my view, the
additional evidence of impairment lent to the case by the breathalyzer would
not have had a significant effect on the role played by road conditions and
mechanical disrepair, nor was it essential to establishing the impairment of
the respondent.

 

Degree of Prejudice

 

                   As
Marshall J.A. noted, no specific evidence of prejudice to the respondent was
tendered.  It is possible, however, to infer from the two-year period in which
the appeal of the original verdict of acquittal has been in the legal system
that the respondent has probably suffered a certain degree of prejudice:  R.
v. Morin, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771.  In the circumstances, having regard to the
strength of the other factors, prejudice is not an important factor in this
case.

 

Explanation by the Crown

 

                   No explanation was offered by the Crown at trial. 
Immediately following the ruling, counsel for the Crown asked and was granted a
brief adjournment.  When he returned, the following occurred:

 

By the Court: 
Proceed.

 

JURY POLLED - ALL
PRESENT

 

By the Court:  Mr. Steeves.

 

Mr. Steeves:  My Lord, the crown will elect not to call
any further evidence based on some of your earlier remarks.  

 

The
appellant's factum does not purport to address the reason why the decision was
made although the evidence which I have reviewed is put forward, ex post
facto, as justifying the decision.

 

Conclusion

 

                   Assessing
all of the factors, I have concluded that the available evidence which the
appellant chose not to call was more than sufficient to meet the threshold
test.  The relative importance of the excluded evidence was not such that to
proceed with the trial would have been a lengthy and futile exercise and a
waste of resources.  Indeed, taking into account the absence of an explanation
by the Crown, I am convinced that the decision was largely a tactical one to
reverse the trial judge's ruling so as to enable the Crown to proceed with its
best case.

 

                   I
would dismiss the appeal.

ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Sexual offences ‑‑ Time of offence ‑‑ Reopening of

assaults occurred in 1982 ‑‑  Crown closing its case ‑‑

                   The accused was
charged with indecent assault of his niece and with having sexual intercourse
with her when she was under the age of 14.  The complainant had initially
reported that the sexual assaults occurred in 1980.  An information was drafted
and the accused was arrested.  He was informed that the incidents of which he
was being accused had occurred when he was living at the complainant's house. 
After being cautioned and given his right to counsel, he made several
inculpatory statements to the arresting officers.  Following the preliminary
inquiry, the information was amended to allege that the incidents had occurred
between January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983.  The complainant, who
was 16 at the time of the trial, testified that the accused had lived at her
parents' house for a month or two in the summer of 1982 when she was eight and
that while her parents were away for a weekend, he sexually assaulted her.  She
stated that she and her mother had gone through old photographs which had
helped them determine the relevant time frame.  Her mother testified that the
accused had lived with the family for two months in the summer of 1982, and
that he had baby‑sat her daughter during a van trip in July of that
year.  The Crown closed its case and the trial was adjourned. Prior to
adjourning, defence counsel stated in open court that he would be calling three
witnesses, including an alibi witness.  When the trial resumed the Crown
successfully applied to reopen its case and recall the complainant's mother. 
She testified that she had been mistaken and that she now realized that the
accused had stayed with the family in the summer of 1983, not the summer of
1982.  The Crown was then granted leave to amend the indictment to extend the
time frame to include 1983.  The accused testified that he had lived with the
complainant's family during the summer of 1983.  He was convicted of both
counts.  The Court of Appeal found that the Crown should not have been
permitted to reopen its case or amend the indictment.  It quashed the
convictions.  The Crown appeals to this Court only in respect of the acquittal
on the sexual intercourse charge, the amendment to the indictment having
resulted in a time frame extending beyond the repeal of the offence of indecent
assault.

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The trial judge committed a reversible error in
allowing the Crown's case to be reopened after the accused had begun to answer
the case against him by revealing that he would be calling three witnesses. 
The keystone principle in determining whether the Crown should be allowed to
reopen its case has always been whether the accused will be prejudiced in his
or her defence.  A trial judge's discretion in this regard must be exercised
judicially and with a view to ensuring that the interests of justice are
served.  Traditionally, the stage reached in a proceeding has been treated as
correlative to prejudice and injustice to the accused.  Before the Crown has
closed its case, a trial judge has considerable latitude in exercising his or
her discretion to allow the Crown to recall a witness so that his or her
earlier testimony can be corrected.  Once the Crown actually closes its case
but before the defence elects whether or not to call evidence, the test to be
applied by the trial judge is generally understood to be that reopening is to
be permitted to correct some oversight or inadvertent omission by the Crown in
the presentation of its case, provided of course that justice requires it and
there will be no prejudice to the defence.  After the Crown has closed its case
and the defence has started to answer the case against it, a court's discretion
is very restricted, and it is only in the narrowest of circumstances that the
Crown will be permitted to reopen its case.  Allowing the Crown's case to be
reopened after the defence has started to meet that case would undermine the
guiding principle against self‑incrimination.  This Court's decision in Robillard,
with its more generous approach to a trial judge's discretion over reopening,
even after the defence has closed its case, must be narrowly construed as
applying only to situations where the Crown is seeking to reopen in order to
correct a matter of form.

 

                   This is an
appropriate case in which to interfere with the trial judge's exercise of
discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case.  Not only had the defence
started to meet the Crown's case by declaring its intention to call evidence,
but the mother's fresh evidence had the effect of changing the case which the
accused had committed himself to answering.  Reopening in this case was
contrary to the interests of justice and prejudicial to the accused because it
violated, indirectly, the fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system that
an accused must not be conscripted against himself.  It is unnecessary to
consider whether the trial judge erred in allowing the amendment to the
indictment.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ. (dissenting): The reopening of the case was properly allowed
by the trial judge, as was the amendment to the indictment.  Neither of these
procedural incidents altered the case which the accused had to answer, since he
had been made aware at the time of his arrest that the relevant period during
which he was alleged to have sexually assaulted the complainant was when he was
living at her parents' house, and the accused thus could not have suffered any
prejudice of any kind.  A trial judge has wide discretion to allow the
reopening of the case and such discretion, as long as it is exercised in a
manner which does not result in injustice or prejudice to the parties, should
not be interfered with.  Although in certain circumstances it may be more
likely that prejudice will arise if the case is reopened later rather than
earlier in the trial, this Court's decision in Robillard definitely
eliminated the distinction between cases where the reopening is sought prior to
and those where it is sought after the defence has started to answer the case
against it, where no prejudice is demonstrated.  Here there was no prejudice or
denial of full answer and defence in depriving the defence of the opportunity
of relying on an irrelevant detail, the dates of the offences, by allowing the
Crown to submit fresh evidence which did not change the essential features of
the case which the defence had to meet.  The key to this flexibility is rooted
in B. (G.), where this Court recognized the difficulties of pinpointing
the exact date of sexual assaults against children and the need to accommodate
this difficulty in our criminal justice system.  In light of the context of
child sexual abuse and the difficulty that children have in determining exact dates
and times of occurrences, courts must not unduly limit and complicate the trial
judge's discretion to reopen the case with inordinate technicalities.  Here
there was no actual prejudice to the defence.  While there must be great value
placed on the right of an accused to silence and the presumption against self‑incrimination,
these rights have not been violated in this case.

 

                   Section 601  of
the Criminal Code  specifically confers on a trial judge the discretion
to permit an amendment to the indictment in the absence of prejudice and
codifies the common law rule that the date of an offence need not be proven
unless it is an essential element of the offence.  There is no vested right to
a given alibi, and the availability of a particular defence is no bar to the
application of s. 601 , which was enacted to avoid having technicalities
impair the truth‑seeking function of the courts.  The amendment sought by
the Crown here was precisely for those reasons and fell squarely within the
discretion of the trial judge, who was in the best position to assess whether
or not the accused was or could be prejudiced by the amendment.

 

                   Per La Forest and McLachlin JJ.
(dissenting):  The trial judge did not err in allowing the Crown to reopen its
case and amend the indictment.  While the later the stage at which an
application to amend an indictment is made, the greater the chance for
injustice to the accused, the discretion of the trial judge is to be exercised
in the interests of justice ‑‑ which would comprise consideration
of both the interests of the accused and those of the public, including in the
latter those of the victim.  Here the interests of the accused were not
prejudiced.  The accused knew before the reopening of the case that the
incident had taken place when he resided with his niece, and thus knew exactly
the case he had to meet from the beginning.  The difficulty of children
pinpointing the exact time of incidents which have occurred several years
before, but which they are able to define in terms of other contemporaneous
matters, should be underlined.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- This case raises
the question of whether, in circumstances where the defence has started to
answer the case against it by announcing that it will be calling evidence, it
is an appropriate exercise of a trial judge's discretion to allow the Crown's
case to be reopened in order to recall a witness so she can correct her earlier
testimony.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The respondent was
charged with indecent assault of his niece contrary to s. 149(1) (now repealed)
and with having sexual intercourse with her when she was under the age of 14
years contrary to s. 146(1) (now s. 153(1) ) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34.

 

                   The complainant was
16 years old at the time of the trial.  She testified that the respondent had
resided at her parents' home in the summer of 1982 for one or two months when
she was eight years old and that, on one occasion, while her parents were away
for a weekend with their van club, she was left alone in the care of the
respondent.  On both nights during the absence of her parents, the respondent
sexually assaulted her while she was in bed.  The complainant further testified
that about one week before the ""van club weekend"", the respondent had
sexually assaulted her while her mother was asleep.  She described the last
assault as having taken place a few months later, when the respondent was no
longer staying at her parents' house and her aunt came to baby-sit.

 

                   The complainant,
who first spoke of these sexual assaults in 1989 when she was 15 years old,
initially reported that the sexual assaults had occurred in 1980.  An
information was drafted and the respondent was arrested on August 11, 1989. 
After being cautioned and given his right to counsel, the respondent made
several inculpatory statements to the arresting officers.  At the time of his
arrest, the respondent was informed by the police that the incidents of which
he was being accused had occurred when he was living at the complainant's
house.

 

                   The information
sworn on the day of the respondent's arrest described the period of the alleged
assaults as being between January 1, 1980 and January 1, 1981.  However, after
the preliminary inquiry, the information was amended, on consent, to allege
that the incidents had occurred between January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983. 
At trial, the complainant testified that all the incidents had occurred in
1982, stating that she and her mother had gone through old photographs which
had helped them determine the relevant time frame.  The complainant's mother
was also called by the Crown and she testified that the respondent had lived
with the family for two months in the summer of 1982, and that the respondent
had baby-sat her daughter during a van trip to Rochester, New York, in July of
1982.    

 

                   The Crown closed
its case and the trial was adjourned to accommodate the defence, which had not
received disclosure of oral inculpatory statements made by the respondent to
the police.  Prior to adjourning, defence counsel stated in open court that he
would be calling three witnesses, including an alibi witness, and the Crown
indicated the defence's undertaking to provide him with the particulars of the
alibi evidence.

 

                   When the trial
resumed approximately five weeks later, the Crown applied to reopen its case
and recall the complainant's mother with respect to new evidence pertaining to
the dates of the offences.  Over the defence's objection, he was permitted to
do so.  The mother testified that she had been mistaken as to the year in which
the respondent stayed with the family, and that she now realized the proper
time frame was the summer of 1983, not the summer of 1982.  The alibi evidence
was to have been that the respondent had been confined to a hospital during the
relevant time period in the summer of 1982.  

 

                   The Crown then
moved to have the indictment amended to extend the period during which the
sexual assaults were alleged to have occurred to include the year 1983.  Over
the defence's objection, leave to amend was granted and the time frame
described in the indictment became January 1, 1982 to January 1, 1984.  After a
further adjournment, the respondent was called and he testified that he had
lived with the complainant's family during the summer of 1983.  

 

                   The respondent was
found guilty of indecent assault and of having sexual intercourse with his
niece when she was under the age of 14.  The Court of Appeal, however, allowed
the respondent's appeal, quashed the convictions and entered an acquittal:
(1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 424, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 121, 13 C.R. (4th) 302, 54 O.A.C. 62. 
The Crown appeals to this Court only in respect of the acquittal entered on
count two (the charge of sexual intercourse contrary to s. 146(1)), and not
with respect to count one (the charge of indecent assault contrary to s.
149(1)).  This is because the amendment to the indictment resulted in a time
frame which extended beyond the point when s. 149(1) was still in force.

 

II.  Judicial History

 

Ontario Court, General Division  (DiSalle J.)

 

                   After hearing
argument from both sides, the trial judge allowed the Crown to reopen its case
in order to recall the complainant's mother with respect to new evidence
pertaining to the dates in the indictment.

 

                   With respect to the
Crown's subsequent application for amending the indictment, the trial judge
relied on the principles established in R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R.
30, and stated that ""there is always difficulty of pinpointing the exact
date because of the age of these complainants in trying to remember the
time"", and that

 

. .
. the incidences are not changed, we are talking here of people trying to
recall a certain date by certain events and the young complainant related it to
the van trip.  Somebody has made a mistake in the summer of the van trip.  I do
not believe that this will prejudice the accused in amending that date.

 

In finding the respondent guilty of
the offences charged, the trial judge concluded that: 

 

Although
the evidence of the complainant was confusing as to the actual dates, I find
that her evidence related to the time and place that the accused lived there. .
. .

 

I
accept the complainant's evidence as to the time and place and I accept Mrs.
P.'s evidence as to the time and place and her method of recalling it as she
thought about it and found pictures and related to that time period.

 

I
further accept Constable Rollin's evidence that she related to the accused that
the alleged offences took place at 26 Bay Road and during the time the accused
lived there.

 

Court of Appeal for Ontario (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 424 (Finlayson
J.A. for the court)

 

                   Although the appeal
before the Court of Appeal concerned only the trial judge's ruling permitting
the Crown to amend the indictment, Finlayson J.A. also considered the propriety
of allowing the Crown to reopen its case in the circumstances.  He observed
that it was only in view of the evidence of alibi that it became necessary for
the Crown to reopen its case so that it could adduce fresh evidence which made
the alibi irrelevant.  He held that the Crown should not have been permitted to
reopen its case.  The trial judge should have heard the alibi evidence and
decided the case as the Crown had defined it.  Finlayson J.A. explained (at pp.
431-32):

 

                   I
do not wish to place this opinion on too narrow a basis.  My objections are to
the reopening of the Crown's case and to the amendment of the indictment.  My
reasons in both cases relate to prejudice.  I do not see how the Crown can be
permitted to recast its case when faced with an alibi, the accuracy of which it
was not prepared to dispute.  The defence went into a trial where the Crown had
originally alleged offences in the year 1980.  The year was changed to 1982. 
The [respondent's] defence was a denial bolstered by an alibi which the defence
could establish independently of the [respondent's] evidence.  Consequently,
once the time frame was changed to include the year 1983, an adjournment could
not have assisted the [respondent].  He had lost the ability to put forward an
independent assertion of his innocence to the charge as contained in the
indictment.  In charges of sexual assault against very young children, the
accused is often reduced to his own denial as a defence.  The loss of an
independent alibi is, therefore, a very serious loss indeed. 

 

                   On the amendment
issue, Finlayson J.A. noted that prejudice to the accused is provided for in s.
529(4) (now s. 601(4)) of the Criminal Code .  He stated that in B.
(G.), supra, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that the
availability of an alibi is a significant consideration in assessing prejudice
to an accused.  He relied on the conclusion in B. (G.) (at p. 53) that,
"" [i]f the time of the offence cannot be determined and time is an
essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence, a conviction cannot
be sustained"", to find the year in which the offences were alleged to have
occurred as being crucial to the defence.  He stated (at p. 433) that
""[t]he defence was positioned to respond to the case as pleaded and led by
the Crown.  Accordingly, in my opinion, the prejudice to the [respondent]
arising from the amendment to the indictment was total, and the learned trial
judge was in error in granting the amendment"".

 

                   Finlayson J.A was
of the view that the respondent was denied a significant procedural safeguard
in that the case against him was materially changed to an altogether different
case after he had announced his defence and the Crown had closed its case.  He
suggested that amendments during a trial should not be encouraged because they
usually work to the prejudice of the accused.  He concluded that the conviction
could not stand, and accordingly allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and
entered an acquittal.

the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in concluding that the trial judge had

IV.  Analysis

 

Introduction

 

                   This case is,
fundamentally, about the reopening of the Crown's case and not about the
amendment to the indictment.  I am not convinced that the respondent suffered
any irreparable prejudice by the mere fact of the amendment to the dates
specified in the indictment.  However, the respondent was prejudiced by the
trial judge's decision to allow the Crown's case to be reopened after the
respondent had begun to answer the case against him by revealing that he would be
calling three witnesses.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the trial judge
committed a reversible error at the reopening stage, before the Crown moved to
amend the indictment.

 

                   The reason it was
not the amendment in itself but the reopening which created the injustice is
that, on the facts as found by the trial judge, the respondent knew what was
alleged against him from the outset.  He had been made aware at the time of his
arrest that the relevant period during which he was alleged to have sexually assaulted
the complainant was when he was living at her parents' house.  I am inclined to
think that, up until the point when the Crown closed its case, the dates in the
indictment could have been amended so as to make them conform with the period
during which the respondent was living with the complainant's family.  In this
regard, I would simply note that courts, including this one, have accepted
that, in cases involving offences and particularly sexual offences against
young children, absolute precision with respect to the timing of an alleged
offence will often be unrealistic and unnecessary:  B. (G.), supra,
at p. 53; also see R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at pp. 132-34,
and Re Regina and R.I.C. (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 399 (Ont. C.A.), at p.
403.

 

                   The fact that an
accused may have an alibi for the period (or part of the period) described in
an indictment does not necessarily or automatically ""freeze"" the
dates specified in that indictment.  That is to say, there is no vested right
to a given alibi.  Alibi evidence must respond to the case as presented by the
Crown, and not the other way around.  Section 601(4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 529(4) ), directs a trial judge to consider
certain factors in deciding whether to allow an indictment to be amended,
including whether an accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether an
injustice might result.  It reads as follows:

 

                   601.   . . .

 

                   (4) 
The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made to
the indictment or a count thereof under subsection (3), consider

 

(a)
the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry;

 

(b)
the evidence taken on the trial, if any;

 

(c)
the circumstances of the case;

 

(d)
whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by any
variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3); and

 

(e)
whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.

 

Nowhere does s. 601(4)  say that
inability to rely on a particular defence is co-extensive with irreparable
""prejudice"" or ""injustice"", and nor can this be inferred
from the language of the provision.  Rather, such matters are properly left to
the trial judge to consider in the particular circumstances of a case.

 

                   In any event, this
appeal can be disposed of on the basis that the reopening of the Crown's case
was in error, without considering the issue of amendment.  At the point when
the Crown moved to reopen its case, there was no basis in the evidence for the
Crown to apply for an amendment.  The indictment conformed with the evidence
which, up to that point, had been that the alleged sexual assaults had occurred
in July of 1982.  The reopening of the Crown's case to recall the complainant's
mother and have her correct her earlier testimony as to dates was, therefore, a
condition precedent to the amendment which the Crown subsequently sought.  I have
concluded that, given the advanced stage reached in the proceedings, the Crown
should not have been allowed to reopen its case in order to justify the
subsequent amendment to the indictment. 

 

The Principles Governing Reopening 

 

                   The keystone
principle in determining whether the Crown should be allowed to reopen its case
has always been whether the accused will suffer prejudice in the legal sense --
that is, will be prejudiced in his or her defence.  A trial judge's exercise of
discretion to permit the Crown's case to be reopened must be exercised
judicially and should be based on ensuring that the interests of justice are
served.

 

                   Traditionally,
courts in Canada and in England have treated the stage reached in a proceeding
as correlative to prejudice and injustice to the accused.  That is, a court's
discretion with respect to reopening will be exercised less readily as the
trial proceeds.  The point is illustrated by taking the following three stages
in a trial:

 

(1)before
the Crown closes its case,

 

(2)immediately
after the Crown closes its case but before the defence elects whether or not to
call evidence (most commonly, this is where the defence has moved for a
directed verdict of acquittal for failure by the Crown to prove some essential
ingredient of its case), and

 

(3) 
after the defence has started to answer the case against it by disclosing
whether or not it will be calling evidence.

 

                   In the first phase,
before the Crown has closed its case, a trial judge has considerable latitude
in exercising his or her discretion to allow the Crown to recall a witness so
that his or her earlier testimony can be corrected.  Any prejudice to the
accused can generally be cured at this early stage by an adjournment,
cross-examination of the recalled witness and other Crown witnesses and/or a
review by the trial judge of the record in order to determine whether certain
portions should be struck.

 

                   Once the Crown
actually closes its case and the second phase in the proceeding is reached, the
trial judge's discretion to allow a reopening will narrow and the corresponding
burden on the Crown to satisfy the court that there are no unfair consequences
will heighten.  The test to be applied by the trial judge is generally
understood to be that reopening is to be permitted to correct some oversight or
inadvertent omission by the Crown in the presentation of its case, provided of
course that justice requires it and there will be no prejudice to the defence.

 

                   Lastly, in the
third phase after the Crown has closed its case and the defence has started to
answer the case against it (or, as in much of the case law, the defence has
actually closed its case), a court's discretion is very restricted and is far
less likely to be exercised in favour of the Crown.  It will only be in the
narrowest of circumstances that the Crown will be permitted to reopen its
case.  Traditionally, an ex improviso limitation was said to apply to
this stage of the proceeding;  that is, the Crown was only allowed to reopen if
some matter arose which no human ingenuity could have foreseen.  At this late
stage, the question of what ""justice"" requires will be directed much
more to protecting the interests of the accused than to serving the often wider
societal interests represented by the Crown, the latter being a more pressing
consideration at the first and, to a lesser extent, the second phase.

 

                   The classic
Canadian authority which drew this temporal distinction in the principles which
were to govern reopening was R. v. Kishen Singh (1941), 76 C.C.C. 248
(B.C.C.A.).  There, the Crown inadvertently omitted to prove a proclamation
bringing into force the statute constituting the offence.  At the close of the
Crown's case, the defence moved for a directed verdict.  The trial judge
dismissed the motion and allowed the Crown to reopen its case to allow the
proclamation to be proved.  No evidence was called by the defence and the jury
found the accused guilty.

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal in Kishen Singh refused to interfere with the trial
judge's exercise of discretion and dismissed the appeal on the ground that the
accused had suffered no prejudice.  Macdonald C.J.B.C., however, insisted that
the decision should be confined to the facts before the court, noting that the
case did not deal with an application to reopen after the conclusion of the
whole case or after the defence was closed.  In his concurring judgment, Sloan
J.A. explained at p. 251:

 

That
discretion [to reopen] when exercised before the accused has entered upon his
defence is subject to the limitation that its exercise must be in the interests
of justice and the accused be not prejudiced thereby.  When at a later stage of
the case, that is to say, after the defence has given its evidence, then as was
held by this Court in R. v. Marsh, [1941] 1 D.L.R. 431 . . .,
following R. v. Day (1940), 27 Cr. App. R. 168, the discretion
ought not to be exercised except in a case where some matter arises ex
improviso which no human ingenuity could have foreseen.

 

While the strict ex improviso
limitation imposed on reopening after the defence had closed its case may, as
such, no longer apply (see Robillard v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 728),
I view it to be self-evident that a court's discretion to permit the Crown's
case to be reopened where an accused has started to meet the case against him
or her must be severely curtailed.

 

                   While I do not
propose to provide an exhaustive review of the jurisprudence in the area, I
believe that the authorities on reopening show clearly that courts have always
attached great significance to the stage reached in the proceeding, drawing a
particularly sharp distinction between the point at which the Crown has closed
its case and the defence has simply moved for a directed verdict (the second
phase described above), and the point at which the defence has closed its case
(the third phase).  A few examples serve to illustrate this point.

 

                   In R. v. Cachia
(1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 173 (Ont. H.C.), the accused was charged with resisting
a peace officer on July 24.  In giving their evidence in chief, the Crown
witnesses related the incident to July 23.  After the Crown closed its case,
the defence moved for dismissal.  The trial judge allowed the Crown witnesses
to be recalled and to correct their error as to the date.  The accused was
convicted.  In dismissing the appeal, Grant J. applied the rule that, when the
Crown at the conclusion of its case has inadvertently failed to prove a
necessary ingredient of the offence charged, a court has the discretion, so
long as justice requires it, to permit the case to be reopened to enable the
Crown to supply the necessary proof.  In obiter, however, Grant J. twice
underlined the fact that his conclusion would be different if the defence had
elected to call no evidence, closed its case and then moved for a dismissal of
the charge (at p. 175). 

 

                   The significance of
the caveat in Cachia becomes clearer when one considers R. v.
Dunn, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 424 (B.C.S.C.), which also involved a mistake as to
dates.  In that case, the information alleged that the offence of failing to
remain at the scene of an accident had occurred ""on or about the 16th day
of March"".  However, the Crown asked two of its witnesses to relay
what had happened on the ""16th of May"", and the witnesses, not
noticing the Crown's mistake, related the events of March 16.  After the Crown
closed its case, the accused elected not to call any evidence and moved for a
dismissal of the charge on the ground of insufficient evidence to support a
conviction for the offence alleged.  The magistrate, however, granted leave to
the Crown to reopen its case and recall the two witnesses (both of whom had
been in the courtroom and heard the argument as to dates) to correct the
mistake.  The defendant was convicted.  In quashing the conviction on the basis
that the magistrate had erred in law in permitting the Crown to reopen, Munroe
J. stated (at pp. 425-26):

 

 

It
is settled law . . . that a Court has a discretion -- which must be exercised
judicially -- to allow the Crown to reopen its case in appropriate
circumstances and that such discretion ought to be exercised in favour of the
Crown where, through inadvertence, the Crown has failed to prove an essential
ingredient of the crime charged, provided that justice requires it and that
there will be no prejudice to the defence . . ., but no authority was cited
to me, and I know of none, which supports the proposition that after the Crown
has called evidence to prove that the crime alleged in the information occurred
on a certain date, it should be allowed, after the defence has closed its case
and made a submission, to reopen its case for the purpose of recalling a
witness to change his testimony upon a vital point. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Notwithstanding the
importance which has historically attached to the stage reached in the trial
proceeding and the fact that a court's discretion to permit the Crown's case to
be reopened is highly restricted once the defence starts to answer the case
against it, it is true that the strict ex improviso rule is no longer
applied in Canada.  However, the circumstances in which the Crown may be
allowed to reopen at this stage are very narrow.  The two most common examples
are where

 

(1)the
conduct of the defence has either directly or indirectly contributed to the
Crown's failure to adduce certain evidence before closing its case:  R. v.
Champagne, [1970] 2 C.C.C. 273 (B.C.C.A.); Crawford v. The Queen
(1984), 43 C.R. (3d) 80 (Ont. Co. Ct.); and

 

(2)the
Crown's omission or mistake was over a non-controversial issue to do with
purely formal procedural or technical matters, having nothing to do with the
substance or merits of a case:  Kissick v. The King, [1952] 1 S.C.R.
343; Robillard, supra; Champagne, supra; R. v.
Huluszkiw (1962), 37 C.R. 386 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Assu (1981), 64
C.C.C. (2d) 94 (B.C.C.A.). 

 

While I do not propose to review each
one of the cases cited in support of the above two propositions, a few of the
cases are worth considering.

 

                   For instance, R.
v. Huluszkiw, supra, is helpful in illustrating the distinction
between a matter of form and substance.  There, the accused was charged with a
prostitution-related offence for which the Criminal Code  imposed a
corroboration requirement.  A witness gave corroborating evidence at the
preliminary inquiry, but died before the trial.  The Crown, which sought to
adduce at the trial the depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry, neglected
to prove that the evidence of the deceased witness had been taken in the
presence of the accused.  The Crown's application to reopen its case was
dismissed by the trial judge on the basis that the defence had closed its
case.  The Court of Appeal, however, reversed the trial judge's ruling and
allowed the Crown to reopen its case before it in order to adduce the necessary
evidence.  McLennan J.A. justified the court's decision on the ground that (at
p. 390):

 

                   It
would be unfortunate if the ends of justice were defeated by the inadvertence
of counsel in failing to prove what is essentially a matter of form in
relation to procedure and provided always that the calling of further
evidence, whatever its character, is for an honest purpose and that there are
no unfair consequences to the opposite party so far as the presentation of that
case is concerned. [Emphasis added.]

 

He distinguished the case before him
from that of R. v. Day (1940), 27 Cr. App. R. 168, where the English
Court of Appeal found the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown in a
forgery case to call evidence of handwriting experts after the defence had
closed its case.  McLennan J.A. observed at pp. 389-90 that, in Day, the
evidence ""went to the very justice of the case"": 

 

. .
. the defence might have been presented in a different manner by calling more
witnesses or fewer witnesses than were actually called or none at all, had the
evidence given after the defence had closed its case been put in, as it ought
to have been, as part of the Crown's case in chief. 

 

McLennan J.A. concluded that the defence
was not and could not be prejudiced by allowing the Crown to reopen its case to
provide the formal proof that the accused was indeed present at the preliminary
inquiry when the deceased witness testified. 

 

                   In Robillard,
supra, a decision by this Court, there was a similar absence of formal
proof in the Crown's case.  An accomplice to an armed robbery identified the
accused at the preliminary inquiry as one of the robbers, but refused to
testify at trial.  After being permitted to read to the jury the evidence
previously given by the accomplice, the Crown closed its case.  The defence
then declared that it had no witnesses to offer and, after the Crown had
addressed the jury, argued that the accused had not been properly identified at
the trial as the same person referred to in the accomplice's testimony.  The
trial judge's decision to allow the Crown to reopen its case at this late stage
was upheld by a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal.

 

                   In dismissing the
appeal, Pigeon J. rejected for this Court the strict ex improviso rule
that had previously been applied in cases where the Crown applied to reopen
after the defence closed its case.  He suggested that a trial judge has a wide
discretion to allow a reopening in order to rectify an inadvertent omission,
and that an appeal court should only interfere in a trial judge's exercise of
discretion if it is shown that an injustice has resulted or there was some
prejudice to the accused.

 

                   In my opinion, Robillard
should be limited to its facts.  That is, I do not view Robillard as
having eliminated, in all cases, the traditional and sound distinction made by
courts between the broad discretion which exists before and immediately after
the Crown closes its case and the very narrow discretion available after the
defence begins to answer the case against it.  Rather, Robillard should
be construed narrowly, as a case dealing with a mistake as to form rather than
substance.  Given the underlying reasons for making this differentiation based
on the phase reached in a trial, which I believe are grounded in the principle
that an accused must not be conscripted against him- or herself, the temporal
distinction is an important one which must be retained.

 

The Rationale Behind Limiting
Reopening of the Crown's Case Once the Defence Starts to ""Meet the
Case"" Against It

 

                   While courts have
often been at pains to distinguish between the reopening principles which
should govern a trial judge's exercise of discretion in earlier versus later
phases of a trial, clearly viewing reopening after the defence has made an
election and/or closed its case as more prone to creating injustice than
reopening at the earlier directed verdict stage, few have been explicit about
the reasons for the difference.

 

                   The closest a court
seems to have come to providing a justification for the distinction is in the
English Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Pilcher (1974), 60 Cr. App. R.
1.  The Crown in that case applied for leave to reopen not at the close of the
defence's case but midway through it (a situation more closely analogous to the
one in the case at bar).  The Crown wished to call an additional witness who
had been available to the prosecution from the outset, but whose importance had
been overlooked in a long and complicated case.  The Lord Chief Justice held
that the trial judge had erred in allowing the Crown to reopen its case.  He
stated at pp. 5-6:

 

The
rule that the prosecution must finish their case once and for all before the
defence starts is a very important and salutary rule.  It means that the
defence does not have to meet the case until it has seen the whole case. .
. .  We do not say that in cases like the present where the matter has not
arisen ex improviso the judge had no kind of discretion at all, but we
are firmly of [the] opinion that in cases where the matter does not arise ex
improviso the judge's discretion should not be exercised to allow the late
introduction of an additional witness called for the prosecution whose evidence
was available before the case for the prosecution closed.  One must have
sympathy with overworked prosecution solicitors in long cases of this kind, but
it seems to me in the interests of finality and in the interests of fairness
to the defence one must take a strict line not to let in prosecution evidence
coming in late in the proceedings if it is outside the ex improviso rule.
[Emphasis added.] 

 

What I propose to do in this section
is elaborate on the points touched on in this passage by the Lord Chief Justice.

 

                   Perhaps the single
most important organizing principle in criminal law is the right of an accused
not to be forced into assisting in his or her own prosecution: M. Hor,
""The Privilege against Self-Incrimination and Fairness to the
Accused"", [1993] Singapore J. Legal Stud. 35, at p. 35; P. K.
McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence (3rd ed. 1988), at para.
1:10100.  This means, in effect, that an accused is under no obligation to
respond until the state has succeeded in making out a prima facie case
against him or her.  In other words, until the Crown establishes that there is
a ""case to meet"", an accused is not compellable in a general sense
(as opposed to the narrow, testimonial sense) and need not answer the
allegations against him or her.

 

                   The broad
protection afforded to accused persons is perhaps best described in terms of
the overarching principle against self-incrimination, which is firmly rooted in
the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  As a majority of this Court suggested in Dubois
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, the presumption of innocence and the
power imbalance between the state and the individual are at the root of this
principle and the procedural and evidentiary protections to which it gives
rise.

 

                   Before trial, the
criminal law seeks to protect an accused from being conscripted against him- or
herself by the confession rule, the right to remain silent in the face of state
interrogation into suspected criminal conduct, and the absence of a duty of
disclosure on the defence: R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.  With
respect to disclosure, the defence in Canada is under no legal obligation to
cooperate with or assist the Crown by announcing any special defence, such as
an alibi, or by producing documentary or physical evidence.  In obiter,
this Court suggested in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p.
333, that

 

The
suggestion that the duty [of disclosure] should be reciprocal may deserve
consideration by this Court in the future but is not a valid reason for
absolving the Crown of its duty.  The contrary contention fails to take account
of the fundamental difference in the respective roles of the prosecution and
the defence. . . .

 

                   I
would add that the fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of
counsel for the Crown are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a
conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is
done.  In contrast, the defence has no obligation to assist the prosecution
and is entitled to assume a purely adversarial role toward the prosecution. 
The absence of a duty to disclose can, therefore, be justified as being
consistent with this role. [Emphasis added.]

 

However, it should be borne in mind
that this protection against disclosure is not an absolute one.  For example,
failure to disclose an alibi defence in a timely manner may affect the weight
given to the defence: E. G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in
Canada (2nd ed. 1987), at para. 16:8070; McWilliams, Canadian Criminal
Evidence, supra, at paras. 28:10711-10712.

 

                   At trial, accused
persons continue to be protected by a right to silence.  Specifically, they
cannot be compelled to testify, and they have a right not to have their
testimony used against them in future proceedings.  These protections against
testimonial compulsion of the accused have been constitutionalized in s. 11 (c)
(right of the accused not to be compelled to testify) and s. 13  (right of
witness not to have his or her testimony from one proceeding used to
incriminate him or her in a subsequent proceeding) of the Charter .  As
this Court observed in Dubois, supra, at p. 357, when combined
with s. 11 (d) (presumption of innocence), ss. 11 (c) and 13  of the
Charter  protect the basic tenet of justice that the Crown must establish
a ""case to meet"" before there can be any expectation that the accused
should respond.

 

                   All of these
protections, which emanate from the broad principle against self-incrimination,
recognize that it is up to the state, with its greater resources, to
investigate and prove its own case, and that the individual should not be
conscripted into helping the state fulfil this task.  Once, however, the Crown
discharges its obligation to present a prima facie case, such that it
cannot be non-suited by a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, the
accused can legitimately be expected to respond, whether by testifying him or
herself or calling other evidence, and failure to do so may serve as the
basis for drawing adverse inferences:  Dubois, supra, at pp.
357-58; D. M. Paciocco, Charter Principles and Proof in Criminal Cases
(1987), at p. 495.  In other words, once there is a ""case to meet""
which, if believed, would result in conviction, the accused can no longer
remain a passive participant in the prosecutorial process and becomes -- in a
broad sense -- compellable.  That is, the accused must answer the case against
him or her, or face the possibility of conviction.

 

                   What is so
objectionable about allowing the Crown's case to be reopened after the
defence has started to meet that case is that it jeopardizes, indirectly, the
principle that an accused not be conscripted against him- or herself.  In Dubois,
this Court interpreted the privilege against self-incrimination contained in s.
13  of the Charter  as preventing the Crown from indirectly conscripting
the accused to defeat himself by using his previous testimony against him --
something which the Crown is directly prohibited from doing under s. 11 (c)
of the Charter .  In my opinion, a similar danger is involved when the
Crown seeks to reopen its case after the defence has begun to answer the
case against it -- that is, there is a real risk that the Crown will, based on
what it has heard from the defence once it is compelled to ""meet the
case"" against it, seek to fill in gaps or correct mistakes in the case
which it had on closing and to which the defence has started to respond.  To
ensure that this does not in fact happen, the Crown should not, as a general
rule, be permitted to reopen once the defence has started to answer the Crown's
case.

 

                   In other words, I
agree with respondent's counsel in this case that there comes a point when
""enough is enough"", and a mistake or omission by the Crown must
necessarily become fatal.  Once the defence starts to ""meet the
case"", thus revealing its own case, the Crown should, except in the
narrowest of circumstances, be ""locked into"" the case which, upon
closing, it has said the defence must answer.  The Crown must not be allowed in
any way to change that case.  To hold otherwise would be to undermine
the guiding principle against self-incrimination.

 

                   It is for this very
important reason that Robillard, supra, with its more generous
approach to a trial judge's discretion over reopening, even after the defence
has closed its case, must be narrowly construed as applying only to situations
where the Crown is seeking to reopen in order to correct a matter of form, and
not generally to all situations where the defence has started to answer the
case against it.  Importantly, the Crown in Robillard was merely seeking
to introduce non-controversial evidence which it would reasonably have been
expected to introduce in order to support its case, but which it had
omitted as a result of inadvertence.  It was not attempting in any way to change
the case which it had upon closing.  I would also note that Robillard
was decided in a pre-Charter  era.  With the entrenchment of the
principle against self-incrimination in the Charter , it becomes
necessary to ensure that the rules governing reopening are consistent with
constitutional imperatives.  Accordingly, any departure from the basic
principle that the Crown not be allowed to reopen once an accused starts to
reveal his or her defence must be assessed keeping that in mind.

 

                   I have suggested
that it will only be in special circumstances that a trial judge should
entertain an application by the Crown to reopen after the defence has begun
answering the case against it.  Two examples of such circumstances have been
provided:  where conduct of the defence has contributed to an omission by the
Crown, or where matters of form rather than substance are involved.  There may
be other exceptional circumstances in which reopening will be justified.  In R.
v. Nelson, [1993] O.J. No. 1899 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), a case involving a
charge of second degree murder, the Crown applied to reopen its case in order
to have evidence by the only eyewitness to the murder given by commission.  The
Crown brought its application after the trial had been completed and at the
point where the trial judge had reached a decision, but had not yet released
his judgment.  In dismissing the Crown's application to reopen, Goodearle J.
stated as follows (at para. 31):

 

                   An
application, brought in these circumstances, at this late date by the Crown
should never be allowed unless the effect of such evidence is of such apparent
strength as to be likely to convince the trier of fact that the verdict it (or
he) has reached, on the evidence originally adduced would be wrong and would
result in a palpable injustice to the accused. 

 

Clearly, where the interests of the
accused warrant reopening the Crown's case, a trial judge should exercise his
or her discretion accordingly, no matter how late in the proceeding it may be.

 

                   In summary, in
order to preserve the principle against self-incrimination and ensure that
accused persons are not compelled to assist in their own prosecution, the Crown
should not be allowed, except in the narrowest or most exceptional of
circumstances, to reopen its case once the defence has started to answer the case
against it.

 

 

Application to the Case at Bar

 

                   In this case, the
Crown had closed its case and the defence had been granted an adjournment to
deal with non-disclosure by the Crown of certain inculpatory statements made to
the police.  Before recessing, the defence announced that it would be calling
three witnesses, one of whom would be offering alibi evidence.  Upon resumption
of the trial approximately five weeks later, the Crown sought leave to reopen
its case in order to recall the complainant's mother to allow her to correct
her testimony as to the dates of the alleged sexual assaults.  The trial judge
permitted the Crown to reopen its case for the purpose of recalling the mother,
and then, subsequently, ruled in favour of the Crown's application to amend the
dates in the indictment to make them correspond with the mother's new
evidence.  The cumulative effect of the reopening and the amendment was, as
respondent's counsel phrased it, to ""obliterate"" the respondent's
alibi defence.

 

                   I am satisfied that
this is an appropriate case in which to interfere with the trial judge's
exercise of discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case.  Not only had the
defence started to ""meet"" the Crown's case by declaring its intention
to call evidence, but also the complainant's mother was recalled in order to
justify amending the charge.  The mother's fresh evidence had the effect of changing
the case which the accused had, by announcing his intention to call evidence
and particularly alibi evidence, committed himself to answering.

 

                   Reopening in this
case was contrary to the interests of justice and prejudicial to the accused
because it violated, indirectly, the fundamental tenet of our criminal justice
system that an accused must not be conscripted against himself.  To reach this
conclusion, I find it neither necessary nor appropriate to interfere with the
trial judge's findings of credibility as the Court of Appeal did.  In addition,
it is unnecessary to consider, as the Court of Appeal did, the second ground of
appeal, which is the question of whether the trial judge erred in allowing the
amendment to the indictment.

 

V.  Disposition

 

                   Because the
appropriate remedy in the circumstances would be to quash the conviction at
trial and replace it with a verdict of acquittal, the appeal is dismissed on
the ground that allowing the reopening of the Crown's case was an improper
exercise of the trial judge's discretion.

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. (dissenting) --
I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice and
Justice L'Heureux-Dubé who set forth the facts and judicial history, which I
adopt.  The Crown sought to reopen its case for the purpose of amending the
indictment.  The issue of reopening and the application for amendment are so
inextricably interlocked that I do not think they realistically can be dealt
with separately.  There can be no question that the later the stage at which an
application to amend an indictment is made, the greater the chance for
injustice to the accused, and consequently an amendment following the closing
of the Crown's case must be given very close scrutiny.  But it must be
remembered that the discretion of the trial judge is to be exercised in the
interests of justice ‑‑ which I would have thought comprised
consideration of both the interests of the accused and of the public, including
in the latter those of the victim.  This is not a purely technical decision. 
As Wilson J. put it in R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at p. 40,
""balance . . . must be maintained between eschewing unnecessary
technicalities and the right of an accused to make full answer and
defence"".

 

                   I fail to see how
the interests of the accused here could be said to have been prejudiced.  This
is not a case like R. v. Tremblay, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932, where the
amendment related to the nature of the charge.  Rather, the whole of the
Crown's case here centred on the fact that the offence had occurred at a time
when the accused resided with the parents of the complainant, the specific year
being the difficult matter to pinpoint.  The accused thus knew before
the reopening of the case that the incident had taken place when he had resided
with his niece.  Indeed, he knew this from the beginning; a police officer had
so informed him when he was arrested.  In short, the accused knew exactly the
case he had to meet from the beginning.  I do not think the accused's right
against self-incrimination or to silence were affected in any real sense.  The
case was reopened before the accused presented any evidence.

 

                   I would thus
dispose of this case in the manner proposed by L'Heureux-Dubé J.  Like her, I
would underline the difficulty of children pinpointing the exact time of
incidents which have occurred several years before, but which they are able to
define in terms of other contemporaneous matters.

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. (dissenting) -- The
respondent in this appeal has been charged with the indecent assault of his
niece contrary to s. 149(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
and with having sexual intercourse with her when she was under the age of 14,
contrary to s. 146(1), now s. 153(1) , of the Criminal Code .  An
important issue at trial concerned the dates when those alleged assaults took
place. The original charge read that the accused M.B.P. had on or between
January 1, 1980 and January 1, 1981 unlawfully assaulted the complainant. 
Pursuant to the evidence at the preliminary hearing, the Crown amended the
charge to specify that the assaults were alleged to have occurred between
January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983.  After the close of the Crown's case at
trial, however, before the defence adduced any evidence but after having
announced its reliance on an alibi defence for the above period, the Crown
sought to reopen its case in order to recall the complainant's mother so she
might correct her earlier testimony to reflect the actual period where the
incidents were alleged to have taken place.

 

                   The question before
this Court is whether it was an appropriate exercise of the trial judge's
discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case at that stage.  A second
intimately related question is whether the Crown should, in such circumstances,
be allowed to amend the indictment to conform with the evidence entered at
trial. This involves consideration of s. 601  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , the relevant parts of which read as follows:  

 

 

                          601. . . .

 

                          (2)
Subject to this section, a court may, on the trial of an indictment, amend the
indictment or a count therein or a particular that is furnished under section
587, to make the indictment, count or particular conform to the evidence, where
there is a variance between the evidence and

 

(a)
a count in the indictment as preferred; or 

 

                          (b)
a count in the indictment

 

                   (i)
as amended; or

 

(ii)
as it would have been if it had been amended in conformity with any particular
that has been furnished pursuant to section 587.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   (4)
The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made to
the indictment or a count thereof under subsection (3), consider

 

(a)
the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry;

 

                          (b)
the evidence taken on the trial, if any;

 

                          (c)
the circumstances of the case;

 

(d)
whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by any
variance, error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3); and

                          

                          (e)
whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.

                   (4.1)
A variance between the indictment or a count therein and the evidence taken is
not material with respect to

 

                   (a)
the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, if it is proved
that the indictment was preferred within the prescribed period of limitation,
if any; . . .

 

In order to answer these questions, a
review of the evidence, as to the period when the offences are alleged to have
taken place, is essential. 

 

The Evidence 

 

                   At trial, the
complainant, who was 16 years of age at the time, testified that the
occurrences of sexual abuse by her uncle, the respondent, took place eight
years earlier, in the summer of 1982.  Although the complainant tied her
testimony to a fixed year, throughout the trial of this matter the exact date
of those events had proven difficult for the complainant to remember with
precision.  Although the complainant's testimony was consistent with the dates
mentioned in the indictment, she pinpointed the timing of the abuse on the fact
that the incidents occurred during the summer when the respondent lived with
her family and, in particular, on a summer weekend when the complainant's
parents went away with their van club, at which time the respondent was
responsible for baby-sitting her.  Based on these recollections, the
complainant and her mother concluded that the incidents occurred in 1982.  The
complainant explained how this date was arrived at:

 

. .
. I could remember that I was little and my mother had showed me pictures of
myself from school years and I could remember what I looked like and I showed
my mother the picture of what I looked like when it all happened and she had
taken the pictures out of her photo album of when she went on the trip with the
van club to Niagara Falls and the date is in the bottom of my mother's pictures
and it says 1982 and the picture of me was taken in `82.

 

                   The complainant's
mother testified with regard to the period when the respondent had lived with
her and her family, that is, for two months during the summer of 1982.  She
further testified that she and her husband had taken a van trip to Rochester,
New York in July 1982 and that the respondent had baby-sat her daughter.  At
this point, the Crown closed its case and the respondent indicated that he
would be calling three witnesses, one of whom was an alibi.  When the trial
resumed on April 22, 1991, the Crown sought to reopen its case, which was
allowed by the trial judge, and the complainant's mother was recalled.  She
stated that she had erred in calculating the date when the accused had lived
with her family and now recalled that it was the summer of 1983 instead of
1982:

 

                   Racking
my brains out trying to figure out, trying to remember when he lived here, when
he lived with us. I have no rent receipts, I have nothing to prove when he
lived at my house, I had to go by my memory and what my daughter could
remember, so going through the pictures and trying to do my homework, I
remember the yard sale, his family leaving and that he lived there then. 

 

Following that testimony, the Crown
was allowed to amend the indictment in order that the period be changed to read
January 1, 1982 to January 1, 1984.

 

                   When testifying in
his own defence, the respondent confirmed that he had lived with the
complainant and her family in their home for a period of one to one and a half
months during the summer of 1983.  He recalled the events described by the
complainant's mother which had enabled her to determine the period when the
respondent had lived with them.  With regard to the specific incidents of
abuse, the respondent said that, during that period, he barely saw the family
as he worked at two jobs and was out of the house most of the time.  Moreover,
he did not recall having baby-sat the complainant for a weekend during his
stay.  However, he also testified that, at that time, he was drinking heavily
and, when pressed on cross-examination, made several contradictory statements
with regard to the van club weekend.  To various questions, he answered that he
had no recollection of the weekend because he usually went away on the weekends,
that he was not there on that particular weekend and, finally, that he did not
remember.  

 

                   Prior to the trial,
the respondent had also made a number of contradictory statements to the police
in response to the accusations.  In both oral and written statements, he said:

 

It
could have happened.  I had a problem with alcohol and drinking. I did a lot of
stupid things when I was drunk. I'm not sure in my mind that it didn't happen. 
I was probably more than capable of doing it the way I was drinking back then. 
Obviously it did occur.  I feel pretty upset.  That may have been me then but
it's not me now.

 

This
happened a long time ago.  I remember that period of time.  I was drinking
quite a bit at the time.  At the time I had a problem with alcohol and back
then I did a lot of stupid things when I was drunk.  

 

It
probably could have happened at that time.  I don't have any recollection of it
at this time. 

 

I
don't feel good about it, obviously something did happen.  I was a very heavy
drinker at the time.  

 

Analysis

                   In answer to the
two issues this Court has to decide, which are set out in the Chief Justice's
opinion and to which I referred earlier, the Chief Justice would dismiss the
appeal ""on the ground that allowing the reopening of the Crown's case was
an improper exercise of the trial judge's discretion"" (p. 589).  I
disagree.  As to the amendment sought by the Crown in order that the indictment
reflect the evidence at trial, while the Chief Justice is ""not convinced
that the respondent suffered any irreparable prejudice by the mere fact of the
amendment to the dates specified in the indictment"" (p. 566), he does not
reach a determinative conclusion on this basis.  

 

                   I am of the view
that the amendment to the indictment was properly allowed by the trial judge,
as was the reopening of the case.  Neither of these procedural incidents
altered the case which the accused had to answer.  In the words of the Chief
Justice himself, ""the respondent knew what was alleged against him from
the outset.  He had been made aware at the time of his arrest that the relevant
period during which he was alleged to have sexually assaulted the complainant
was when he was living at her parents' house"" (p. 567).  Consequently,
there could be no prejudice of any kind which the respondent suffered or could
have suffered by the amendment and the reopening of the case to that end. 
Before dealing more specifically with these two points, it may be useful to
recall the context in which these motions were sought.

 

The Context

 

                   These accusations
relate to sexual offences against a young girl under 14 years of age by her
adult uncle.  At the time of the trial, the complainant was 16 years of age. 
The offences having occurred approximately eight years earlier, when the
respondent was living in the complainant's parents' home, the complainant had
difficulty pinpointing the specific dates.  In this regard, as the Chief
Justice notes, ""courts, including this one, have accepted that, in cases
involving offences and particularly sexual offences against young children,
absolute precision with respect to the timing of an alleged offence will often
be unrealistic and unnecessary"" (p. 567).  See Vézina v. The Queen,
[1986] 1 S.C.R. 2; R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30; R. v. Khan,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, and R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122.  

 

                   This Court's
reasons in R. v. B. (G.), supra, which thoroughly dealt with the
issue of amendment, are particularly apposite to the case at hand.  In that
case, three young offenders were charged with having sexually assaulted a
seven-year-old girl between December 2 and 20, 1985.  The young complainant, who
was eight years old at the time of the trial, testified that the assault had
occurred during the winter she was in grade one. Her mother supported her
testimony and attested that the complainant had experienced various problems
such as bed-wetting and nightmares during late 1985 and 1986.  Following this
testimony, counsel for the defence pointed out that the complainant had, in
fact, been in grade one in the fall of 1984 and not 1985.  The Crown sought to
amend the indictment to read between November 1, 1985 and December 20, 1985. 
The trial judge refused to allow the amendment and the three accused were
acquitted.  On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the acquittal was
overturned on the basis that the time of the offence was not an essential
element of the crime.  On further appeal, the judgment of the Court of Appeal
was upheld.  Wilson J. for the Supreme Court said (at p. 40): 

 

balance
. . . must be maintained between eschewing unnecessary technicalities and the
right of an accused to make full answer and defence. . . .

 

According to her, as long as the 
accused was provided with enough information in the indictment to identify the
circumstances of the charge and to prepare a defence to these accusations, 
time was not an essential element of the offence of sexual assault.

 

                   The present day
context of child sexual abuse indicates that each year, in Canada, the number
of children who are victims of sexual abuse increases (Report of the Committee
on Sexual Offences Against Children and Youths, Sexual Offences Against
Children (1984)).  In fact, according to the Department of Justice,
Research Section in Sexual Assault Legislation in Canada: An Evaluation,
(Report No. 5 1990), at p. 28, reports of sex crimes increased over 100
percent to 29,111 offences across Canada from 1983 to 1988.   Further, some
researchers estimate that almost 80 percent of sex crimes are committed against
children and teenagers (N. Bala and M. Bailey, ""Canada: Recognizing the
Interests of Children"" (1992-93), 31 J. Fam. L. 283, at p. 292).  

 

                   Judicial
recognition of this reality, however, is not new and has, in fact, been
commented on by our Court in R. v. W. (R.), supra, by McLachlin
J., whose remarks are very apposite to the situation at hand at p. 133:

 

One
finds emerging a new sensitivity to the peculiar perspectives of children. 
Since children may experience the world differently from adults, it is hardly
surprising that details important to adults, like time and place, may be
missing from their recollection.  Wilson J. recognized this in R. v. B. (G.),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 54-55, when, in referring to submissions regarding
the court of appeal judge's treatment of the evidence of the complainant, she
said that 

 

. .
. it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary should take a
common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young children and not
impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on adults. . . .  While
children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when
and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have
misconceived what happened to them and who did it.

 

It is crucial that similar
considerations be had in the case at hand.  Mere technicalities cannot be
allowed to hamper the administration of justice, especially in the context of
child sexual abuse, particularly when no prejudice of any kind can result to
the accused.

 

The Reopening of the Crown's Case

 

                   In the Chief
Justice's opinion the trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to reopen its
case at such a late stage in the proceedings, particularly since, in his view,
the respondent was prejudiced because he had begun to answer the case against
him by stating that he would be calling three witnesses one of whom would testify
as to his alibi during the period mentioned in the indictment, that is the
summer of 1982.  In reaching his determination, the Chief Justice reviews the
leading case of Robillard v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 728, and,
although he agrees with Pigeon J. that a trial judge has a wide discretion to
reopen a case, he suggests that Robillard should be limited to its own
facts.  In so doing, the Chief Justice attaches great significance to the stage
of the trial when such reopening was allowed.  I disagree.  In my view, unless Robillard
is overruled, it is the law and it cannot be distinguished from the facts of
this case, even limited to its own facts.

 

                   In Robillard,
the Supreme Court abolished the artificial distinction historically made
between the discretion to allow the reopening of the Crown's case before, as
opposed to after, the defence has commenced answering the case against it.  The
appellant Robillard was charged with armed robbery.  An accomplice identified
him at the preliminary inquiry as one of the robbers, but refused to testify at
the trial.  The evidence given at the preliminary inquiry was read to the jury
at the trial and the Crown closed its case.  The accused did not call any
evidence and the defence closed its case.  After the Crown had addressed the
jury, counsel for the accused argued, in his address to the jury, that the
appellant had not been identified at trial as the ""Robillard""
referred to in the accomplice's testimony.  As a result, the Crown moved that
the inquiry be reopened to permit evidence to be adduced on the identification
issue.  The trial judge granted the Crown's motion and the appellant was
convicted.  Both the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada
dismissed the appeal.  Pigeon J., writing for the unanimous Court, held (at p.
732):

 

A
trial judge may allow the Crown to submit additional evidence after the Crown
has closed its case, and this discretionary power is not subject to the strict
limitation mentioned by Sloan J.A. in Kishen Singh.

 

In his reasons, Pigeon J. expressly
rejected Sloan J.A.'s  comments in R. v. Kishen Singh (1941), 76 C.C.C.
248 (B.C.C.A.),  at p. 251, that the trial judge's power to reopen exists only
if ""some matter arises ex improviso which no human ingenuity could
have foreseen"".  On the contrary, Pigeon J. clearly stated (at pp. 732 and
733) that:

 

(1)
the trial judge has the discretionary power to permit the correction of an
omission or inadvertence in the evidence; and

 

(2)
such discretionary power should not be interfered with unless an injustice has
resulted.

 

Applying these principles to the
facts, Pigeon J. was of the view that the fact that the defence had closed its
case was not a factor to be taken into consideration in the review of the trial
judge's exercise of discretion.  Robillard clearly provides that,
whether the Crown seeks to reopen its case before or after the defence has
closed its case, the trial judge may exercise his or her discretion to reopen
the case in order to correct an omission in the evidence on the sole condition
that no unfairness to the opposing party results.  In brief, although it may be
more likely that there will be prejudice from the fact that the reopening of
the case occurred at a late stage of the trial as the Chief Justice noted, it
will not automatically be the case, even if such reopening occurred after the
defence had closed its case.

 

                   This Court's
conclusion in Robillard is consistent with earlier jurisprudence. 
Pigeon J. (at p. 733) cited R. v. Huluszkiw (1962), 37 C.R. 386 (Ont.
C.A.) as authority for the proposition that a trial judge's discretionary power
to allow a reopening of the case should not be interfered with unless it is
unfair.  In Huluszkiw, McLennan J.A., allowing the reopening and the
appeal, held (at p. 390):

 

                   It
would be unfortunate if the ends of justice were defeated by the inadvertence
of counsel in failing to prove what is essentially a matter of form in
relation to procedure and provided always that the calling of further evidence,
whatever its character, is for an honest purpose and that there are no unfair
consequences to the opposite party so far as the presentation of that case is
concerned. [Emphasis added.]

 

Robillard has been both applied and further developed in
subsequent cases. In R. v. Assu (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 94, a case of
drug possession, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, referring to its
previous decision in R. v. Champagne, [1970] 2 C.C.C. 273, allowed the
appeal on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying the Crown's motion
to reopen the inquiry in order to prove the nature and the quality of the
substance described in the certificate of analyst.  Notwithstanding the fact
that the Crown made the request to reopen its case in the middle of the defence
evidence, Carrothers J.A. made no distinction as to the moment when the
application to reopen the inquiry is made, when he said (at p. 96):

 

. .
. the ends of justice are not to be defeated by inadvertence of counsel in a
matter of form in relation to procedure and where there is no prejudice and no
unfair consequences to the opposite party so far as the presentation of the
case is concerned. 

 

                   Similarly, in Thatcher
v. The Queen, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 97 (appeal dismissed by the Supreme Court of
Canada but on grounds not dealing with the reopening, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652), the
majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed Thatcher's appeal on the
ground that the rule in Robillard, supra, had been correctly
applied by the trial judge.  In the view of the Court of Appeal, the trial
judge properly exercised his discretion in allowing the Crown, following the
receipt of new information, to reopen its case to call a witness, regardless of
the fact that the defence was by then closed.  (See also R. v. Karens,
B.C. Co. Ct., Vernon Reg. No. 14035, January 31, 1986, [1986] B.C.J. No. 2165
(QL), and Protection de la jeunesse -- 449, [1990] R.J.Q. 2367 (Ct.
Qué., Youth Div.), which have applied and expanded on Robillard, supra.)

 

                   This brief overview
of the jurisprudence prior to and following this Court's judgment in Robillard,
supra, makes it amply clear that a trial judge has wide discretion to
allow the reopening of the case and that such discretion, as long as it is
exercised in a manner which does not result in injustice or prejudice to the
parties, should not be interfered with.  Although it may be that, in certain
circumstances, it will be more likely that prejudice may arise if the case is
reopened later rather than earlier in the trial, in my view, Robillard
has definitely eliminated the distinction between cases where the reopening is
sought prior to and those where such reopening is sought after the defence has
started to answer the case against it, where no prejudice is demonstrated.  The
Chief Justice's analysis is predicated, in my view, on the very narrow and
legalistic approach which prevailed before Robillard and which Robillard
has definitely abolished.  In fact, the Chief Justice's treatment of the
reopening of cases virtually overrules Robillard, an issue which was
neither pleaded before us nor was the parties' contention.

 

                   The respondent's
whole argument rests on the alleged prejudice resulting from the fact that he
could no longer present an alibi defence as regards the amended period during
which the alleged assaults occurred and that he was prejudiced by advancing a
certain strategy.  It is clear, and the Chief Justice himself agrees that, in
the circumstances of this case, no prejudice could have ensued to the
respondent from the fact that the dates do reflect the evidence and the defence
of alibi could no longer succeed on these facts.  

 

                   Contrary to what
the Chief Justice asserts, the reopening of the Crown's case  in no way
affected the case against the accused.  The offence was one of indecent assault
and sexual intercourse with the complainant who was under 14 years of age while
the respondent lived at the complainant's parents' house.  The dates were
immaterial; the respondent knew throughout that the acts were alleged to have
occurred when he lived with the complainant and her family.  There was no
prejudice or denial of full answer and defence in depriving the defence of the
opportunity of relying on an irrelevant detail by allowing the Crown to submit
fresh evidence which did not change the essential features of the case which
the defence had to meet.  The key to this flexibility is, in my view, rooted in
B. (G.), supra, in which this Court recognized the difficulties
of pinpointing the exact date of sexual assaults against children and the need
to accommodate this difficulty in our criminal justice system.  A similar
approach was advanced by the English Court of Appeal in R. v. Scott
(1984), 79 Cr. App. R. 49, in which the court overturned the rule laid down in R.
v. Pilcher (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 1, and concluded that the reopening will
depend on the discretion of the trial judge and what could reasonably have been
foreseen based on the facts of the particular case and, finally, whether there
is prejudice on the specific facts of the case.

 

                     The only reason
that the Crown sought to reopen its case was because the young abuse victim
could not recall the precise dates of events which occurred eight years
earlier, although she was able to identify the period during which it occurred,
a period the respondent himself recognized.  Common sense dictates that the
same exacting standard cannot apply in such circumstances as it perhaps should
in others.  In light of the context of child sexual abuse and the difficulty
that children have in determining exact dates and times of occurrences and,
most often, have to rely on recollections of surrounding events as well as the
assistance of others, courts must not unduly limit and complicate the trial
judge's discretion to reopen the case with inordinate technicalities.  The
reopening of the Crown's case was, in the words of McLennan J.A. in Huluszkiw,
""for an honest purpose and . . . there are no unfair consequences to the
[respondent] so far as the presentation of that case is concerned"" (p.
390).  The respondent always knew the case to be met and that he was accused of
having fondled the complainant and of having sexual intercourse with her on two
occasions during the summer that he lived with the complainant and her family,
particularly during the weekend that the respondent was responsible for
baby-sitting her.  The test for injustice, in my view, is one of actual
prejudice to the defence and in the case at hand no such prejudice was suffered
by the respondent.  The Crown did not seek to reopen its case as a consequence
of the defence statements but, rather, in order to remedy an inaccurate
testimony that arose through human error.  Since the defence counsel was able
to seek an adjournment and re-cross-examine the witness, any minimal
inconvenience that may have arisen could easily have been remedied.   Although
I agree with the Chief Justice that there must be great value placed on the
right of an accused to silence and the presumption against self-incrimination,
in my view these rights have not been violated in the case at hand and the
reopening of this case clearly meets the limited circumstances set out in Robillard. 
The trial judge properly allowed the Crown to reopen its case in order to
accord with the principles advanced by this Court in B. (G.), supra,
and to correct a simple matter of inadvertence given the fact that time is
generally not an essential aspect of the offence of sexual assault in cases
involving children.  Thus, in so doing, no injustice arose to the respondent
M.B.P. 

 

                   Finally, it is
clear, in my view, that the reopening and amendment will often be closely
linked in cases of child sexual assault.  With this in mind, I now turn to the
issue of the amendment.

 

The Amendment

 

                   The Criminal
Code , s. 601 , specifically confers on a trial judge the discretion to
permit an amendment to the indictment in the absence of prejudice.  More
specifically still, s. 601(4.1)  deals with amending the time period mentioned
in an indictment.  This section was added in 1985 (S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 123(3))
and codifies the common law rule that the date of an offence need not be proven
unless it is an ""essential element"" of the offence pursuant to R.
v. Dossi (1918), 13 Cr. App. R. 158 (C.C.A.).

 

                   The respondent's
main argument rests on the defence of alibi which, in his view, he intended to
use and could have used as regards the period mentioned in the amended
indictment, alleging the abuse to have occurred between January 1, 1982 to January
1, 1983.  As the Chief Justice points out (at p. 567), ""[t]he fact that an
accused may have an alibi for the period (or part of the period) described in
an indictment does not necessarily or automatically ""freeze"" the
dates specified in that indictment.  That is to say, there is no vested right
to a given alibi.  Alibi evidence must respond to the case as presented by the
Crown, and not the other way around.""  Besides, the availability of a
particular defence is no bar to the application of s. 601 , just as a defence
prompted by a simple error or inadvertence by a complainant or Crown cannot be
in the interest of justice.  This is precisely why s. 601  was enacted -- to
avoid having technicalities impair the truth-seeking function of the courts. 
It seems to me that the amendment here sought by the Crown was precisely for
those reasons and fell squarely within the trial judge's discretion.  The trial
judge, who had heard all the evidence adduced by the Crown before allowing the
amendment, was in the best position to assess whether or not the respondent was
or could be prejudiced by the amendment.  He clearly put his mind to it when he
said:

 

. .
. there is always difficulty of pinpointing the exact date because of the age
of these complainants in trying to remember the time.                                           

. .
. the incidences are not changed, we are talking here of people trying to
recall a certain date by certain events and the young complainant related it to
the van trip.  Somebody has made a mistake in the summer of the van trip.  I do
not believe that this will prejudice the accused in amending that date.

 

The Court of Appeal failed to
recognize that a finding that the appellant has not been able to rely on the
defence of alibi does not necessarily render the amendment prejudicial.  In my
view, as set out above, it is sufficient that the accused was aware of the case
he had to meet and that the offences were alleged to have occurred during the
summer he lived with the complainant and her family.  As a consequence, the
conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the amendment ""materially
changed"" the case against the accused to an ""altogether different
case"" is a distortion of the facts of the case at hand.  The Court of
Appeal erred in substituting its own assessment of the prejudice to the accused
for that of the trial judge.  Besides, there was no prejudice in this case
since the respondent was fully aware of the period the complainant was
referring to.  The respondent's arguments must, accordingly,  fail and the
decision of the trial judge must be upheld.

 

Conclusion

 

                   In the result, I
conclude that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion to allow both
the reopening of the case and the amendment to the indictment.  I would accordingly
allow the appeal, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction.

                   The accused were
charged with offences involving conspiracy to traffic in controlled drugs and
narcotics.  A substantial part of the evidence against them consisted of
recordings of telephone conversations intercepted pursuant to nine wiretap
authorizations.  The District Court judge presiding at the trial granted the
accused's application to open the packets containing the material filed in
support of the authorizations, stated his intention to remove the affidavits
and advised counsel of the procedure he was adopting to edit the affidavits. 
No counsel objected to the proposed procedure.  The trial judge initially
edited the affidavits on his own according to his understanding of the
principles set out in Parmar and, in his opinion, made deletions
""only insofar as [the affidavits] contain information from informants and
others which is to be protected, and insofar as they contain summary or
opinion"".  He proceeded to review the edited affidavits with the Crown and
accepted its submissions as to the nature and extent of the editing.  The
accused and their counsel were present throughout this exercise.  The edited
affidavits were distributed to defence counsel who made submissions regarding
the deletions.  The trial judge mentioned again that he had only deleted
informants' information and, in one or two cases, some ""commentary"". 
He did not accede to defence counsel's requests for more information as to the
content of the affidavits, although he did inform them as to whether the
accused were named in the deleted portions of the affidavits and proceeded to
list those accused in the deleted portions of the nine affidavits.  When
defence counsel pointed out that the deletions by the trial judge went beyond
those made from the same affidavits by the judge who presided over an earlier
trial of a first group of accused, the trial judge indicated that the editing
of the other judge was irrelevant to his editing task.  The accused filed a Wilson
application to set aside the seven District Court authorizations.  At the
hearing, the accused cross‑examined for nine full days the three police
officers who swore the affidavits in support of the authorizations but were not
allowed to cross‑examine the ""sub‑affiants"" who supplied
information to them.  However, the trial judge granted the accused leave to
call two additional police officers as witnesses.  At the conclusion of the
hearing, the trial judge dismissed the application.  The accused then brought a
motion to quash this ruling and sought prohibition in the Ontario Supreme Court
to prevent the trial judge from admitting primary evidence obtained from the
District Court authorizations.  This motion was dismissed.  Concurrently, the
accused brought a second Wilson application to set aside the two Ontario
Supreme Court authorizations.  The judge edited the affidavits filed in support
of these authorizations less extensively than the trial judge and dismissed the
application.  The trial resumed and the accused were convicted. The majority of
the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions.  The issue in this Court is whether
the trial judge's editing of the affidavits prevented a proper and full inquiry
into the validity of the authorizations, thereby depriving the accused of the
right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeals should be allowed and a new
trial ordered.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory and
Major JJ.:  The Charter  guarantee of the right to make full answer
and defence requires that, as a general rule, all relevant information in the
possession of the state be disclosed to an accused.  Accordingly, when
determining whether the contents of wiretap affidavits should be disclosed to
an accused, full disclosure should also be the rule subject to certain
exceptions.  To justify non‑disclosure, the Crown must show that
disclosure will prejudice the interests of informants, innocent persons or law
enforcement authorities and that such prejudice overbears the interests of the
accused.  When non‑disclosure is justified, the affidavits should only be
edited to the extent necessary to protect these overriding public interests. 
While trial judges must be granted some discretion to determine what editing is
required to ensure that the public interest is protected, that discretion does
not include the power to edit material whose continued confidentiality clearly
is not justified by any of the public interest concerns in non‑disclosure. 
Here, the trial judge did not comply with Parmar in editing the
affidavits more extensively than was necessary to protect the public interest. 
The affidavits as edited by the judge who presided over the earlier trial were
relevant and should have been the starting point for the trial judge. In
editing out from the same affidavits information that had not been edited by
the other judge, and was therefore public, the trial judge ignored the basic
rule of non‑disclosure that it is only confidential information that
qualifies.  Furthermore, the trial judge excised not only information which
might tend to identify informants, but also information obtained from
informants and others, and material which he characterized as ""commentary"",
""summary"" or ""opinion"".  Editing is to be kept to a minimum
and this principle clearly was not respected in this case.  Given the
conclusion that the trial judge did not comply with the principles set out in Parmar,
subsequently approved of by this Court in Garofoli, in determining what
to edit, it is unnecessary to decide whether or not the procedure adopted by
the trial judge in editing the affidavits was in accordance with the procedure
suggested by the authorities.

 

                   By showing that the
trial judge excised a substantial amount of material whose continued
confidentiality could not be justified on the basis of the factors set out in Parmar,
the accused have established prima facie that their ability to make full
answer and defence was prejudiced in that they were denied the opportunity to
conduct a full inquiry into the validity of the wiretap authorizations
challenged before the trial judge.  The accused should not be required to
demonstrate the specific use to which they might put information which they
have not even seen.  The Crown has not been able to establish that no prejudice
occurred and an appellate court which does not have the benefit of access to
counsel's brief cannot be expected to speculate in these circumstances.  While
the affidavits as edited by the trial judge disclosed sufficient grounds to
sustain the relevant authorizations, the material contained in the excised
portions of the affidavits could be used to impugn the contents of the
affidavits which have been disclosed.  In the absence of overriding policy
concerns which justified confidentiality, the accused were entitled to have the
opportunity to use the deleted material in this fashion.  Even though the trial
judge reviewed the material which had been deleted from the affidavits in
assessing the validity of the authorizations, this judicial screening of the
material which was improperly withheld from the accused did not cure the
failure to make proper disclosure.  The fact that the trial judge may not have
seen how the excised material could have assisted the accused does not
necessarily mean that defence counsel would not have found a way to use that
material to their advantage.

 

                   The trial judge
erred in editing the affidavits in such a way that the accused were denied the
right to make full answer and defence and this error cannot be cured by the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  It
is impossible to say that the verdicts against the accused would necessarily
have been the same if the defence had succeeded in establishing that even one
of the impugned authorizations was invalid.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  The procedure followed by the trial judge and
his editing of the affidavits did not deprive the accused of their right to
make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter .  In drug trafficking and conspiracy cases, the balance
between the protection of both society and informers and the respect of the
individual rights of the accused has been struck in s. 187  of the Criminal
Code  and these rules were respected in this case.

 

                   The trial judge did
not err in editing the affidavits on his own before receiving any submissions
in open court from the Crown as to the nature of the matters to be edited and
the basis therefor.  The procedure for the disclosure of the contents of
wiretap affidavits to an accused was set out by this Court in Garofoli
after the trial in this case and it was not intended to be exclusive or
exhaustive.  Here, the trial judge followed Parmar, which was regarded
as setting out the proper procedure at the time.  The Crown was consulted and
had an input during the editing process, and the trial judge remained open to
suggestions by both counsel, who were present throughout the exercise.  As long
as the Crown has the opportunity to effectively indicate its position with
respect to the editing, it is not material whether its submissions are made
before or after the editing.

 

                   The trial judge's
failure to provide judicial summaries of his deletions did not impair the
accused's case.  No request was made for the summaries at the time of the
editing and no specific reason was given or facts demonstrated by the accused
with respect to the need for summaries in the circumstances of this case.

 

                   In editing the
affidavits, a trial judge must decide in his discretion what portions should be
edited and to what extent, bearing in mind the protection of the interests of
the state in its investigation techniques and in non‑disclosure of
informers' identity.  Such discretion is not only subjective, but depends on
the facts and the context of the case.  While, in some circumstances, deleting
the names and addresses of informers will be sufficient for their protection,
this is not necessarily so in each case.  The protection of police informers is
crucial to the proper administration of justice and the slightest detail that
might help identify an informer must be deleted, especially as here in cases of
drug‑related offences and organized networks of narcotic distribution. In
balancing the interests of the accused and the public interest in the
administration of justice, the trial judge deleted information from informers
from the affidavits on the basis that such information was likely to lead to
their identification.  In so doing, the trial judge was perhaps overly cautious
in his attempt to protect the identity of the informers and the nature of the
undercover operation.  Nevertheless, this was within his discretion and could not
amount to an error of law in the absence of a denial of justice or of full and
fair defence.

 

                   The specific issue
of possible loss of confidentiality of some informers was not raised when the
accused had an opportunity to present submissions with respect to the trial
judge's editing and they cannot today, without more, challenge the deletions of
information identifying informers whose identity may no longer have been
confidential by the time of the trial.  At the time of the editing, there was
no way for the trial judge to know whether, at the time of trial, such
confidentiality would become unnecessary.  Nothing in the record indicates that
the trial judge was informed that the material in the affidavits edited out by
the judge who presided over the earlier trial was not, or had ceased to be,
confidential and, therefore, could be released.  The trial judge could not have
presumed, at the time of his editing, that the version of the affidavits as
edited and released at the earlier trial was not confidential anymore.

 

                   While the deletions
of immaterial information (""commentary"", ""summary"" or
""opinion"") may be more questionable, these deletions were minor and
were irrelevant as a basis for the issuing of the authorizations.  Moreover,
this falls within the trial judge's discretion and it is not enough to
constitute unfairness and warrant a new trial.

 

                   The argument that
material contained in excised portions of affidavits could have assisted
accused is largely self‑defeating and simply ignores the continuing need
for confidentiality.  

 

                   Finally, a
comparison of the editing made by other judges with the editing made by the
trial judge on the same affidavits is not relevant.  In the exercise of their
discretion, judges might hold different views and come to different
conclusions.  As long as the exercise of discretion is made judiciously and
judicially, there is no ground for reproach.

 

                   There is therefore
nothing in the treatment of the sealed packets by the trial judge which
constituted a reviewable error.  Even assuming that his deletions were
excessive to the point of amounting to an error, however, no prejudice
resulting from those deletions was demonstrated.  Despite a lengthy cross‑examination
of the affiants and two additional witnesses, the accused were unable to
demonstrate that the authorizations were facially deficient, that the edited
affidavits failed to set out reasonable and probable grounds or that the
affiants committed fraud, misleading disclosure or non‑disclosure in
their request for the wiretap authorizations.  Counsel for the accused
recognized in this Court that had the affidavits submitted to the judge in
order to obtain the authorizations been the edited affidavits, such affidavits
would have been sufficient for the issuing of the authorizations.  In these
circumstances, no prejudice can be found.  The purpose of a review is to
ascertain that the authorizations were properly issued, not to permit accused
to go on fishing expeditions to attempt to identify informers, which would be
an abuse of the process in itself. The grounds of appeal did not reveal any
miscarriage of justice and were worded in pure legal technicalities which have
no bearing on the innocence or the guilt of the accused.

I.Facts

 

                   The appellants were
among some 80 individuals simultaneously arrested on January 22, 1985 after the
culmination of a police investigation into the manufacture and distribution of
illicit drugs by members of two motorcycle clubs.

 

                   The Crown initially
laid a single information against 61 individuals charging them with conspiracy
to traffic in methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD.  A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for December 2, 1985.  However, in November 1985 the Honourable John
Crosbie, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, preferred two
indictments, replacing the original information and cancelling the preliminary
hearing.  One indictment was presented in the Supreme Court of Ontario and
named 12 accused.  The other indictment was presented in the District Court of
Ontario and named 27 accused including the appellants.  The appellants
Farinacci and Lépine were jointly charged with one count of conspiracy to
traffic in methamphetamine between October 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  The
appellant Jeffreys was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in
cocaine between June 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  

 

                   The trial in the
Supreme Court of Ontario proceeded first.  It began on June 2, 1986 before
Bowlby J.  Verdicts were rendered on February 27, 1987. 

 

                   The appellants and
seven other accused were tried in the District Court of Ontario before Judge
O'Connell and a jury.  That trial began on May 11, 1987.  Pre-trial motions
were heard throughout May, June and September.  Verdicts were rendered on June
11, 1988.  The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were convicted of conspiracy to
traffic in methamphetamine.  The appellant Jeffreys was convicted of conspiracy
to traffic in cocaine.  The evidence against the appellants consisted of
testimony from informant witnesses, results of physical surveillance and
recordings of telephone conversations.

 

                   One of the
pre-trial motions entertained by the trial judge was a ""Wilson""
motion (named after the decision of this Court in Wilson v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 594) in which the appellants challenged the validity of seven
wiretap authorizations which permitted the police to intercept their telephone
conversations.  The impugned authorizations were granted by Judge Scott of the
District Court of Ontario.  Two other authorizations were granted by Trainor
and Ewaschuk JJ., both of the Supreme Court of Ontario.

 

                   Prior to the Wilson
hearing, the trial judge ordered the packets containing the material filed in
support of all the authorizations to be opened.  He then stated his intention
to remove the affidavits from the sealed packet and edit them.  He explained
that after editing the affidavits himself he would give a copy of the edited
affidavits to the Crown to determine if further editing needed to be done.  He
would then give copies to counsel for the various accused and hear any
""suggestions"" they had about the affidavits.

 

                   After the
adjournment, the trial judge indicated that he had read each affidavit in light
of the decision in Parmar.  He claimed to have edited the affidavits
""only insofar as they contain information from informants and others which
is to be protected, and insofar as they contain summary or opinion"".  He
then proceeded to review the edited affidavits with the Crown, who suggested a
few additional deletions.  In a few instances the Crown indicated that material
edited by the trial judge could be disclosed.  These suggestions were adopted
by the trial judge.  The accused and their counsel were present throughout this
exercise.

 

                   The trial judge
then proposed to distribute the edited affidavits to counsel.  However, before
this took place, counsel for the appellant Farinacci made a submission
requesting ""all information contained in these affidavits, other than the
specific name and identifying address, or the like of anybody who purports to
be in the position of an informant or informer, as the case may be"".  The
Crown argued that this submission was premature.  The trial judge agreed.  At
that point counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested clarification of the
procedure which the trial judge intended to follow.   He specifically asked
whether the appellants would ""have some input to request further
information from the affidavits"".  The trial judge made it clear that the
next step in the process was that the defence would receive copies of the
edited affidavits and then the actual Wilson hearing would proceed.

 

                   Once the edited
affidavits were distributed to counsel, but before reviewing them, counsel for
the appellant Farinacci, relying heavily on the decision in Parmar,
re-asserted the right of the defence to the deleted information.  Counsel for
the appellant Jeffreys requested an indication of the basis upon which the
deletions were made.  The trial judge then suggested that every deletion met
all four criteria set out in Parmar.  However, he also stated that in
one or two cases he had deleted some ""commentary"".

 

                   After counsel were
given an opportunity to review the edited affidavits, counsel for the appellant
Farinacci again attempted to make submissions regarding the deletions that had
been made.  Counsel pointed out that the deletions made by the trial judge went
beyond those which were made from the same affidavits by Bowlby J.  The trial
judge characterized the deletions which had been made by Bowlby J. as
""irrelevant"" to what he was doing.

 

                   Counsel for the
appellant Farinacci then asked about a specific deletion from one of the
affidavits, asking if it was appropriate to inquire into whether his client's
name appeared in the deleted materials and in what context.  The trial judge
indicated that it was not appropriate for him to inquire, stating that the
deletion was made ""in the interests of the persons involved"" and that
all the deletions he made ""were strictly related to informants, and one or
two other minor deletions which related to commentary..."".

 

                   Counsel for the
appellant Jeffreys stated that the defence were, at least prima facie,
entitled to all information reflecting on the reasonable and probable grounds
upon which the authorizations were granted.  The trial judge flatly rejected
this submission.

 

                   The Crown submitted
that ""[t]he accused are entitled to know if they are named in the deleted
portions.""  The trial judge then proceeded to list those accused named in
the deleted portions of the nine affidavits.  Defence counsel was also advised
that no confidential sources had died, were potential Crown witnesses or were
police officers.

 

                   At the Wilson
hearing, the appellants cross-examined the three police officers who swore
affidavits in support of the nine authorizations.  The trial judge ruled that
defence counsel could not cross-examine the ""sub-affiants"" who
supplied information to the affiants.  However, he granted the appellants leave
to call two additional police officers as witnesses.  On June 24, 1987 the
trial judge dismissed the application to set aside the seven District Court
authorizations.

 

                   Shortly after this
hearing, the appellants brought an application before Watt J. to set aside the
two Supreme Court authorizations.  Watt J. edited the affidavits filed in
support of these authorizations less extensively than O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.
had edited the same affidavits before distributing them to defence counsel. 
Ultimately, Watt J. dismissed the application to set aside these two
authorizations.

 

                   The appellants also
brought a motion to quash O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s rulings and sought
prohibition in the Supreme Court of Ontario in order to prevent him from
admitting, in his capacity as trial judge, primary evidence obtained from the
seven impugned District Court authorizations.  This motion was heard and
dismissed by Watt J. on September 10, 1987:  R. v. Durette (1987), 61
O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126.  No appeal was taken from this decision.

 

                   The appellants
appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal inter alia in respect
of the validity of the wiretap authorizations and the admissibility and use of
the recordings intercepted pursuant thereto.  On May 15, 1992, the Court of
Appeal, Doherty J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal:  R. v. Durette 

(1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 557, 54 O.A.C. 81,
72 C.C.C. (3d) 421.  The appellants appeal to this Court as of right pursuant
to s. 691(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

II.Judgments Below

 

District Court (Judge O'Connell (Wilson
motion))

 

                   The trial judge
noted that he had edited the affidavits filed in support of the wiretap
authorizations granted by Scott Dist. Ct. J. before providing those affidavits
to defence counsel.  He stated that ""[t]he editing was undertaken to
protect sensitive information, and the names of the informants.""

 

                   The trial judge
reviewed a number of authorities, including Wilson v. The Queen, supra,
before concluding that, as a reviewing judge, he should not substitute his
discretion for that of the authorizing judge unless the facts on which the
authorizations were granted differed from the facts proved on the ex parte
review.  The trial judge also held that he was duty-bound to review the
unedited affidavits that were put before the authorizing judge, even though
defence counsel only had an edited version of those affidavits.  He stated,
""it seems to me impossible to review an affidavit and make a ruling as to
whether a judge would have granted an authorization based on an affidavit
without looking at that particular affidavit"".

 

                   After reviewing the
affidavits and the testimony of the affiants and two defence witnesses the
trial judge concluded:

 

It
cannot be said that there is proven negligence amounting to material
misrepresentation, material non‑disclosure, or that there is misleading
disclosure, fraud, or simply non‑disclosure as to important facts, any of
which would vitiate the authorizations.

 

                   The trial judge
added that he would have come to the same conclusion with respect to the edited
affidavits.  He found that there was a basis for the issuance of the authorizations
and that the affiants had reasonable and probable grounds to believe ""as
to what they deposed to by stating that all the matters deposed to were true to
the best of their knowledge and belief and were relevant as to the issue of
whether the judge would grant the authorization sought"".

 

Supreme Court of
Ontario (motion
before Watt J.) (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590

 

                   Watt J. emphasized
that he did not view resort to the supervisory jurisdiction of the superior
court as a substitute for the exercise of a statutory or other right of
appeal.  He made it clear that the only issue before him was whether the trial
judge had the jurisdiction to determine the matter argued before him on the
appellants' Wilson motion.

 

                   Watt J. held that
the test to be applied in reviewing the ruling of the trial judge was whether
there was some evidence upon which he could have been satisfied that there was
some evidence before Scott Dist. Ct. J. upon which the latter could have been
satisfied that there was compliance with the Criminal Code  provisions. 
Watt J. found that the ruling of the trial judge passed this test.  He also
found that the trial judge neither breached the rules of natural justice nor
exceeded his jurisdiction by limiting the scope of cross-examination of the
affiants, or determining whether sub-affiants could be cross-examined and
whether certain evidence should be received.  Accordingly, Watt J. dismissed
the appellants' motion to quash and accompanying application for prohibition.

 

Ontario Court of
Appeal (1992), 72
C.C.C. (3d) 421

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. (Brooke J.A. concurring)

 

                   Finlayson J.A.
dealt with the issue of the validity of the wiretap authorizations and the
admissibility and use of the taped recordings by considering the following
objections: (a) ""the failure to provide judicial summaries of edited
material"", (b) ""the improper editing of affidavits supporting
authorizations"", and (c) ""the refusal to permit examinations of
police officers who had provided information to deponents of affidavits
supporting authorizations"".  Referring to Garofoli, supra,
he stated that the court should determine ""whether what was done by the
trial judge fell so far short of the spirit of the procedural standard
suggested by Sopinka J. that we feel compelled to order a new trial"" (p.
447).

 

                   Finlayson J.A.
concluded that the appellants' case was not impaired by the trial judge's
failure to provide summaries.  He noted that the appellants had not requested
summaries and emphasized that the real issue was the editing process used by
the trial judge.  Finlayson J.A. pointed out that the trial judge had advised
counsel of the method he proposed to use in editing the affidavits and that
there had been no objections to the proposed procedure at that time. However,
Finlayson J.A. stated, ""[i]n light of the differences between the versions
of O'Connell J. and Watt J., who was in fact the author of Parmar, it is
hard to argue that the trial judge properly applied the principles of that
case"" (p. 449).  Finlayson J.A. noted that the trial judge's editing
accurately reflected his statements to counsel regarding how he would proceed.

 

                   Finlayson J.A. then
indicated that he had read all of the affidavits in their entirety.  He
described the excised information as ""nothing more than a further recital,
with specific examples, of how these biker gangs conducted their illegal drug
operations"" (p. 449).  He was of the view that there was ""an
abundance of evidence to support the original authorizations"" (p. 450).  
He went on to observe that he did not understand how the excised material could
have assisted the appellants in opposing the admissibility of the wiretap
evidence affecting them.

 

                   Finlayson J.A.
stated that the trial judge may have been ""over-cautious"" in his
editing but concluded that this did not amount to an error of law, or, if it
did, then it occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. 
Finlayson J.A. agreed with the trial judge that the authorizations should not
be set aside on the basis that ""all known targets were not named"" (p.
452).  He also pointed out that defence counsel already ""had a good
idea"" of what was contained in the affidavits since they had access to the
versions of the affidavits which had been edited by Watt J. and Bowlby J. 
Finlayson J.A. concluded (at p. 453):

 

                   On
balance, I do not think the appellants ... can show significant prejudice as a
result of the editing process.  In the absence of such prejudice, the failure
of the trial judge to fully anticipate guidelines that would be set down by
subsequent courts for editing affidavits is not sufficient, on appeal, to set
aside the authorizations in question.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. (dissenting)

 

                   Doherty J.A.,
relying on Stinchcombe, supra, stated that ""[f]ull
disclosure to the defence of all material information, subject to certain
exceptions based on overriding public interest concerns, is now a
constitutionally mandated standard"" (p. 466).  He held that affidavits
filed in support of a wiretap authorization are """"clearly
material"" to the admissibility of the interceptions"".  Doherty J.A.
concluded that disclosure of the full affidavit should be starting premise and
anything less potentially impairs an accused's ability to make full answer and
defence unless justified by the Crown ""in accordance with established
principles"".

 

                   Doherty J.A. then
stated that a deletion from an affidavit before it is disclosed to the defence
derogates from ""the goal of full public visibility of the administration
of criminal justice"" and ""potentially adversely affects public confidence
in our system of criminal justice"".  Therefore, a trial judge should
""make only those deletions which are essential to give effect to
confidentiality concerns that remain paramount as of the time the editing is
sought"" (p. 468).

 

                   Doherty J.A.
concluded that O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. failed to apply the principles set out in
Parmar, supra, in a number of respects (at pp. 471-73):  

 

                   First,
the trial judge edited the affidavits extensively without any input from the
Crown or any information beyond that which appeared in the affidavits.... 
[T]he trial judge should have called upon the Crown to justify the continued
need for confidentiality of those sources.  Without that inquiry, there could
be no valid assessment of what parts of the affidavit should be excised before
they were turned over to the accused.

 

                   Secondly,
the trial judge repeatedly indicated that he deleted ""information from
informants and others which is to be protected""....  The editing process
is intended to protect sources of information not the information from those
sources....  It appears that in editing the affidavits the trial judge sought
not only to protect the identity of informants, but to exclude from defence
scrutiny all information obtained from those informants.  In doing so, he took
much too broad an approach to the editing process.

 

                   Thirdly,
the trial judge indicated that he had edited out of the affidavits material
which he regarded as ""commentary"" or ""opinion"" or
""summary"".  Such characterizations have no role in the editing
process....  It may be that allegations properly characterized as
""commentary"" or ""opinion"" have no place in the affidavit. 
This is not, however, any reason to remove them from the affidavit during the
editing process.  Indeed, such comments may provide a fertile ground for
cross-examination of the affiant.

 

                   Fourthly,
the trial judge indicated that the editing of the same affidavits done by the
judge who presided over the earlier trial of the first group of accused was
""irrelevant"" to his editing task.... [I]t was very relevant.  The
ongoing need to preserve the confidentiality of information contained in the
affidavit is the only justification for deleting that information before
turning the affidavits over to the accused.  If that information is already in
the public domain by virtue of an earlier judicial proceeding, then
confidentiality can no longer be a legitimate concern. . . .

 

                   Fifthly
and finally, the editing of two of the affidavits by Watt J. in the course of a
""Wilson"" application brought during this trial provides cogent
evidence that the trial judge went well beyond what was required when editing
the affidavits.... One can only conclude from this comparison that the trial
judge went well beyond what was necessary to protect the public interest when
he edited the two affidavits which were subsequently placed before Watt J. 

 

                   The
trial record compels the conclusion that the trial judge misapplied the factors
relevant to the editing of the affidavits.  An examination of the unedited
affidavits which were made available to this court confirms that this
misapplication resulted in considerable unwarranted editing of the affidavits.

 

                   Doherty J.A. held
that the deletions kept from the appellants ""a substantial body of
material which they were entitled to have when mounting their challenge to the
admissibility of the intercepted communications"" (p. 476). 
Furthermore, the deletions prevented a proper and full inquiry into the
validity of the authorizations.  Therefore, he concluded that the trial judge
committed an error in law.  Doherty J.A. did not believe that the Crown had
established that the improper editing of the affidavits did not result in a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  He stated that there was simply
no way of knowing what might have come out on cross-examination if the
appellants had been given proper access to the material in the affidavits. 
Therefore, there was no way of establishing that if the affidavits had been
edited properly the impugned authorizations would have been upheld and that the
wiretap evidence obtained pursuant to those authorizations would have been
admissible against the appellants.

 

III.Relevant Legislation

 

                   Section 187  of the Criminal
Code  deals with the storage and removal of the material filed in support of
an application for a wiretap authorization.  At the time of the trial of this
matter s. 187  provided:

 

                   187. (1) All documents relating to an
application made pursuant to section 185 or subsection 186(6) or 196(2) are
confidential and, with the exception of the authorization, shall be placed in a
packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made immediately on
determination of the application, and that packet shall be kept in the custody
of the court in a place to which the public has no access or in such other
place as the judge may authorize and shall not be

 

                   (a) opened
or the contents thereof removed except

 

(i) for the purpose of dealing with an application for
renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii) pursuant to an order of a judge of a superior court
of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552; and

 

(b) destroyed except pursuant to an order of a judge
referred to in subparagraph (a)(ii).

 

                   (2) An order under subsection (1) may
only be made after the Attorney General or the Solicitor General by whom or on
whose authority the application was made for the authorization to which the
order relates has been given an opportunity to be heard.

 

                   This
provision was repealed by An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Crown
Liability and Proceedings Act  and the Radiocommunication Act, S.C. 1993, c.
40, s. 7 (Bill C-109), in force August 1, 1993.  The relevant portions of the
provision which replaced it are as follows:

 

                   187.  (1) All documents
relating to an application made pursuant to any provision of this Part are
confidential and, subject to subsection (1.1), shall be placed in a packet and
sealed by the judge to whom the application is made immediately on
determination of the application, and that packet shall be kept in the custody
of the court in a place to which the public has no access or in such other
place as the judge may authorize and shall not be dealt with except in
accordance with subsections (1.2) to (1.5).

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (1.3)  A provincial court judge, a
judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in
section 552 may order that the sealed packet be opened and its contents removed
for the purpose of copying and examining the documents contained in the packet.

 

                   (1.4)  A judge or provincial court
judge before whom a trial is to be held and who has jurisdiction in the
province in which an authorization was given may order that the sealed packet
be opened and its contents removed for the purpose of copying and examining the
documents contained in the packet if

 

(a) any matter relevant to the authorization or
any evidence obtained pursuant to the authorization is in issue in the trial;
and

 

(b) the accused applies for such an order for the
purpose of consulting the documents to prepare for trial.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (4) Where a prosecution has been
commenced and an accused applies for an order for the copying and examination
of documents pursuant to subsection (1.3) or (1.4), the judge shall not,
notwithstanding those subsections, provide any copy of any document to the
accused until the prosecutor has deleted any part of the copy of the document
that the prosecutor believes would be prejudicial to the public interest,
including any part that the prosecutor believes could

 

(a) compromise the identity of any confidential
informant;

 

(b) compromise the nature and extent of ongoing
investigations;

 

(c) endanger persons engaged in particular
intelligence-gathering techniques and thereby prejudice future investigations
in which similar techniques would be used; or

 

(d) prejudice the interests of innocent persons.

 

                   (5) After the prosecutor has deleted
the parts of the copy of the document to be given to the accused under
subsection (4), the accused shall be provided with an edited copy of the
document.

 

                   (6) After the accused has received an
edited copy of a document, the prosecutor shall keep a copy of the original
document, and an edited copy of the document and the original document shall be
returned to the packet and the packet resealed.

 

                   (7) An accused to whom an edited copy
of a document has been provided pursuant to subsection (5) may request that the
judge before whom the trial is to be held order that any part of the document
deleted by the prosecutor be made available to the accused, and the judge shall
order that a copy of any part that, in the opinion of the judge, is required in
order for the accused to make full answer and defence and for which the
provision of a judicial summary would not be sufficient, be made available to
the accused.

 

                   This
amended provision was not in force at any material time to the proceedings in
issue here and my reference to it is not intended to express any opinion with
respect to its interpretation.  It is, however, helpful as a legislative
comment on the principles stated in Garofoli, supra.

 

IV.Point in
Issue

 

                   The sole point in issue is:

 

Did the
Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in concluding that the trial judge's
editing of the affidavits in support of the wiretap authorizations did not
prevent a proper and full inquiry into the validity of the authorizations,
thereby depriving the appellants of the right to make full answer and defence?

 

V.Analysis

 

A.General
Principles

 

                   I
would allow the appeals substantially for the reasons delivered by Doherty J.A.
in the Court of Appeal.  Before explaining why I disagree with the decision of
the majority in the Court of Appeal, I will review some of the general
principles which apply to the disclosure of the contents of a wiretap affidavit
to an accused person. 

 

                   Under
s. 187, the material filed in support of an application for a wiretap
authorization is placed in a sealed packet to which the public normally has no
access.  That section, however, also permits the packet to be opened and the
contents removed pursuant to an order of a judge.  The judge hearing an
application under this section has a broad discretion to decide whether or not
to provide access to the packet.  However, in the case of an accused, that
discretion would not be exercised judicially or in conformity with the right
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to make full answer
and defence unless access was provided: Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General),
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505.  This is explicitly recognized in s. 187(5)  which now states
that the accused ""shall"" be given a copy of the material in the
packet once it has been edited by the prosecutor.

 

                   The
rule requiring that an accused automatically be given access to the sealed
packet is based upon the fact that, as part of the right to make full answer
and defence, the accused has the right to be given the opportunity to challenge
the admissibility of evidence tendered by the Crown.  The most effective way of
challenging the admissibility of wiretap evidence is to challenge the validity
of the authorizations pursuant to which that evidence was gathered.  If the
authorization is invalid then the admissibility of the wiretap evidence may be
challenged on both statutory and constitutional grounds.  The validity of a
wiretap authorization turns upon whether the affidavit put before the issuing
judge, as amplified by any evidence taken on review, provides a basis upon
which that judge could have been satisfied that the pre-conditions for granting
the authorization exist.  The validity of the authorization is heavily
dependent upon the contents of the affidavit.  Therefore, the accused must be
provided with access to the affidavit if he or she is to be given the
opportunity to mount an effective challenge to the admissibility of wiretap
evidence tendered by the Crown.  

 

                   In
Garofoli, I indicated that, in order to protect the public interest in
law enforcement, and in particular the interest in protecting the identity of
informers and the confidentiality of investigative techniques, a judge may edit
a wiretap affidavit before providing it to the accused.  The interests of law
enforcement are adequately served if the judge considers the factors set out in
Parmar, supra, at pp. 281-82, and approved of in Garofoli,
supra, at p. 1460, before disclosing the contents of an affidavit to the
accused.  Those factors are:

 

(a)whether the identities of confidential police informants,
and  consequently their lives and safety, may be compromised, bearing in mind
that such disclosure may occur as much by reference to the nature of the
information supplied by the confidential source as by the publication of his or
her name;

 

(b)whether the nature and extent of ongoing law
enforcement investigations would thereby be compromised;

 

(c)whether disclosure would reveal particular
intelligence‑gathering techniques thereby endangering those engaged
therein and prejudicing future investigation of similar offences and the public
interest in law enforcement and crime detection; and

 

(d)whether disclosure would prejudice the interests of
innocent persons.

 

                   This
aspect of the decision in Garofoli is now codified in s. 187(4)  of the Criminal
Code .

 

                   In
Garofoli, supra, at p. 1461, I also suggested that the following
procedure ought to be followed when disclosing the contents of wiretap
affidavits to the accused:

 

1.  Upon opening of the packet, if the Crown objects to
disclosure of any of the material, an application should be made by the Crown
suggesting the nature of the matters to be edited and the basis therefor.  Only
Crown counsel will have the affidavit at this point.

 

2.  The trial judge should then edit the affidavit as
proposed by Crown counsel and furnish a copy as edited to counsel for the
accused.  Submissions should then be entertained from counsel for the accused. 
If the trial judge is of the view that counsel for the accused will not be able
to appreciate the nature of the deletions from the submissions of Crown counsel
and the edited affidavit, a form of judicial summary as to the general nature
of the deletions should be provided.

 

3.  After hearing counsel for the accused and reply from
the Crown, the trial judge should make a final determination as to editing,
bearing in mind that editing is to be kept to a minimum and applying the
factors listed above.

 

4.  After the determination has been made in (3), the packet
material should be provided to the accused.

 

5.  If the Crown can support the authorization on the
basis of the material as edited, the authorization is confirmed.

 

6.  If, however, the editing renders the authorization
insupportable, then the Crown may apply to have the trial judge consider so
much of the excised material as is necessary to support the authorization.  The
trial judge should accede to such a request only if satisfied that the accused
is sufficiently aware of the nature of the excised material to challenge it in
argument or by evidence.  In this regard, a judicial summary of the excised
material should be provided if it will fulfil that function.  It goes without
saying that if the Crown is dissatisfied with the extent of disclosure and is
of the view that the public interest will be prejudiced, it can withdraw tender
of the wiretap evidence.

 

                   Two
of the essential features of the above procedure have now been codified in s.
187  of the Criminal Code .  First, s. 187(4) now makes it clear that
editing wiretap affidavits is primarily the responsibility of the prosecutor. 
This reflects the fact that only the prosecutor will be able to assess whether
there is an ongoing need to maintain the confidentiality of material contained
in wiretap affidavits.  In fact, in many cases it will be necessary for the
prosecutor to consult with the police in order to make this determination. 
Second, s. 187(7) recognizes the right of the defence to have an opportunity to
make submissions regarding the appropriateness of any proposed deletions.

 

                   In
Garofoli, supra, at pp. 1458 and 1460, I stated that during the
editing process, the judge must strike a balance between the competing
interests of law enforcement on the one hand, and the right of the accused to make
full answer and defence on the other.  I also stated at p. 1461 that editing is
to be kept to a minimum.  See also R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C.
(3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 43.   The present case provides a convenient
opportunity to add that the need for editing should not be presumed.

 

                   The
Charter  guarantee of the right to make full answer and defence requires
that, as a general rule, all relevant information in the possession of
the state be disclosed to an accused.  In order to justify non-disclosure the
Crown must bring itself within an exception to that general rule:  Stinchcombe,
supra, at pp. 340-41; and R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451, at
pp. 466-67.  This may be done by showing that the public interest in
non-disclosure outweighs the accused's interest in disclosure.  However, I
agree with the following statement by Doherty J.A., at p. 466:

 

Apart from public interest concerns which may operate in
a particular case, I see no reason why an accused should not be entitled to see
exactly what the judge saw who relied on the affidavits to issue the
authorization.  Disclosure of the full affidavit should be the starting
premise.  Anything less potentially impairs an accused's ability to make full
answer and defence and must be justified by the Crown in accordance with
established principles.  Editing of these affidavits is best viewed as a
necessary evil.

 

                   In
summary, when determining whether the contents of wiretap affidavits should be
disclosed to an accused, full disclosure should be the rule, subject only to
certain exceptions based upon overriding public interests which may justify
non-disclosure.  The affidavits should only be edited to the extent necessary
to protect those overriding public interests.

 

B.Application to the Present Case

 

                   1.Did the trial judge err in
adopting the procedure which he did?

 

                   The
trial judge was of the opinion that he had edited the affidavits in accordance
with the procedure suggested in the authorities put before him.  It is
difficult to determine on the basis of the record before this Court whether he
was justified in holding this view.

 

                   On
the one hand, the procedure adopted by the trial judge in this case was less
than ideal because he carried out the bulk of the editing before receiving any
information from the Crown regarding which material was confidential.  As
Doherty J.A. pointed out, the affidavits in question were sworn some three or
four years before the time of trial.  In addition, the police investigation was
completed before the trial.  Under the circumstances it is difficult to see how
the trial judge could have made an informed decision as to whether there was a
continuing need for confidentiality at the time of trial.  The procedure
adopted in the present case may also be faulted because the trial judge gave
defence counsel very little information about the nature of the proposed
deletions, beyond the statement that, in his view, all of the deletions could
be justified on the basis  of the factors set out in Parmar.  This
prevented the defence from making effective submissions regarding the
appropriateness of the proposed deletions.

 

                   On
the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the trial judge edited these
affidavits over three years before the decision in Garofoli was
rendered.  At that time one of the most authoritative cases regarding the
editing of wiretap affidavits was the decision of Watt J. in Parmar.  The
procedure followed by the trial judge was generally similar to the one adopted
by Watt J. in Parmar and subsequently approved of in Rowbotham, supra,
at p. 43.   It is also important to recall that the procedure set out in Garofoli
was not intended to be either exclusive or exhaustive.  Finally, it should be
noted that Crown did have some input during the editing process.  While reviewing
the judge's proposed deletions, the Crown consulted with a police officer and
in a few cases suggested that material deleted by the trial judge should be
disclosed to the accused.

 

                   In
light of the above it is difficult to determine whether or not the procedure
adopted by the trial judge fell so far short of the standard set in Garofoli
as to amount to an error of law.  I do not think that it is necessary to
express any opinion upon this point because of the conclusion which I reach
regarding whether the trial judge departed from the principles set out in Parmar
and subsequently approved of in Garofoli in determining what to edit.

 

                   2.Did
the trial judge err in determining what to edit?

 

                   The
respondent submitted with some force that the trial judge had complied with the
requirements of Parmar and therefore he should not be reversed just
because the rules changed after Parmar.  Without agreeing with the
premise of this submission that an error of law is excused if based on case law
that is later changed, I propose to address this submission in order to explain
why I agree with Doherty J.A. that the learned trial judge did not comply with Parmar.

 

                   In
my view the record clearly shows that the trial judge edited the affidavits before
him more extensively than was necessary to protect the public interest.  As
stated above, non-disclosure can only be justified on the basis that disclosure
will prejudice the interests of informants, innocent persons or the law
enforcement authorities and that such prejudice overbears the interests of the
accused.  If, however, the information has ceased to be confidential, then the
justification for non-disclosure disappears.  Here the trial judge was aware
that Bowlby J. had edited the same affidavits and could presume that this
version had become public at the trial before Bowlby J.  We are advised
that the trial judge edited out information that had not been edited by Bowlby
J. and therefore was public.  The trial judge considered that this was not
relevant.  With respect, this ignores the basic premise of non-disclosure, i.e.
that it is only confidential information that qualifies.  I agree with Doherty
J.A. that the affidavits as edited by Bowlby J. should have been the starting
point for the trial judge.

 

                   Furthermore,
the trial judge edited out material which in both the majority and minority
reasons is acknowledged not to relate to the identity of informers nor to any
of the other factors that justify non-disclosure.  In fact, in his comments to
counsel the trial judge suggested that he had excised not only information
which might tend to identify informants, but also information obtained from
informants and others.  This clearly was a departure from Parmar.  The
trial judge also departed from Parmar and erred in excising material
which he characterized as ""commentary"", ""summary"" or
""opinion"".

 

                   Trial
judges must be granted some discretion to determine what editing is required to
ensure that the public interest is protected.  However, that discretion does
not include the power to edit material whose continued confidentiality clearly
is not justified by any of the public interest concerns identified in Parmar. 
The fact that the same affidavits were edited by both Watt J. who wrote Parmar
and the trial judge and the fact that the latter made substantial deletions
while the former made almost no deletions indicates that there was more than a
difference in application of Parmar but the principles of Parmar
were not being applied.  One of those principles is that editing is to be kept
to a minimum: Parmar, supra, at p. 282.  This principle clearly
was not respected in the present case.

 

                   In
order to conclude that a failure to disclose information to the defence amounts
to a denial of the right to make full answer and defence, the court must
consider the nature of the information withheld and whether it might have
affected the outcome of the case:  Stinchcombe, supra, at p.
348.  Although he agreed that the trial judge had not complied with Parmar,
Finlayson J.A. concluded that he did not commit any error in law, or
alternatively, that any error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, because counsel for the appellants could not show that they were
significantly prejudiced by the trial judge's editing.  With respect, I think
that Finlayson J.A. erred in placing the onus upon the appellants to show how
the excised material might have been useful to their case.  As Doherty J.A.
stated at p. 477, in concluding that s. 686(1) (b)(iii) was
inapplicable:

 

                   It is particularly inappropriate to
place any onus on the appellants to demonstrate prejudice flowing from the
error revealed in this case.  The appellants have not seen the unedited
affidavits.  How can they be expected to show prejudice flowing from the
improper editing of those affidavits when they have no idea what information
was improperly kept from them?  Placing an onus on the appellants to
demonstrate prejudice from the denial of appropriate access to the affidavits
is akin to the now rejected contention that an accused had to show fraud before
she could obtain an order directing the opening of the sealed packet.  In both
cases the accused is placed in the untenable position of being denied access to
the very material which is crucial to demonstrating either prejudice or fraud.

 

                   In
my view, by showing that the trial judge excised a substantial amount of
material whose continued confidentiality could not be justified on the basis of
the factors set out in Parmar, the appellants have established, prima
facie, that their ability to make full answer and defence was prejudiced in
that they were denied the opportunity to conduct a full inquiry into the
validity of the seven wiretap authorizations challenged before the trial
judge.  The appellants should not be required to demonstrate the specific use
to which they might put information which they have not even seen.  The
respondent has not been able to satisfy me that no prejudice occurred and an
appellate court which does not have the benefit of access to counsel's brief
cannot be expected to speculate in these circumstances.  I must conclude,
therefore, that the ability of the appellants to make full answer and defence
was compromised.

 

                   The
respondent submits that regardless of whether the trial judge erred in editing
the affidavits, it is a complete answer to these appeals that each of the
affidavits as edited by the trial judge disclosed sufficient grounds to sustain
the relevant authorizations.  The respondent takes the position that there is
no need to consider the excised portions of the affidavit if the authorization
can be supported exclusively on the basis of the affidavit as edited.  However,
this submission ignores the fact that the material contained in the excised
material may be used to impugn the contents of the portions of the affidavit
which have been disclosed.  In the absence of overriding policy concerns which
justified confidentiality, the appellants were entitled to have the opportunity
to use the deleted material in this fashion.  As Doherty J.A. put it at
p. 478, ""[i]t may be that the appellants, armed with the deleted
information taken in combination with additional information which they may
have had, could have demonstrated the inaccuracy of allegations made in the
affidavits, or fraud, or culpable non-disclosure"".  

 

                   The
trial judge reviewed the material which had been deleted from the affidavits in
the course of assessing the validity of the authorizations.  In doing so he
presumably considered whether any of that material detracted from the contents
of the portions of the affidavits which were disclosed.  However, this judicial
screening of the material which was improperly withheld from the appellants did
not cure the failure to make proper disclosure.  The trial judge did not have
access to the same information as the defence.  The fact that the trial judge
may not have seen how the excised material could have assisted the appellants
does not necessarily mean that defence counsel would not have found a way to
use that material to their advantage.

 

                   3.Is
Section 686(1)(b)(iii) applicable?

 

                   This
is not an appropriate case in which to apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .  The wiretap evidence obtained pursuant to the impugned authorizations
formed a substantial part of the evidence against the appellants.  The fact
that the appellants were deprived of the right to make full answer and defence
when challenging the admissibility of that evidence necessarily means that a
new trial must be ordered.  It is impossible to say that the verdicts against
the appellants would necessarily have been the same if the defence had
succeeded in establishing that even one of the impugned authorizations was
invalid.

 

                   The
respondent submits that each of the impugned affidavits should be examined
individually to determine whether any over-editing occurred and the Court
should examine the packets and original unedited affidavits to determine the
extent to which the appellants are specifically named or dealt with in the
excised material.  The respondent adds that, if over-editing is found in a
particular affidavit, to the extent that it can be said that the trial judge
failed to act judicially, the Court must determine whether any conversations
were intercepted pursuant to the relevant authorization and if so, whether any
of those calls were incriminating.

 

                   There
are a number of reasons why the respondent's submission must be rejected. 
First, if any authorizations were set aside by this Court on the grounds that
the appellants were not afforded a proper opportunity to test their validity,
the validity of subsequent authorizations would be placed in doubt to the
extent that they were issued on the basis of evidence obtained pursuant to the
invalidated authorizations.  Second, even though the appellants were not
directly incriminated by the conversations recorded pursuant to some of the
authorizations, incriminating remarks made by other individuals during those
conversations were admitted as evidence against the appellants under the
co-conspirator's exception to the rule against hearsay.  Third, if any of the wiretap
evidence had been declared inadmissible, an unknown portion of the other
evidence against the appellants may have been rendered inadmissible as
derivative evidence.  The combined effect of these factors makes it impossible
to conclude that the verdicts entered against the appellants would necessarily
have been the same if they had succeeded in challenging the validity of one or
more of the wiretap authorizations.

 

VI.Conclusion

 

                   Under
the circumstances, I am compelled to conclude that the trial judge erred in law
by editing the affidavits in such a way that the appellants were denied the
right to make full answer and defence.  This error cannot be cured by the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii).  I therefore agree with Doherty J.A.
that the appeals must be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial
ordered.

 

                   The
reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé J.
(dissenting) -- These appeals concern judge-made legal rules which governed
legally authorized wiretapping of telephone conversations.  The legislative
provision at the heart of these cases is s. 178.14(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (enacted by the Protection of Privacy Act,
S.C. 1973-74, c. 50, s. 2), which read at the time:

 

                   178.14 (1)  All documents
relating to an application made pursuant to section 178.12 or subsection
178.13(3) or 178.23(3) are confidential and, with the exception of the
authorization, shall be placed in a packet and sealed by the judge to
whom the application is made immediately upon determination of such
application, and such packet shall be kept in the custody of the court in a
place to which the public has no access or in such other place as the judge may
authorize and shall not be

 

(a) opened or the contents thereof removed
except

 

(i) for the purpose of dealing with an application for
renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii) pursuant to an order of a judge of a superior
court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 482;
[Emphasis added.]

                   (Later R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 187 
(as am. by c. 27 (1st Supp.), 

                          s.
24).)

 

                   We
are concerned here with subpara. (ii).  The appellants sought the opening of
the sealed packets containing the evidence.  Those, in the form of affidavits,
were submitted to a judge for the purpose of authorizing the wiretap of the
appellants' and others' telephone conversations in the course of an
investigation of a drug traffic conspiracy.  Although that motion was granted
and cross-examination of the affiants and two additional witnesses was allowed
on a Wilson review application (Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2
S.C.R. 594), the wiretapped conversations were found to be admissible at trial
and were admitted in evidence.  Further application in the form of certiorari
was denied.  The appellants, Leonard Farinacci and Yves Lépine were convicted
of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine and the appellant Kenneth Jeffreys
was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  Their appeals to the
Ontario Court of Appeal were dismissed by a majority: R. v. Durette
(1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 557, 54 O.A.C. 81, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421.  They come before us
as of right.  My colleague Sopinka J. would allow the appeals.  I dissent
and would dismiss the appeals for the following reasons.

 

                   Before
discussing the issues raised in these appeals, it is relevant to set out at
some length the proceedings which gave rise to the appeals as well as the
judgments below.

Facts
and Proceedings

 

                   The
charges against the appellants were part of many laid against members of two
motorcycle clubs, the Iron Hawgs and the Outlaws.  In the summer of 1983, the
Metropolitan Toronto Police Force had commenced an investigation into the
distribution of illicit drugs by members of the Iron Hawgs (Project Boar).  In
the spring of 1984, the Metropolitan Toronto Police obtained two authorizations
to intercept private communications from the Supreme Court of Ontario (March 1,
1984, before Trainor J. (Exhibit 3) and April 14, 1984, before Ewaschuk J.
(Exhibit 5)).  During approximately the same period, the Niagara Regional
Police and the Ontario Provincial Police had commenced a parallel investigation
into the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs (Project Skylab). 
Police officers obtained six authorizations to intercept private communications
from Judge Scott of the Ontario District Court of Niagara covering the period
between November 1983 and August 1984 (November 16, 1983 (Exhibit 1); January
12, 1984 (Exhibit 2); March 9, 1984 (Exhibit 4); May 7, 1984 (Exhibit 6); June
11, 1984 (Exhibit 7); and July 9, 1984 (Exhibit 8)).

 

                   In
August 1984, the two separate police investigations merged because the two
targeted clubs had amalgamated.  Officers involved in the combined
investigations obtained three further authorizations to intercept private
communications from Judge Scott of the Ontario District Court covering the
period between August 1984 and January 1985 (only one was presented at the
trial (Exhibit 9).  There were therefore a total of eleven authorizations: nine
from the District Court and two from the Supreme Court of Ontario.  They
covered a period from November 1983 to January 1985.

 

                   As
a result of these police investigations and wiretapping, about 80 persons were
arrested on January 22, 1985, at nine different Outlaws clubhouses in Ontario
and Québec, as well as numerous private residences.  The three appellants were
among the persons arrested.  Charges against 61 Ontario accused were laid under
a single information alleging conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine, cocaine
and LSD.  A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 2, 1985.

 

                   On
November 19, 1985, the Attorney General of Canada preferred two indictments,
replacing the original information and cancelling the preliminary hearing.  One
indictment, presented in the Supreme Court of Ontario, named 12 accused.  The
other, presented in the Ontario District Court, named 27 accused, including the
three appellants.  Since these trials are interrelated as far as the wiretap
authorizations are concerned, it is necessary to refer to them.

 

Supreme
Court of Ontario Trial (R. v. Marsh, unreported)

 

                   In
the case of 12 accused, the trial began on June 2, 1986 before Bowlby J.  On
June 24, 1986, Bowlby J. granted an application to open the nine sealed packets
(seven District Court and two Supreme Court of Ontario authorizations).  Bowlby
J. permitted access by the defence to the affidavits.  After Bowlby J. edited
the affidavits, released them to defence counsel and permitted extensive
cross-examinations of the three affiants by the defence, he ruled on the Wilson
application brought by the accused, upholding the validity of the nine
authorizations (September 30, 1986).

 

                   Of
the 12 persons indicted, nine entered pleas of guilty before or during the
trial, in one case the charges were stayed and the two other accused were
convicted, on February 27, 1987.  There were no appeals against convictions. 
As the Supreme Court trial was over, a date for the District Court trial was
set for May 11, 1987.

 

District
Court Trial

 

                   The
District Court trial commenced on May 11, 1987 before Judge O'Connell.  From
May 11 until June 24, 1987, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. entertained the following
pre-trial motions:

 

(i) a motion to stay the proceedings on the basis of
unreasonable delay;

 

(ii) a motion to quash the indictments on the basis that
s. 507  of the Criminal Code  was inconsistent with ss. 7 , 9 , 12  and 15  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ;

 

(iii) a motion to have separate trials;

 

(iv) a motion to sever the trial on the counts;

 

(v) a motion to change the venue of the trial;

 

(vi) a motion to open the seven sealed packets
containing the affidavits sworn in support of applications to obtain
authorizations to intercept private communications; and

 

(vii) a Wilson motion, to quash the seven
District Court authorizations to intercept private communications.

 

                   It
is the disposition of the two latter applications which is relevant to the
present appeals.

                   

                   On
May 13, 1987, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. granted the application to open the
packets and gave the appellants access to nine sealed packets (although seven
were asked for, including the two Supreme Court of Ontario authorizations)
containing the affidavits, subject to the packets being judicially edited. 
O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did not require the appellants to establish a prima
facie case of fraud or any other preconditions in order to obtain access to
the sealed packets.  On May 15, 1987, after O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. opened the
nine sealed packets, removed the affidavits and edited them himself according
to R. v. Parmar (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (Ont. H.C., Watt J.) (""Parmar
(No. 1)"") and gave a copy of the nine edited affidavits to the Crown
for review.  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. then proceeded to review each affidavit
with Crown counsel, identifying each of the deletions which he had made and
seeking the Crown's submissions.  The appellants' counsel were present
throughout this exercise.

 

                   It
is acknowledged that O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. made more extensive deletions to
the nine affidavits than Bowlby J. had in the Supreme Court trial in R. v.
Marsh.

 

                   O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J. released edited copies of the nine affidavits to the appellants
and heard submissions from the appellants' counsel over the course of two days
with respect to his editing (May 19 and 20, 1987).  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did
not accede to the appellants' requests for more information as to the content
of the affidavits, although he did inform them as to whether they were named in
the deleted portions of the affidavits and proceeded to list those accused in
the deleted portions of the nine affidavits.  The trial judge said that he
deleted information relating to informers on the basis that it would reveal
their identity, based on Parmar (No. 1), and he also deleted minor
improper or irrelevant commentaries.  He refused to consider the extent to
which Bowlby J. has edited the same affidavits in the course of the Wilson
hearing of September 30, 1986 in R. v. Marsh.

 

                   The
appellants then cross-examined the three affiants (Edward Typer, Walter Baker
and James Douglas Wilkinson) for nine full days (May 21, 22, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29 and June 1, 2, 1987).  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. granted permission to
cross-examine without requiring the appellants to satisfy any of the threshold
tests set out in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), and R. v.
Parmar (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. H.C., Watt J.), aff'd (1989), 53
C.C.C. (3d) 489 (Ont. C.A.).

 

                   On
June 5, 1987, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. ruled on a voir dire that the
appellants could not cross-examine the ""sub-affiants"" who supplied
the information to the affiants.  Notwithstanding his ruling on the voir
dire, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. granted the appellants' request to call two
additional witnesses.  Constables Robert Lines and William Murray were
cross-examined for three days (June 7, 8 and 9, 1987).

 

                   On
June 15, 1987, the appellants filed a Wilson application to set aside
the seven District Court authorizations.  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. dismissed the
application on June 24, 1987 and ruled that the interceptions were lawfully
made and the intercepted communications were admissible in evidence against the
appellants and their co-accused.

 

                   The
appellants then brought a motion in the nature of a certiorari, before
the Supreme Court of Ontario (Watt J.), to set aside O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s
decision on the appellants' Wilson application, challenging the wiretap
authorizations on the sole ground that the trial judge edited too much of the
affidavits provided to the judge who authorized the wiretaps.  On September 10,
1987, this application was dismissed by Watt J.: R. v. Durette (1987),
61 O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126.  According to Watt J., O'Connell Dist.
Ct. J. did not err in finding that the edited affidavits set out probable and
reasonable grounds sufficient to support the issuance of the authorizations neither
did he exceed his jurisdiction nor breach the rules of natural justice in
limiting the scope of the cross-examination, determining whether certain
persons should be cross-examined and whether certain evidence sought to be
admitted ought to be received as relevant.

 

                   Concurrently,
in September 1987, a second Wilson motion was presented before
Watt J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario in order to set aside the two Supreme
Court of Ontario authorizations.  The motion was dismissed by Watt J. 
Watt J. re-edited the affidavits of Dennis Pearce dated March 1 and
April 14, 1984 (which were Exhibits 8A and 9A before O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J.) and distributed the edited affidavits to the appellants.  He made less
deletions to the affidavits than those made by O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.  The
appellants had the opportunity to cross-examine the affiant, Dennis Pearce, at
length on his affidavits.  No appeal was taken of Watt J.'s decision.

 

                   The
trial before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. finally resumed.   After the jury was selected
in October 1987, the trial effectively commenced on November 16, 1987.  Between
November 19, 1987 and April 18, 1988, the Crown called 98 witnesses, tendered
98 exhibits and played approximately 600 tape recordings of private intercepted
communications.   Between April 19, 1988 and May 9, 1988, the defence (the
appellants) called 30 witnesses and tendered 27 exhibits.  The address to the
jury by counsel lasted eight days (May 16-19 and 24-27, 1988).  O'Connell Dist.
Ct. J. made his charge to the jury on May 30, and June 1 and 2, 1988.

 

                   After
10 days of deliberation, the jury rendered its verdict on June 11, 1988.  Of
the 27 persons originally indicted in the District Court, seven had their
charges stayed by the court at the request of the Crown before, during or after
the conclusion of the trial; 13 entered pleas of guilty before or during the
trial; six were convicted (including the three appellants and Rawley Durette)
and one was acquitted.   Those convicted were sentenced in June and July 1988.

 

                   In
June and December 1988, the three appellants and the co-accused Rawley Durette
filed a notice of appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, appealing their
convictions and sentences.  The appellants' and Rawley Durette's appeals were
dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on May 15, 1992 (Brooke and Finlayson
JJ.A. for the majority, Doherty J.A. dissenting).  Based on that dissent, the
appellants appealed their convictions to this Court as of right, while Rawley
Durette did not.

 

                   Appellants'
application for leave to appeal on other issues was dismissed by this Court on
March 18, 1993, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vi.

 

Judgments

 

Ontario
District Court (first Wilson application before Judge
O'Connell)

 

                   O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J. said that, after editing the affidavits in accordance with Parmar
(No. 1), supra, he had ordered disclosure or access to the sealed
packets containing the materials which Judge Scott of the Ontario District
Court of Niagara relied on to grant the authorizations.  He then stated that
the ""editing was undertaken to protect sensitive information, and the
names of the informants"".

 

                   O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J. considered the constitutionality of Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now Part VI of R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ).  After
reviewing Parmar (No. 1), he concluded that, in determining whether the
facts revealed to the authorizing judge should be different from the facts
proven on the review application, the former were the facts displayed in the
original rather than the edited affidavit disclosed to the defence counsel; the
reviewing judge should consider the non-edited affidavits.  He also was of the
opinion that the onus upon such an application rested upon the applicants and
that the onus is discharged on adequate proof of, inter alia, fraudulent
misrepresentation, intentional non-disclosure, negligent material
misrepresentation or misleading disclosures.  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. further
held that the factual material disclosed to the authorizing judge must be
sufficient.

 

                   O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J. reviewed the evidence, that is the testimony of the affiants and
the witnesses and the affidavits, and concluded that:

 

It cannot be said that there is proven negligence
amounting to material misrepresentation, material non‑disclosure, or that
there is misleading disclosure, fraud, or simply non‑disclosure as to
important facts, any of which would vitiate the authorizations.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Furthermore,
O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. applied the test set out in Wilson v. The Queen, supra,
and concluded that, as a reviewing judge, he should not substitute his
discretion for that of the authorizing judge unless the facts on which the
authorizations were granted differed from the facts proved on the ex parte
review.  O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. then concluded that:

 

...  it is my view that I am duty‑bound to review
the affidavit which was put before the authorizing judge, notwithstanding that
counsel for the applicants do not have a copy of that affidavit; they having
been supplied with an edited copy....  [I]t seems to me impossible to review an
affidavit and make a ruling as to whether a judge would have granted an
authorization based on an affidavit without looking at that particular
affidavit.  I appreciate the issue that it raises ... but I believe, if I read Wilson
correctly, that that is evidence under review, notwithstanding the editing.

 

                   O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J. added that he would have come to the same conclusion with respect
to the edited affidavit.  He was of the opinion that there was a basis for the issuance
of the authorizations and that

 

the affiants had reasonable and probable grounds to
believe as to what they deposed to by stating that all the matters deposed to
were true to the best of their knowledge and belief and were relevant as to the
issue of whether the judge would grant the authorization sought.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The
application to quash the authorizations was therefore dismissed by O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J.

 

Supreme
Court of Ontario (motion in the nature of certiorari before Watt
J.) (1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590

 

                   Watt
J. held that the test to be applied on an application by way of certiorari
is whether there was some evidence upon which the reviewing judge could have
been satisfied that there was some evidence before the authorizing judge upon
which he could have been satisfied that there was compliance with the Criminal
Code  provisions.  Further, rulings of an evidentiary nature made in the
course of the review hearing are not subject to review by the superior court
unless they result in errors of a jurisdictional nature.

 

                   On
the point of whether or not the facts proved on the review hearing were
different from the facts before the authorizing judge (Scott Dist. Ct. J.) and
O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s view that he was required to have regard to the
unedited affidavit notwithstanding that it had not been disclosed in full to
defence counsel, Watt J. found that O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s decision did not
constitute a jurisdictional error.

 

                   Similarly,
Watt J. held that O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. was entitled to make rulings as to the
scope of cross-examination of the affiants and entitled to hold that a person
who had supplied the information to the affiants (a ""sub-affiant"")
could not be cross-examined.  It was plainly within O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s
authority to limit the scope of cross-examination, to determine whether certain
persons should be cross-examined and whether certain evidence sought to be
admitted ought to be received as relevant.  In making these determinations, in
his view, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did not exceed his jurisdiction nor breach the
rules of natural justice.

 

                   Finally,
Watt J. concluded, at p. 603:

 

Neither am I persuaded that there was not some evidence
upon the basis of which the reviewing judge [O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.] could have
been satisfied that there was some evidence before the learned authorizing
judge [Scott Dist. Ct. J.] upon which he could have been satisfied of the
necessary prerequisites of Part IV.1 to issue the impugned orders.
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Watt
J. dismissed the motion in the nature of certiorari.

 

Ontario
Court of Appeal (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421 

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. (Brooke J.A. concurring)

 

                   Finlayson
J.A., writing for the majority, dealt with the issue of the validity of the
authorizations to intercept private communications and the admissibility and
use of the taped recordings and dismissed the appellants' submissions as to:
(1) the failure of the trial judge to provide judicial summaries of edited
material; (2) his improper editing of affidavits supporting the wiretap
authorizations; and (3) his refusal to permit cross-examination of police
officers who had provided information to deponents of affidavits supporting
authorizations.

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. examined the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Garofoli,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, and concluded that ""all questions relating to
wiretaps can and should be dealt with by the trial judge.  He is obliged to
consider them along with any other issue relating to the reception of
evidence"" (p. 445).  Therefore, the issues were whether the wiretaps were
authorized by law and were carried out according to the terms of the
authorizations.  Finlayson J.A., then, noted that the problem in wiretap cases
was that the material supporting the authorizations is in a sealed packet which
can only be opened by a judge, and when the packet is opened, only an edited
version of the material is made available to the defence.  However, Finlayson
J.A., relying on Garofoli, which followed Parmar (No.1), supra,
said that the court should determine ""whether what was done by the trial
judge fell so far short of the spirit of the procedural standard suggested by
Sopinka J. [in Garofoli] that we feel compelled to order a new
trial"" (p. 447).

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. concluded that the appellants' case was not impaired by O'Connell Dist.
Ct. J.'s failure to provide summaries.  He noted that the appellants had not
requested summaries and emphasized that the real issue was the editing process
undertaken by O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.  He pointed out that O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J. had advised counsel of the method he was using in editing the affidavits and
that there had been no objections to the proposed procedure.  He noted that the
differences between the edited versions of the affidavits by O'Connell Dist.
Ct. J. as compared by Watt J. lead to the conclusion that O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J. had not followed to the letter the guidelines proposed by Watt J. in  Parmar
(No.1).  Finlayson J.A. nevertheless concluded that (at pp. 449-50):

 

                   On the other hand, the information
excised [from the affidavits], while substantial in terms of quantity, is
nothing more than a further recital, with specific examples, of how these biker
gangs conducted their illegal drug operations.... In one sense, the edited
material adds nothing to what is on the public record at trial....  I am
satisfied that there was an abundance of evidence to support the original
authorizations.  In looking at all of the excised material in isolation, I am
at a loss to understand how it could have assisted these appellants at trial in
effectively opposing the admissibility of the wiretap evidence affecting them.

 

                   My own view is that the trial judge
was over-cautious in his attempts to protect the identity of the
informants and the nature of the undercover operation.  I also question whether
he should have deleted matters that he felt constituted improper or irrelevant
commentary.  That is but one opinion, however, and is not enough to override
that of an experienced trial judge.

 

                   Therefore, I do not think
O'Connell J.'s editing amounted to an error of law.  If his decision is such an
error, then in my opinion it occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. then agreed with O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. that the authorizations should not
be set aside on the basis that all known targets were not named and that the
outcome on this issue would not have changed had the defence been provided with
the edited material.  Finlayson J.A. also thought that the silence of defence
counsel before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. regarding the edited affidavits of Bowlby
J. lead to the conclusion that the editing of Bowlby J. was either similar to
that of O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. or that what was revealed by comparing the two
edited versions was not significant.

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. concluded that (at p. 453):

 

                   On balance, I do not think the
appellants Farinacci, Lépine and Jeffreys can show significant prejudice as a
result of the editing process.  In the absence of such prejudice, the failure
of the trial judge to fully anticipate guidelines that would be set down by
subsequent courts for editing affidavits is not sufficient, on appeal, to set
aside the authorizations in question.

 

                   Finlayson
J.A. stated that, even after cross‑examination of the affiants, the
defence had been unable to make out a case, to the satisfaction of O'Connell
Dist. Ct. J., and then noted that defence counsel had not cross‑examined
the sub‑affiants that did testify and concluded that O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J.'s view was correct in not allowing another trial simply on the Wilson
application.

 

                   Finlayson
J.A.'s final conclusion was that the trial judge was right in holding that the
authorizations to intercept private communications were valid, expressing the
view that the appellants ""received anything less than a fair trial""
(p. 456).  He dismissed the appeals against convictions as well as against
sentences.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. (dissenting)

 

                   Doherty
J.A., relying on the decision of our Court R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 326, stated that full disclosure to the defence of all material
information, subject to certain exceptions based on overriding public interest
concerns, was a constitutionally mandated standard.  The affidavits were, in
his view, ""clearly material"" to the admissibility of the
interceptions and concluded that (at p. 466):

 

Apart from public interest concerns which may operate in
a particular case, I see no reason why an accused should not be entitled to see
exactly what the judge saw who relied on the affidavits to issue the
authorization.  Disclosure of the full affidavit should be the starting
premise.  Anything less potentially impairs an accused's ability to make full
answer and defence and must be justified by the Crown in accordance with
established principles.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. then went on to say that a deletion from an affidavit before it was
disclosed to the defence derogated from the goal of full public visibility of
the administration of criminal justice and potentially adversely affects public
confidence in our system of criminal justice.  Therefore, a trial judge should
make only those deletions which are essential to give effect to confidentiality
concerns that remain paramount as of the time the editing is sought.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. concluded that O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did not correctly apply the
principles set out in Parmar (No.1), supra, for the following
reasons (at pp. 471-73):

 

                   First, the trial judge edited the
affidavits extensively without any input from the Crown or any information
beyond that which appeared in the affidavits....  [T]he trial judge should have
called upon the Crown to justify the continued need for confidentiality of
those sources.  Without that inquiry, there could be no valid assessment of
what parts of the affidavit should be excised before they were turned over to
the accused.

                                                                     

                   Secondly, the trial judge repeatedly
indicated that he deleted ""information from informants and others which is
to be protected"".... 

It appears that in editing the affidavits the trial
judge sought not only to protect the identity of informants, but to exclude
from defence scrutiny all information obtained from those informants.  In doing
so, he took much too broad an approach to the editing process.

 

                   Thirdly, the trial judge indicated
that he had edited out of the affidavits material which he regarded as
""commentary"" or ""opinion"" or ""summary"".  Such
characterizations have no role in the editing process....  It may be that
allegations properly characterized as ""commentary"" or
""opinion"" have no place in the affidavit.  This is not, however, any
reason to remove them from the affidavit during the editing process....  

 

                   Fourthly, the trial judge indicated
that the editing of the same affidavits done by the judge [Bowlby J.] who
presided over the earlier trial of the first group of accused was
""irrelevant"" to his editing task.  With respect, it was very
relevant....  [T]he trial judge's failure to appreciate the significance of the
earlier editing process to his task further confirms my view that he
misunderstood and misapplied the factors relevant to the editing of the
affidavits.

 

                   Fifthly and finally, the editing of
two of the affidavits by Watt J. in the course of a ""Wilson""
application brought during this trial provides cogent evidence that the trial
judge went well beyond what was required when editing the affidavits....  One
can only conclude from this comparison that the trial judge went well beyond what
was necessary to protect the public interest when he edited the two affidavits
which were subsequently placed before Watt J.

 

                   The trial record compels the
conclusion that the trial judge misapplied the factors relevant to the editing
of the affidavits.  An examination of the unedited affidavits which were made
available to this court confirms that this misapplication resulted in
considerable unwarranted editing of the affidavits.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. concluded that the deletions kept from the appellants a substantial body
of material which they were entitled to have when mounting their challenge to
the admissibility of the intercepted communications.   It was not simply a case
of over-cautiousness from the trial judge.  Furthermore, since the deletions
prevented a proper and full inquiry into the validity of the authorizations,
the appellants did establish an error in law.

 

                   In
view of this error of law, the onus was on the Crown to establish that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred, according to Doherty
J.A.  There was no onus on the appellants to show that the error prejudiced
them at the trial.  Doherty J.A. concluded that (at p. 479):

 

                   In my opinion, the Crown cannot
establish that the improper editing of the affidavits resulted in no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  It cannot be concluded with any
degree of certainty that had the appellants had proper access to all of the
material in the affidavits, the authorizations would necessarily have been held
valid and the ""wiretap"" evidence admissible.  There is simply no way
of knowing what further evidence might have come out on the cross‑examination
of the affiants had the entire affidavits been available, what further evidence
might have been adduced had the appellants been aware of the improperly edited
portions of the affidavits, or what different challenges to the authorizations
the appellants may have made had they received the access to the affidavits to which
they were entitled.

 

                   Doherty
J.A. would have allowed the appeals, quashed the convictions and ordered a new
trial.

 

The
Issue

 

                   The
only issue before this Court is whether the editing by the trial judge of the
affidavits in support of the authorizations to intercept private communications
deprived the appellants of their right to make full answer and defence as
guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .  In other words, did the editing process followed by the trial judge
constitute an error of law and, if so, did such error violate appellants' Charter 
rights?

 

                   It
is important to note at this stage that, at the hearing before us, counsel for
the appellants recognized that had the affidavits submitted to the judge in order
to obtain the wiretap authorizations contained only the edited
affidavits, such affidavits would have been sufficient for the issuing of the
authorizations since, in his words, ""there appear to be reasonable and
probable grounds"" (Transcript of Audio Tapes of Proceedings, at p. 136). 
Therefore, in my view, wiretap evidence was admissible at trial and,
consequently, properly admitted.

 

                   Finally,
before dealing with the crux of the appeals, it is not without interest to
recall the jurisprudential history which has led to the development of the
procedural requirements in the field of wiretap authorizations.

 

                                                                 -
II -

 

                   In
adopting s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code , the legislator
did not indicate the basis upon which the sealed packet were to be opened,
simply stating that it ""shall not be (a) opened ...  except (ii)
pursuant to an order of a judge ... "".  It left the courts with the task
of deciding the proper approach to the matter.  That was done not without sharp
division between different courts, particularly between the Ontario Court of
Appeal and the British Columbia Court of Appeal, with both courts having their
own adepts, creating a huge body of contradictory jurisprudence in courts of
first instance and fostering a number of appeals which finally reached the
Supreme Court of Canada.

 

                   The
two approaches were based on a divergent interpretation of s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii). 
For the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Re Regina and Dersch (1987),
36 C.C.C. (3d) 435), the rule embodied in that section being the secrecy of the
sealed packet, the exception had to be interpreted narrowly.  For the Ontario
Court of Appeal (R. v. Playford (1987), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142; R. v.
Lachance (1988), 27 O.A.C. 45; R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C.
(3d) 1; and R. v. Garofoli (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97), the principle of
openness set out in Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982]
1 S.C.R. 175, a pre-Charter decision regarding the public's right of
access to search warrants, was the starting point.  The Supreme Court embraced
the latter point of view (Garofoli, supra; R. v. Lachance,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1490; Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2
S.C.R. 1505; and R. v. Zito, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1520).

 

                   The
foundations of this whole jurisprudence, however, were laid much earlier and it
is my view that when s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code  was
adopted in 1974, Parliament was entitled to rely on what was settled law at the
time.

 

                   From
time immemorial in the common law and under the Criminal Code , once a
justice had authorized the issuance of a warrant, that authorization could not
be challenged (see: Poje v. Attorney General for British Columbia,
[1953] 1 S.C.R. 516, aff'g sub nom. Canadian Transport (U.K.) Ltd. v.
Alsbury, [1953] 1 D.L.R. 385 (B.C.C.A.),  and authorities referred to in
judgments of the majority at pp. 406 and 418-19; Maynard v. Maynard,
[1951] S.C.R. 346; Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin, [1909] A.C. 615
(P.C.); and Gibson v. Le Temps Publishing Co. (1903), 6 O.L.R. 690
(C.A.), at pp. 694-95).

 

                   McIntyre
J. held in Wilson v. The Queen, supra, at p. 604:

 

                   The cases cited above and the
authorities referred to therein confirm the well-established and fundamentally
important rule, relied on in the case at bar in the Manitoba Court of Appeal,
that an order of a court which has not been set aside or varied on appeal
may not be collaterally attacked and must receive full effect according to its
terms.

 

                   The authorizations in question here
are all orders of a superior court.  Unless Parliament has altered or varied
the rule above-described, it would apply in this case.  It would then follow
that in this action to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused the
trial judge was in error in entertaining a collateral attack on the validity of
the authorizations and, in effect, going behind them.  Support for this view,
with some qualifications for cases where there has been a defect on the face of
the authorization or fraud, is to be found in R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No.
6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), where Zuber J.A., at pp. 371-72,
said:

 

                   Ordinarily the trial Court is
obliged to simply accept the authorization at face value.  Cases in which a
trial Court could decline to accept the authorization would be rare indeed
and, without attempting to set out an exhaustive list, would include cases in
which the authorization was defective on its face, or was vitiated by reason of
having been obtained by a fraud.  However, even an authorization that was said
to be defective on its face may attract the curative provisions of s.
178.16(2)(b).... [Emphasis added.]

 

                   He
then said, at p. 605:

 

                   The question then is: has Parliament
by the enactment of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code  altered the rule
which would render the authorizations immune from collateral attack?  In my
opinion, the answer must be no.

 

                   McIntyre
J. relied upon R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d)
363 (Ont. C.A.), in which Zuber J.A. also stated, at p. 371:

 

The authorization, once given, enables the authorities
to proceed to a lawful interception [of private communications].  A second
consideration of the adequacy of the material supporting the authorization by
the trial Judge, for the purpose of determining retrospectively whether or not
the interception was lawful, is inconsistent with the whole scheme of Part IV.1
of the Code. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Wilson
v. The Queen, supra, was unanimously re-affirmed by this
Court in R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764: an authorization which has
not been set aside is not subject to collateral attack and must be given full
effect according to its terms.

 

                   Before
the advent of the Charter , once an authorization to intercept private
communications was given and appeared on its face to be valid, no further
search into its confidential materials could be done, except in rare and
exceptional circumstances (Re Royal Commission Inquiry into the Activities
of Royal American Shows Inc. (No. 3) (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 212 (Alta.
S.C.T.D.), at p. 220).  Rare and exceptional circumstances were found to occur
where the authorization was obtained by fraud, non-disclosure or for an
unlawful purpose or where a man's innocence was directly at stake (Re
Miller and Thomas and The Queen (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (B.C.S.C.)), or
where the evidence was not compatible with the face of the authorization (R.
v. Cheng (1976), 33 C.C.C.  (2d) 441 (B.C. Co. Ct.), at p. 444; R. v.
Madden, Ont. Co. Ct., April 28, 1977, at p. 45 (Locke Co. Ct. J.), unreported). 
This list of exceptional circumstances was held not to be exhaustive (R. v.
Wai Ting Li (No. 1), [1976] 6 W.W.R. 128 (B.C. Co. Ct.), at p. 137; Welsh
and Iannuzzi, supra, at pp. 371-72), but the study of the case law
shows that it was in fact; no other ""exceptional circumstances"" were
mentioned.  Similar reasons to review the authorizations were given by the
courts: ""fraud or deception"" (Wai Ting Li, supra, at p.
137); ""deception, fraud or an error or mistake or omission amounting to a
substantive defect"" (R. v. Haslam (1976), 3 C.R. (3d) 248 (Nfld.
Dist. Ct.), at p. 256).

 

                   For
example, in Re Stewart and The Queen (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 391 (Ont.
H.C.), the authorization was successfully challenged by the defence on the
ground that the Crown had not mentioned to the authorizing judge that a similar
charge had already been laid against the accused without electronic
surveillance.  This non-disclosure vitiated the authorization because it
withheld from the authorizing judge that other means of investigation existed;
the wiretapping was not, therefore, appropriate.

 

                   This
illustrates that, in the pre-Charter  era, authorizations to intercept
private communications could not be challenged, unless fraud or non-disclosure
was alleged.   (See: Re Regina and Kozak (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 235
(B.C.S.C.); Re Regina and Collos (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 405 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Gill (1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 390 (B.C.C.A.).  See also: Stanley A. Cohen, Invasion
of Privacy: Police and Electronic Surveillance in Canada (1983), at pp.
156-58; Daniel A. Bellemare, L'écoute électronique au Canada (1981), at
pp. 352-61; and David Watt, Law of Electronic Surveillance in Canada
(1979), at pp. 248-55.)  There was simply no right for an accused to have the
sealed packet opened upon request.  Dickson J. (later C.J.), in a concurrent
opinion in Wilson v. The Queen, supra, found that the trial judge
had made a prima facie finding of misleading disclosure and, therefore,
expressed the following obiter dictum, at p. 622:

 

It is not necessary to decide whether this restricted
view of s. 178.14 is correct.  There is a broad consensus that prima
facie evidence of fraud or non-disclosure is a valid reason for opening the
packet.  Misleading disclosure would be in the same category. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Any
application for review of an authorization had to be presented before the court
that made it (Wilson v. The Queen, supra, at p. 607 (McIntyre
J.)).  However, a mere attempt to attack the admissibility of the evidence
based on speculation was not enough per se.  As Bellemare, supra,
wrote, at p. 353:

 

                   [translation]
It must first be pointed out that the review of the authorization implicitly
provided for in s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) must not be used as a pretext for ""fishing
expeditions"". In other words, the remedy provided for in s.
178.14(1) (a)(ii) was not enacted to DISCOVER any substantive
irregularities that may have tainted the authorization issuing process, but
rather to ASCERTAIN and CONFIRM the existence of substantive
defects otherwise discovered by the applicant, which must have been previously
alleged and established by him in court. [Emphasis added; italics in
original.]

                   

 

                   In
my view, the following passage of Anderson J.'s  (later J.A.) decision in Miller
and Thomas, supra, at p. 288, represented the state of the law at
the time:

 

                   Another reason for holding that there
is no right of review, is that, in my opinion, Parliament did not provide
for or intend that the sealed packet be opened merely for the purpose of
ascertaining whether grounds existed for quashing the authorization.  I do not
think that a judicial discretion (to open the packet) should be exercised on
the basis that defence counsel wish to engage in a fishing expedition.  Surely,
at the very least, some grounds must be stated before an application to open
the packet can succeed.  If this were not so, the material which Parliament
ordered should be kept secret would become a matter of public knowledge, in
every case, where it was stated that the Crown wished to make use of private
communications or evidence derived by the use of private communications.  All
that would be required to obtain an order to have the packet opened and copies
of the material made available to defence counsel would be a request that
counsel desired to see the material contained in the sealed packet for purposes
of their defence.  Although it may be presumed that 99% of all affidavits
filed pursuant to s. 178.13 would be flawless in every respect, yet the highly
confidential material would be aired to public view in all cases. [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   This
view is consistent with the general and long held rule in criminal and civil
law forbidding fishing expeditions (Cloutier v. The Queen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 709; McKercher v. Vancouver-Iowa Shingle Co., [1929] 4 D.L.R. 231
(B.C.S.C.); Wright v. Doe (1837), 7 AD. & E. 313, 112 E.R. 488 (Ex.
Ch.); Cross on Evidence (7th ed. 1990), at pp. 51 et seq.; Halsbury's
Laws of England (4th ed. 1976), vol. 17, para. 5, at p. 7; and Wigmore
on Evidence (3rd ed. 1940), vol. 1, para. 9, at p. 289).  See also, in
the context of wiretap authorizations: Re Royal Commission Inquiry into the
Activities of Royal American Shows Inc. (No. 3), supra, at p. 219; Haslam,
supra, at pp. 256-58; R. v. Sabloff, Sup. Ct. Montréal, No.
500-27-005928-79, October 10, 1979, J.E. 80-73, at p. 13 (Greenberg J.); Re
Donnelly and Acheson and The Queen (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 58 (Alta. S.C.T.D.),
at p. 65;  Re Stewart and The Queen, supra, at pp. 401-2; and R.
v. Sklar, B.C.S.C., October 17, 1975, at p. 11 (Toy J.), unreported.

 

                   That
was before the Charter .  Since the advent of the Charter , a line
of cases ordering unlimited access to the sealed packet arose and culminated
with the majority opinion of this Court in Garofoli, Lachance, Dersch
and Zito, supra.

 

                   A
review of post-Charter decisions involving the opening of the sealed
packet begins with the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Finlay and Grellette (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada refused, February 28, 1986, [1986] 1 S.C.R. ix). 
Martin J.A. (Blair J.A. and Cory J.A. (now of this Court) concurring) stated at
p. 76:

 

                   The case-law severely restricts the
accused's access to the sealed packet and generally is to the effect that the
sealed packet may only be opened where there is prima facie evidence of
fraud or non-disclosure: see Re Miller and Thomas and The Queen...;  Re
Stewart and The Queen...;  Re Royal Com'n Inquiry into Activities of
Royal American Shows Inc. (No. 3) ...;  Watt ...;  Cohen ...  [References
omitted.]

 

                   However,
as Martin J.A. noted (at p. 77):

 

                   Counsel for the appellants stated
that in consequence of the restriction placed on an accused's access to the
sealed packet, the accused finds himself in an impossible situation.  To
ascertain whether there has been fraud or non-disclosure he requires access to
the sealed packet, but he cannot gain access to the sealed packet unless he
proves fraud or non-disclosure....

 

                   Counsel for the appellants contended
that the denial to the accused of access to the application and accompanying
material leading to the authorization precludes the accused from making full
answer and defence and hence Part IV.1 is unconstitutional.  Mr. Hubbard for
the Attorney-General of Canada responded to this argument by pointing out,
quite correctly in my view, that no provision in Part IV.1 and, in particular,
no provision in s. 178.14 providing for the confidentiality of the material
leading to the authorization denies an accused access to that material
where it is essential to his defence.  Rather, he said such denial results from
the way in which the provisions have been interpreted by the courts.  [Italics
in original.]

 

                   He
then observed (at p. 77):

 

                   It may be that the interests
protected by the policy underlying the restriction of an accused's access to
the sealed packet can in many cases be effectively protected in other ways, e.g.,
by deleting in the copy supplied to the accused the names of informers and
innocent persons who might be injured by the revelation of their names.

 

                   In Wilson v. The Queen, supra,
Mr. Justice Dickson said at p. 621 S.C.R., p. 109 C.C.C., p. 589 D.L.R.:

 

The affidavit would not need to be made public in order
to rule evidence inadmissible; selected aspects only could be made public.  As
Stanley A. Cohen suggests in his work Invasion of Privacy: Police and
Electronic Surveillance in Canada (1983), the integrity of the packet might
be preserved ""through judicial screening and, if access is necessary,
judicial editing"" (p. 155).

 

                   Martin
J.A., while dismissing the appeal, then concluded as follows at p. 77:

 

                   In any event, I do not consider
that the case-law restricting the accused's access to the sealed packet renders
Part IV.1 unconstitutional.  The restriction may be relevant to the issue of
whether the accused in a particular case has been denied a fair trial, secured
by s. 7  of the Charter , but it does not render Part IV.1
unconstitutional as contravening s. 8  of the Charter . [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   That
decision was interpreted in subsequent cases as a proposition for the opening
of the packet even in the absence of allegations of fraud, non-disclosure or
misleading disclosure (R. v. Ross (1985), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 264 (Ont. Dist.
Ct.); R. v. Wood (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 77 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Martel
(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 508 (P.E.I.S.C. in banco); R. v. Stacey,
Ont. H.C., May 20, 1986, Callaghan A.C.J.H.C., unreported; R. v. Birt and
Anderson (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 176 (Alta. Q.B.); R. v. Madsen and
Scobel (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 249 (N.W.T.S.C.);  R. v. Graves
(1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 552 (N.S.S.C.T.D.);  R. v. Pascoe (1987), 32
C.C.C. (3d) 61 (Sask. Q.B.); and R. v. Martin (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 257
(Ont. H.C.)).

 

                   A
contrary view was expressed in Miller and Thomas, supra, where
Anderson J. held that the sealed packet could only be opened where an accused
had demonstrated that an authorization was obtained by fraud, non-disclosure or
for an unlawful purpose.  That decision was also followed in a number of
subsequent cases (R. v. Rowbotham (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 164 (Ont. H.C.); Re
Regina and Dersch (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 346 (B.C.S.C.); R. v. Stensrud
and Smith (1987), 56 Sask. R. 44 (Q.B.)), and particularly in the case of Dersch
(B.C.C.A.), supra, where Esson J.A. (later C.J.S.C.) undertook a
comprehensive and detailed analysis of the case law on this issue including Parmar
(No. 1), supra.  In that case, Watt J. of the Ontario High Court of
Justice had recognized an automatic right to access to the sealed packet by an
accused.  Esson J.A. strongly objected to Parmar (No. 1)'s
""constitutional right to fish"" in the following terms (at p. 465):

 

The law forbids fishing in [constitutional] waters.  The
law which forbids fishing does not offend the constitution.  It is therefore in
full force and effect.  So there must still be no fishing in these waters.

 

                   Concluding
that the automatic opening of the packet was neither a constitutional
requirement nor a proper interpretation of s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii) of the Criminal
Code , Esson J.A. summarized his reasons (at pp. 475-76):

 

The basic reason for that conclusion is that the Charter 
has not affected, in any general way, the statutory and case law which
restricts access to the packet and precludes the trial judge from going behind
the authorization.  That follows from the finding that Part IV.1 is consistent
with the Charter .

 

                   The reasoning in the unrestricted
access cases disregards the significance of the constitutionality of the
legislation and, beyond that, is based on errors including the following:

 

1.It relies upon a process of reading down the language
of the law and reading in substitute provisions deemed by the court to be more
appropriate.  That approach would not be permissible even if done with a view
to salvaging the constitutionality of the law (Hunter v. Southam).  It
is even less justified when done in respect of a law of unchallenged
constitutionality.

 

2.It gives to the language of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter  expanded meanings without regard to the history and traditions of
our law; and without regard to the purpose intended to be achieved by the
Charter  sections.

 

3.It overlooks the significance of s. 24(2) which is the
specific Charter  provision governing exclusion of evidence; and overlooks the
consideration that the careful balancing of interests in that section renders
it particularly inappropriate to apply the Charter  to extend the scope of the
arbitrary and unbalanced exclusionary rule embodied in s. 178.16 of the Code.

 

4.It applies the presumption of innocence, which is
applicable to individuals who face charges, to negate general laws based on the
recognition that we have and always will have crime and criminals.

 

                   In
Playford, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal rejected Esson J.A.'s
analysis on the basis that (at pp. 180-81, Goodman J.A. (Blair and Cory JJ.A.
concurring)):

 

... once the authorization and any renewal thereof has
expired or the investigation of the offence and the persons suspected of being
involved therein has been completed, there is no logical or policy reason to
refuse to reveal the contents of the sealed packet, provided that, where
appropriate to protect the identity of an informant, the contents of the sealed
packet may be properly edited.  It is no answer to say that the provision of
access by the accused to the affidavit may result in a fishing expedition which
will unduly lengthen trials.... There is no sensible reason for requiring an
accused to provide an evidentiary basis for requiring a sealed packet to be
opened.  As pointed out previously, the evidentiary basis may exist in the
material in the sealed packet to which he [or she] does not have access.

 

                   Playford was
followed in the subsequent cases of Rowbotham, Lachance and Garofoli
of the Ontario Court of Appeal.  In R. v. Zito (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d)
565, McCarthy J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Bisson J.A. (now C.J.) and
Philippon J. (ad hoc) concurring) applied the decisions of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in Rowbotham and Garofoli to hold that the sealed
packet must be opened.  Garofoli, Lachance, Dersch and Zito
reached our Court where a majority agreed with the positions taken by the Court
of Appeal of Ontario.  In Dersch, Sopinka J. for the majority held, at
p. 1517:

 

Prima facie misconduct is not required to be
shown by the accused applicant who seeks access to the sealed packet.  The
assertion, as in this case, that the admission of the evidence is challenged
and that access is required in order to permit full answer and defence to be
made is sufficient.

 

                   The
minority, per McLachlin J., in which I concurred, ""[o]n a balancing
approach"", would have required an accused to ""make a preliminary
showing that his or her interest in privacy or a fair trial justifies opening
the packet"" (Garofoli, supra, at p. 1482).  That view did not
prevail.

 

                   That
there is an automatic right for an accused to open the sealed packet was
settled by Dersch.  Also, in accordance with such a right, that the
judge on a Wilson review is entitled to edit the contents of the sealed
package to protect the state's legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of the
identity of informers and the police investigation techniques is settled by Garofoli.

 

                   Section
178.14  of the Criminal Code  of 1970 was the law at the time of the
trials in Garofoli, Lachance, Dersch and Zito and,
accordingly, our judgments in those cases were based on s. 178.14  of the Criminal
Code .  Since then, s. 178.14  was reenacted as s. 187  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (in the new Part VI), and amended by the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1985, R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.).  This amendment
has not modified the substance of the former s. 178.14(1) (a)(ii).  The
present appeals are governed by this s. 187 :

 

                   187. (1) All documents
relating to an application made pursuant to section 185 or subsection 186(6) or
196(2) are confidential and, with the exception of the authorization, shall
be placed in a packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made
immediately on determination of the application, and that packet shall
be kept in the custody of the court in a place to which the public has no
access or in such other place as the judge may authorize and shall not be

 

(a) opened or the contents thereof removed except

 

(i) for the purpose of dealing with an application for
renewal of the authorization, or

 

(ii) pursuant to an order of a judge of a superior court
of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552; [Modifications
underlined.]

 

                   However,
that s. 187  of the Criminal Code  was repealed by An Act to amend the
Criminal Code, the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act  and the
Radiocommunication Act, S.C. 1993, c. 40, s. 7 (Bill C-10), which came into
force on August 1, 1993, and replaced by the following disposition:

 

                   187. (1) All
documents relating to an application made pursuant to any provision of this
Part are confidential and, subject to subsection (1.1), shall be placed
in a packet and sealed by the judge to whom the application is made immediately
on determination of the application, and that packet shall be kept in the
custody of the court in a place to which the public has no access or in such
other place as the judge may authorize and shall not be dealt with except in
accordance with subsections (1.2) to (1.5).

 

                   (1.1) An authorization given under
this Part need not be placed in the packet except where, pursuant to subsection
184.3(7) or (8), the original authorization is in the hands of the judge, in
which case that judge must place it in the packet and the facsimile remains
with the applicant.

 

                   (1.2) The sealed packet may be opened
and its contents removed for the purpose of dealing with an application for a
further authorization or with an application for renewal of an authorization.

 

                   (1.3) A provincial court judge, a
judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in
section 552 may order that the sealed packet be opened and its contents removed
for the purpose of copying and examining the documents contained in the packet.

 

                   (1.4) A judge or provincial
court judge before whom a trial is to be held and who has jurisdiction
in the province in which an authorization was given may order
that the sealed packet be opened and its contents removed for the purpose
of copying and examining the documents contained in the packet if

 

(a) any matter relevant to the authorization
or any evidence obtained pursuant to the authorization is in issue in the
trial; and

 

(b) the accused applies for such an order for the
purpose of consulting the documents to prepare for trial.

 

                   (1.5) Where a sealed packet is
opened, its contents shall not be destroyed except pursuant to an order of a
judge of the same court as the judge who gave the authorization.

 

                   (2) An order under subsection (1.2),
(1.3), (1.4) or (1.5) made with respect to documents relating to an application
made pursuant to section 185 or subsection 186(6) or 196(2) may only be made
after the Attorney General or the Solicitor General by whom or on whose
authority the application for the authorization to which the order relates was
made has been given an opportunity to be heard.

 

                   (3) An order under subsection (1.2),
(1.3), (1.4) or (1.5) made with respect to documents relating to an application
made pursuant to subsection 184.2(2) or section 184.3 may only be made after
the Attorney General has been given an opportunity to be heard.

 

                   (4) Where a prosecution has been
commenced and an accused applies for an order for the copying and examination
of documents pursuant to subsection (1.3) or (1.4), the judge shall not,
notwithstanding those subsections, provide any copy of any document to the
accused until the prosecutor has deleted any part of the copy of the document
that the prosecutor believes would be prejudicial to the public interest,
including any part that the prosecutor believes could

 

(a) compromise the identity of any confidential
informant;

 

(b) compromise the nature and extent of ongoing
investigations;

 

(c) endanger persons engaged in particular
intelligence-gathering techniques and thereby prejudice future investigations
in which similar techniques would be used; or

 

(d) prejudice the interests of innocent persons.

 

                   (5) After the prosecutor has deleted
the parts of the copy of the document to be given to the accused under
subsection (4), the accused shall be provided with an edited copy of the
document.

 

                   (6) After the accused has received an
edited copy of a document, the prosecutor shall keep a copy of the original
document, and an edited copy of the document and the original document shall be
returned to the packet and the packet resealed.

 

                   (7) An accused to whom an edited
copy of a document has been provided pursuant to subsection (5) may request
that the judge before whom the trial is to be held order that any part of the
document deleted by the prosecutor be made available to the accused, and the
judge shall order that a copy of any part that, in the opinion of the judge,
is required in order for the accused to make full answer and defence and for
which the provision of a judicial summary would not be sufficient, be made
available to the accused. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   According
to this new legislation, the opening of the packet is not mandatory and once
the packet is opened, ss. 187(4) to 187(7) now provide a procedure for the
editing of the affidavit and the reviewing of such editing.  This new
legislation makes it clear, in my view, that fishing expeditions are now out
and the discretion of the review judge, who is now the trial judge, is enlarged
as is the prosecution's, although the ""accused shall be provided with an
edited copy of the document"", should the judge be satisfied that the
conditions set on in subs. (1.4)(a) and (b) of s. 187  in
particular are complied with as well as all other requirements of s. 187 .  It
is only if the judge is of the opinion that a deleted part of the affidavit is
required in order for the accused to make full answer and defence and for which
the provision of a judicial summary would not be sufficient, that such part is
to be made available to the accused.  Moreover, the interests that the editing
process are to protect are clearly set out in this new s. 187 .  

 

                   A
further important consideration at the heart of this case is the necessity to
protect the identity of police informers.  As Beetz J., for the Court, said in Bisaillon
v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60, at p. 93:

 

                   It follows from these reasons that
at common law the secrecy rule regarding police informers' identity has chiefly
taken form of rules of evidence based on the public interest, which
prohibit judicial disclosure of police informers' identity by peace officers
who have learned the informers' identity in the course of their duties.  A
witness also may not be compelled to state whether he [or she] is himself [or
herself] a police informer.  The rule was developed in criminal proceedings,
apparently in trials for high treason, but it also applies in civil matters,
and in both cases it has been established for reasons which relate to the
essential effectiveness of the criminal law....  Its application does not
depend on the judge's discretion, as it is a legal rule of public order by
which the judge is bound. [Emphasis added.]

 

The only
exception to that strict rule of very long standing is when an accused's
innocence is at stake, which is clearly not the case here.  Beetz J. wrote, at
p. 93:

 

The rule is subject to only one exception, imposed by
the need to demonstrate the innocence of an accused person.  There are no
exceptions in proceedings other than criminal.

 

                   There
is no need to go to great lengths to know what is the fate of police informers
in criminal trials, particularly so in drug trafficking and conspiracy cases. 
Police witness programs, which also apply to informers, eloquently speak to the
dangers that such people are facing.  Also significant is the expense which
society incurs to insure the safety of those who, at the risk of their lives in
many cases, help society rid itself of those criminal elements which jeopardize
the foundation of a civilized world, and the security and well-being of its
citizens.  Editing the information relating to wiretap by the police of
conversations in the context of a criminal investigation is part of this effort
by society to protect both the identity of informers and police investigation
techniques.  The unsubstantiated pretext of the right to full and fair defence
should not be allowed to put in jeopardy such an important tool in the fight
against crime.

 

                   The
same concerns guided the developments in the common law world, including, for
example, the American case law.  In Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S.
53 (1957), the leading case on ""informers' privilege"" and the
non-disclosure of their identity, Burton J., speaking for the majority of the
United States Supreme Court, underlined the rationale of the rule (at p. 59):

 

                   What is usually referred to as the
informer's privilege is in reality the Government's privilege to withhold from
disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law
to officers charged with enforcement of that law....  The purpose of the
privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective
law enforcement.  The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to
communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement
officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that
obligation. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Clark
J., in dissent, agreed (at pp. 66-67):

 

                   First, it is well to remember that
the illegal traffic in narcotic drugs poses a most serious social problem ....
Moreover, it is a most difficult crime to detect and prove....  Enforcement is,
therefore, most difficult without the use of ""stool pigeons"" or
informants.  Their use has long had the approval of the courts.  To give them
protection governments have always followed a policy of nondisclosure of their
identities.  Experience teaches that once this policy is relaxed -- even
though the informant be dead -- its effectiveness is destroyed.  Once an
informant is known the drug traffickers are quick to retaliate.  Dead men tell
no tales.  The old penalty of tongue removal, once visited upon the informer
Larunda, has been found obsolete. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300 (1967), the United States Supreme
Court, in the context of a charge of possession of narcotics, reiterated its
position (at p. 311, Stewart J. for the majority):

 

                   What Roviaro thus makes clear
is that this Court was unwilling to impose any absolute rule requiring
disclosure of an informer's identity even in formulating evidentiary rules for
federal criminal trials.  Much less has the Court ever approached the
formulation of a federal evidentiary rule of compulsory disclosure where the
issue is the preliminary one of probable cause, and guilt or innocence is not
at stake.  Indeed, we have repeatedly made clear that federal officers need not
disclose an informer's identity in applying for an arrest or search warrant.
[Emphasis added; italics in original.]

 

                   Even
the United States Supreme Court, in the leading case of Franks v. Delaware,
supra, did not go as far as our Court did in Dersch, supra. 
It held that the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments require an evidentiary
hearing if the accused makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false
statement was included by the affiant intentionally or with reckless disregard
for the truth and that the false statement is necessary to the finding of
probable cause.  It also emphasized that the ""deliberate falsity or
reckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today is only that of the
affiant, not of any nongovernmental informant"" (Blackmun J., for the
majority, at p. 171 (emphasis added)).  The decision in Franks neither
required nor contemplated routine disclosure of informant's identities and the
Court took care to avoid deciding or predetermining ""the difficult
question whether a reviewing court must ever require the revelation of the
identity of an informant once a substantial preliminary showing of falsity has
been made"" (Blackmun J., at p. 170).  See also: Colorado v. Nunez,
465 U.S. 324 (1984), at pp. 326-27 (White J.).

 

                   The
rule set out in Roviaro has been consistently followed in wiretapping
cases.  See: United Sates v. Cantor, 470 F.2d 890 (3d Cir. 1972), at p.
892 (Rosenn J.); United States v. D'Alfonso, 357 F. Supp. 1341 (E.D. Pa.
1973), at p. 1342 (Newcomer J.); People v. Sturgis, 352 N.Y.S.2d 942
(Sup. Ct. 1973), at pp. 948-49 (Myers J.); United States v. Garramone,
374 F. Supp. 256 (E.D. Pa. 1974), at p. 259 (Bechtle J.); and United States
v. Danovaro, 877 F.2d 583 (7th Cir. 1989), at pp. 587-88 (Easterbrook J.).

 

                   In
State of New Jersey v. Garcia, 618 A.2d 326 (1993), the Supreme Court of
New Jersey held that, under a disposition creating an ""official
information privilege"" (Rules of Evidence, N.J.S.A. 2A:84A, Rule
34), the State of New Jersey could not disclose to an accused the location from
which police conducted surveillance of criminal activity.  The court was
concerned with the safety of ongoing police operations.  Clifford J., for the
court, made the following observations (at p. 330) which are apposite in the
context of wiretapping where the safety of ongoing criminal investigations and
police investigation techniques are equally at stake:

 

                   Failure to protect the confidential
locations from which police have witnessed criminal activity would harm several
important public interests.  First, non-disclosure avoids compromising ongoing
surveillances.  Police officers often experience difficulty in finding
places from which to observe criminal conduct unobtrusively....  Failure to
conceal exact locations may force the State to choose between dropping the
charges against a defendant or losing future arrests.  Also, disclosure of the
information might cause criminal offenders simply to relocate their activities
to a place not visible from that surveillance location.

 

                   Second, the privilege, protects
police officers and private citizens from reprisal.  Officer McCauley
hesitated to reveal the surveillance location in this case because he feared
for his own safety and the safety of those who had cooperated with him.  If
those bent on crime were to learn of the location of surveillance activities,
they might resort to violence or engage in vandalism to render that site
useless.

 

                   Third, and related to the second
reason, the privilege encourages citizens to cooperate with police.  If
citizens know that a defendant charged with an offense can learn the exact
surveillance location, many will not permit use of their property. [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   On
the non-disclosure of the informers' identity in American law, see also: Wayne
R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (2nd
ed. 1987 & Supp. 1993), vol. 1, at pp. 697-711; Wigmore on Evidence,
vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961), para. 2374.

 

                   It
is against this background that the present appeals must be decided.

 

                                                                 -
III -

 

                   The
appellants' arguments relating to the sole issue of the editing by the review
judge (O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.) of the wiretap authorizations are threefold:

 

1.The review judge edited the affidavits on his own,
without first hearing submissions from the Crown;

 

2.He failed to provide defence counsel with judicial
summaries of his deletions, thus denying them the opportunity to make effective
submissions regarding those deletions; and

 

3.He deleted the following categories of information,
contrary to the guidelines set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Garofoli,
supra:

 

- information regarding informers (as opposed to
information identifying informers);

 

- information identifying informers whose identity may
no longer have been confidential by the time of trial; and

 

- irrelevant information (""commentary"",
""summary"" or ""opinion"").

 

                   I
want to emphasize at the outset that the reviewing process in the Wilson
application, and in fact the entire trial to which these appeals relate, took
place before the decisions in Garofoli, Lachance, Dersch and
Zito, supra, were rendered by our Court.  The procedural
guidelines at the time of the editing before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. (May-June
1987) were set out by Watt J. in Parmar (No. 1), supra (rendered March
10, 1987).  I will now deal with the three arguments of the appellants.

 

1.The Reviewing
Process Followed by the Reviewing Judge

 

                   The
appellants submit that the procedure adopted by the trial judge amounted to an
error of law when he carried the main part of the editing on his own before
receiving any submissions in open court from the Crown as to the nature of the
matters to be edited and the basis therefor.  According to them, since the
police investigation was completed at the time of the editing and the
affidavits in question were sworn in 1983 and 1984, three and four years before
editing, the trial judge ""had no basis upon which he could make an
informed assessment of the continued need to preserve the confidentiality of
the various sources described as confidential at the time the affidavits were
prepared"" (Doherty J.A, at p. 471), violating therefore steps one and two
of the procedure set out by Sopinka J. in Garofoli, supra.  In my
view, this submission clearly has no merits, both in fact and in law.

 

                   As
noted by Finlayson J.A. (at p. 448), when the trial judge announced his intent
to edit the affidavits on his own, the appellants' counsel did not object to
the proposed procedure.  Moreover, O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. closely followed each
step of the editing methodology recommended by Watt J. in Parmar (No. 1),
supra, at pp. 281-82, which was the law at the time.  O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J. granted the appellants' application and opened the nine sealed
packets, although seven were asked for, including therefore the seven
District Court authorizations and the two Supreme Court of Ontario
authorizations.  At a time when the onus on the reasons for access to the
contents of the sealed packet was controversial, he did not require the
appellants to establish a prima facie case of fraud or any other
preconditions in order to obtain access to the sealed packets.  He opened the
nine sealed packets, removed the affidavits and edited them himself and gave a
copy of the nine edited affidavits to the Crown for review.  O'Connell Dist.
Ct. J. then proceeded to review each affidavit with Crown counsel, identifying
each of the deletions which he had made and seeking the Crown's submissions,
the appellants' counsel being present throughout this exercise.

 

                   The
appellants' arguments are further wrong on the facts of this case, since
Crown counsel did make submissions before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.   That such
submissions be made before or after the editing cannot be material, as
long as the Crown has the opportunity to effectively indicate its position with
respect to the editing.  That was done in the present appeals.

 

                   Steps
one and two of the procedure set out by Sopinka J. in Garofoli, supra,
are the following (at p. 1461):

 

1. Upon opening of the packet, if the Crown objects to
disclosure of any of the material, an application should be made by the
Crown suggesting the nature of the matters to be edited and the basis therefor. 
Only Crown counsel will have the affidavit at this point.

 

2. The trial judge should then edit the affidavit as
proposed by Crown counsel and furnish a copy as edited to counsel for the
accused.  Submissions should then be entertained from counsel for the accused.
[Emphasis added.]

 

However,
as Sopinka J. himself said, at p. 1460, this procedure ""is not intended to
be exclusive or exhaustive"".  Therefore, since the review judge followed Parmar
(No. 1), supra, which was regarded as setting out the proper
procedure at the time, the Crown was consulted and had an input during the
editing process, and the judge remained open to suggestions by both counsel. 
In my view, there is absolutely no cause for reproach as to the manner in which
these affidavits were edited by the reviewing judge.  This argument cannot
succeed.

 

 

2.Failure to Provide Judicial Summaries of Deletions

 

                   The
appellants argue that the failure of the trial judge to provide them with
judicial summaries of the deletions denied them their right to make full answer
and defence.  They rely on step number two of the procedure suggested by
Sopinka J. in Garofoli, supra, at p. 1461, which I reproduce here
at length:

 

2. The trial judge should then edit the affidavit as
proposed by Crown counsel and furnish a copy as edited to counsel for the
accused.  Submissions should then be entertained from counsel for the accused. 
If the trial judge is of the view that counsel for the accused will not be able
to appreciate the nature of the deletions from the submissions of Crown counsel
and the edited affidavit, a form of judicial summary as to the general
nature of the deletions should be provided. [Emphasis added.]

 

As I
have pointed out earlier, Sopinka J.'s suggested procedure was not
""intended to be exclusive or exhaustive"" (p. 1460).  The need to
provide judicial summaries greatly depends on the facts of each case.

 

                   No
requirement to provide judicial summaries of deletions was part of the editing
method adopted by Watt J. in Parmar (No. 1), supra, prior to Garofoli,
supra.  Moreover, there were no judicial summaries of deleted material
provided to the defence in the editing procedure followed by the Ontario Court
of Appeal in Garofoli, supra, at pp. 111-12.  Nevertheless, in
that case, Sopinka J. held that the approach of the Ontario Court of Appeal was
in ""substantial compliance"" with the first five of the six steps of
the procedure which he suggested and that no ""issue can be taken with
respect to the procedure followed"" (Garofoli, supra, at p.
1462).

 

                   Under
these circumstances, it is difficult to hold that the trial judge erred,
particularly when appellants' counsel did not request judicial summaries as
such at the time.  In addition, no specific reason was given or facts
demonstrated by the appellants with respect to the need for judicial summaries
in the circumstances of this case.

 

                   I,
therefore, agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the appellants'
case was not impaired by the trial judge's failure to provide summaries.

 

3.The Legality of the Deletions

 

                   The
appellants' main argument rests on the contention that the trial judge
over-edited the affidavits.  In their view, there was no basis in law for the
deletion of irrelevant information (""commentary"", ""summary""
or ""opinion"") and information from informers should not have been
deleted, as opposed to information identifying informers.  They further submit
that information identifying informers whose identity may no longer have been
confidential by the time the trial was held should not have been deleted. 
According to them, the errors of the trial judge appear clearly upon a
comparison between the two affidavits edited by Bowlby J. in the Supreme Court
of Ontario trial of 1986 (R. v. Marsh, supra) and the same two
affidavits edited by Watt J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario in the second Wilson
motion presented in September 1987 with the editing made by O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J.  Finally, they argue that the failure of the trial judge to edit in
accordance with the principles in Parmar (No. 1), supra, denied
them of their right to make full answer and defence.  The dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal as well as my colleagues are of the view that the
appellants' arguments on this point must succeed.  For the following reasons, I
disagree.

 

                   In
Garofoli, supra, at p. 1460, a majority of this Court referred
with approval to the factors outlined by Watt J. in Parmar (No. 1), supra,
at pp. 281-82, in deciding what to edit:

 

(a)whether the identities of confidential police
informants, and consequently their lives and safety, may be compromised,
bearing in mind that such disclosure may occur as much by reference to the
nature of the information supplied by the confidential source as by the
publication of his or her name;

 

(b)whether the nature and extent of ongoing law
enforcement investigations would thereby be compromised;

 

(c)whether disclosure would reveal particular
intelligence-gathering techniques thereby endangering those engaged therein and
prejudicing future investigation of similar offences and the public interest in
law enforcement and crime detection, and

 

(d)whether disclosure would prejudice the interests of
innocent persons. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   This
reference to Parmar (No. 1), supra, was not intended to limit the
scope of the judicial discretion of the reviewing judge.  On the contrary, as
Sopinka J. previously said at p. 1460: 

 

Since there will be more than one method of striking a
proper balance between the interests of law enforcement and of the right to
make full answer and defence, I would not wish to place trial judges in a
""strait-jacket"" by laying down iron-clad rules with respect to
editing. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   McLachlin
J. for the minority, with whom I concurred, expressed a similar view in the
following words (at p. 1482 of Garofoli, supra):

 

Like other rights under the Charter , the right to
make full answer and defence may come into conflict with other rights and
values.  It may be necessary to balance these interests against the right to
make full answer and defence.

 

                   This is illustrated by the problem of
editing.  I agree with Sopinka J. that a judge may withhold certain portions of
the packet on grounds, for example, that those portions might disclose the
identity of an undercover operative.  Denial of this information might lead an
accused to complain about being deprived of the right to make full answer and
defence.  Nevertheless, the editing must be permitted because the public's
interest in the administration of justice outweighs the accused's interest in
obtaining the identity of the informant.  I further agree with Sopinka J.
that edited material can be considered in deciding whether the authorization
can be supported. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
my view, in editing the affidavits, the reviewing judge must have sufficient
discretion.  Such discretion is not only subjective, but depends on the facts
and the context of the case before him or her.  While, in some circumstances,
deleting the names and addresses of informers will be sufficient for their
protection, this is not necessarily so in each case.  Other details may be
sufficient to provide the necessary information to people in the know in order
to deal with the informer the way that they generally are dealt with in those
circles.  McLachlin J. made the following observations about the opening of the
sealed packet which are apposite in the context of the editing process (at p.
1479):

 

...  the matter is in the discretion of the judge
hearing the application.  He or she must decide whether the packet should be
opened, by asking whether the interest of the accused in opening the packet
is outweighed by the public interest in the administration of justice.
[Emphasis added.]

 

This is
even now more so, given the enactment of the new legislation dealing with the
opening of the sealed packet as I indicated earlier.  In my view, a similar
exercise of discretion prevails in the editing of the affidavits: the trial
judge must decide in his or her discretion what portions should be edited and
to what extent, having in mind the protection of the interests of the state in
its investigation techniques and in non-disclosure of informers' identity which
may be revealed in many details that may appear insignificant at first sight,
but which the trial judge is in the best position to appreciate.

 

                   In
the present appeals, the balancing of the interests of the appellants and the
public interest in the administration of justice in the view of the editing
judge required a more extensive editing than perhaps other judges may have
found.  However, there was in no way such an abuse of discretion which could
amount to a denial of justice or of a fair trial.  In that respect, the
reproach concerning the editing which relates to the deletion of information
from informers is unfounded.

 

                   As
I have indicated earlier, it is well recognized that the protection of police
informers is crucial to the proper administration of justice.  Police cannot
operate, particularly in drug conspiracy and drug trafficking, without such
informers.  This principle has been recognized by our Court in Solicitor
General of Canada v. Royal Commission of Inquiry (Health Records in Ontario),
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 494, where Martland J., speaking for the majority, said (at pp.
527, 535 and 536):

 

                   The law has recognized for many years
the existence of a ""police-informer"" privilege.  It was described by
Lord Esher in the leading case of Marks v. Beyfus (1890), 25 Q.B.D. 494
[C.A.], at p. 498 as being a rule of public policy that is not a matter of
discretion.... 

                                                                     

                                                                    ...

 

                   These statements give clear
recognition to the existence of an established rule of law, for the purpose
of effective policing, which recognizes that sources of police information
must be withheld from forensic investigation. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

In my opinion, the immunity from disclosure which is
accorded in relation to information furnished to the police in the course of
the performance of their duties is general in its scope.  This has become
recognized as a rule of law with only one recognized exception, namely [where
upon the trial of defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity
of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the
offence]. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
Bisaillon v. Keable, supra, at pp. 88-98 (Beetz J.), to which I
referred earlier, this Court reiterated the state's interest in protecting
police informers.  Such is also the case in the United States and generally in
the common law world.

 

                   Cory
J.A. discussed the rule in the case of drug-related crimes, in R. v. Hunter
(1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 18:

 

                   The rule against the non-disclosure
of information which might identify an informer is one of long standing.  It
developed from an acceptance of the role of informers in the solution of crimes
and the apprehension of criminals.  It was recognized that citizens have a duty
to divulge to the police any information that they may have pertaining to the
commission of a crime.  It was also obvious to the courts from very early times
that the identity of an informer would have to be concealed both for his
or her own protection, and to encourage others to divulge to the authorities
any information pertaining to crimes.  It was in order to achieve these goals
that the rule was developed. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I
note that Cory J.A. not only referred to the name of the informer, but rather
to its ""identity"", a broader concept.  Speaking for the majority of
this Court in R. v. Scott, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, Cory J. again stressed
the importance of hiding the identity of informers (at p. 994):

 

                   The value of informers to police
investigations has long been recognized.  As long as crimes have been
committed, certainly as long as they have been prosecuted, informers have
played an important role in their investigation.  It may well be true that some
informers act for compensation or for self-serving purposes.  Whatever their
motives, the position of informers is always precarious and their role is
fraught with danger.

 

                   The role of informers in drug-related
cases is particularly important and dangerous.  Informers often provide the
only means for the police to gain some knowledge of the workings of drug
trafficking operations and networks.  It has been estimated that in the United
Sates some ninety-five per cent of all federal narcotics cases involve the work
of informers....

 

                   Trafficking in narcotics is a
lucrative enterprise.  The retribution wreaked on informers and undercover
officers who attempt to gather evidence is often obscenely cruel.  Little
assistance can be expected from informers if their identity is not protected. 
There can be no relationship of trust established by the police with informers
without that protection.  If the investigation of drug-related crime is to
continue then, to the extent it is possible, the identity of informers must be
protected.

 

                   The need to protect the identity
of an informer has long been recognized by the courts of Canada and other
jurisdictions. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   The
following passage from Anderson J.'s reasons in Miller and Thomas, supra,
at p. 292, is still very relevant today:

 

If the secret material were revealed to the general
public, the following results might occur:

 

(1)The lives and safety of informers would be in
jeopardy.

 

(2)The identity of ""undercover"" agents
would be revealed.  This would be so even if the names of the informants or the
""undercover"" agents were not made known, because the revealing of the
information would, in most cases, in itself make known the identity of the
informer or the ""undercover"" agent.

 

(3)The information relating to incomplete investigations
would be revealed.

 

(4)The modus operandi of the police would be
revealed.

 

(5)Information relating to innocent persons would be
revealed. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In
that perspective, the scope of the editing does not only include the names and
the addresses of the informers, but also, and perhaps more important, the
whereabouts and other details which could help to locate and identify them. 
The context and facts of a particular case are also crucial to the range of the
editing.  In cases of drug-related infractions, organized networks of narcotic
distribution and motorcycle clubs such as in the present appeals, it would not
be surprising to find that the main if not the only reason why accused wish to
have access to the unedited affidavits and to cross-examine the affiants and
sub-affiants is precisely to identify informers so they can be dealt with. 
Their life may be in jeopardy.  Therefore, the slightest detail that might help
identify an informer must be edited by the trial judge.  That is where the
judge's discretion enters into play as an essential tool for the protection of
informers.

 

                   That
is precisely what O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. did, as he stated in his reasons.  He
had the discretion to edit, and such discretion demanded, in his view, that he
edit to the extent he did, in order to delete information regarding informers
on the basis that such information was likely to lead to their identification. 
Perhaps in so doing the editing judge was over-cautious in his attempt to protect
the identity of the informers and the nature of the undercover operation. 
Nevertheless, this was within his discretion and could not amount to an error
of law in the absence of a denial of justice or of full and fair defence.  

 

                   The
appellants' other submission is that the information identifying informers,
whose identity may no longer have been confidential by time of trial, should
also not have been deleted by O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.  Whatever the merits of
that position, I note that counsel for the appellants had the opportunity to
present their submissions over the course of two days with respect to the
editing O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. had done (May 19 and 20, 1987).  The arguments
of counsel for the appellants were, at that time, only directed towards the
deletion of information from informers, as opposed to information identifying
informers, and the specific issue of possible loss of confidentiality of some
informers was never raised.  This is significant in my view and the appellants
cannot today, without more, challenge such editing.  At the time of the
editing, the trial had not been held and there was no way for the trial judge
to know whether, at the time of trial, such confidentiality would become
unnecessary.  Besides, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the
reviewing judge was informed that the material in the affidavits edited out by
Bowlby J. was not, or had ceased to be, confidential and, therefore, could be
released.  Contrary to what my colleague Sopinka J. holds, I am of the opinion
that the reviewing judge could not have presumed, at  the time of his review,
that the version of the affidavits as edited and released by Bowlby J. was not
confidential anymore.  The appellants' argument cannot succeed.

 

                   As
to appellants' further argument, the deletion of irrelevant information
(""commentary"", ""summary"" or ""opinion"") made by
O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. may be more questionable, as my colleague Sopinka J.
notes.  Nevertheless, these deletions were minor and are irrelevant as a basis
for the issuing of the authorizations.  As Finlayson J.A. pointed out, that
""is  but one opinion, however, and is not enough to override that of an
experienced trial judge"" (p. 450).  Moreover, this falls within the trial
judge's discretion and surely it is not enough to constitute unfairness and
warrant a new trial, especially considering all the circumstances of this case
and, in particular, in respect with the editing process, the lengthy
cross-examination of the affiants and of two additional witnesses (12 days). 
The appellants had every opportunity to explore the veracity of the affidavits
and the probable cause for requesting (and granting) the authorizations in the
first place.  That is the important issue.

 

                   Sopinka
J. argues that had the appellants had access to the material contained in the
excised portions of the affidavits, they could have used this information to
impugn the contents of the affidavits which had been disclosed.  In my view,
this argument is largely self-defeating because the same could be said about
the authorized deletions, i.e. regarding the names and the addresses of the
informers.  On that view, all the deletions could be used by an accused
to demonstrate the inaccuracy of allegations made in the affidavits, fraud, or
non-disclosure.  Such a position simply ignores the continuing need for
confidentiality which I have discussed at length.

 

                   One
must not ignore that, in his reasons for judgment regarding deletions,
O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. specifically indicated that the only deletions he made
were related to the identity of informers and some irrelevant commentary.  If
that is so, it is entirely proper and in accordance with Garofoli, supra. 
I note that the reasons of O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. were not challenged.

 

                   The
comparison between the two affidavits edited by Bowlby J. in the Supreme Court
of Ontario trial of 1986 (R. v. Marsh, supra) and the same two
affidavits edited by Watt J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario in the second Wilson
motion presented in September 1987 with the editing made by O'Connell Dist. Ct.
J. is not relevant.  In the exercise of their discretion, judges might hold
different views and come to different conclusions.  As long as the exercise of
discretion is made judiciously and judicially, there is no ground for
reproach.  This is the case here.  There is no magic formula and the
circumstances of a particular case will mandate certain courses of action. 
Judgment and common sense will have to be exercised.  One may have a different
view than another, but that is the name of the game of discretion, providing
fundamental rules of justice are respected.  Dickson J.'s comments in Rathwell
v. Rathwell, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436, although in the context of matrimonial
property disputes, are relevant to the present matter (at p. 448):

 

                   The need for certainty in matrimonial
property disputes is unquestionable, but it is a certainty of legal
principle hedging in a judicial discretion capable of redressing injustice and
relieving oppression. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Finally,
on the question of prejudice, I am in complete agreement with Finlayson J.A.
when he says (at p. 453):

 

                   On balance, I do not think the
appellants Farinacci, Lépine and Jeffreys can show significant prejudice as a
result of the editing process.  In the absence of such prejudice, the failure
of the trial judge to fully anticipate guidelines that would be set down by
subsequent courts for editing affidavits is not sufficient, on appeal, to set
aside the authorizations in question.

 

Even
assuming that the deletions made by the trial judge were excessive to the point
of amounting to an error, no prejudice resulting from those deletions was
demonstrated.  Moreover, the judge allowed cross-examination of the three
affiants and two additional witnesses for 12 full days.  The appellants were
unable to demonstrate that the authorizations to intercept private
communications were facially deficient, that the edited affidavits failed to
set out reasonable and probable grounds or that the affiants committed fraud,
misleading disclosure or non-disclosure in their request for the authorizations
to wiretap appellants' telephone conversations.  Besides, as I said earlier,
counsel for the appellants recognized that had the affidavits submitted to the
judge in order to obtain the wiretap authorizations been the edited
affidavits, such affidavits would have been sufficient for the issuing
of the authorizations.  In these circumstances, I cannot find prejudice.  The
purpose of a review is precisely to ascertain that the authorizations were
properly issued, not to permit the accused to go on fishing expeditions to
attempt to identify informers, which would be an abuse of the process in
itself.  The exercise that the appellants went through here, to no avail in my
view, had the effect of considerably prolonging the proceedings, at a very
substantial cost to the justice system.  This, in my opinion, is only
commendable when there is ground to suspect that rights have been violated and
a miscarriage of justice has been committed; the grounds of appeal here at
issue did not reveal any.  They were worded in pure legal technicalities which
have no bearing on the innocence or the guilt of an accused and, for that
matter, on the rendering of justice.

 

                                                                 -

Conclusion

 

                   Police
wiretapping of telephone conversations and the use of informers are essential
tools in discovering criminal activity and bringing to justice those people who
are shattering the foundation of society.  This is particularly so in cases of
drug trafficking which is today a ""pernicious scourge in our
society"", as my colleague Sopinka J., speaking for the Court, has eloquently
stated in R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, at p. 241.

 

                   The
more sophisticated criminals become in their pursuit of greed and revenge, the
more sophisticated police strategies and devices must become to detect and
deter such criminal activity.

 

                   In
a free and democratic society, contrary to totalitarian regimes, the police
cannot barge into people's homes, seize documents and goods, wiretap
conversations and arrest people without probable and reasonable grounds to
believe that a crime has been or is being committed.  As a general rule, the
police must obtain prior authorizations from a judge and, to that end, must
establish reasonable and probable  cause.  Once that has been demonstrated, the
authorizations are legal and that is the end of the matter.  The guilt or
innocence of an accused are not at stake at this stage, it is the violation of
an accused's rights under the Charter  which is examined.  Once
established that there is no violation, there is no more purpose to the
exercise.

 

                   The
balance between the protection of society and the respect of individual rights,
be they those of criminals, has been struck in s. 178.14  of the Criminal
Code  (later s. 187 ).  In my view, those rules were respected here.  The
wiretap of the appellants' conversations was properly authorized by a judge,
was relevant and admissible at their trial and as such admitted.  The
appellants had nothing but a fair trial, there was no miscarriage of justice
and no violation of the right to make a full and fair defence.  There is
nothing in the treatment of the sealed packets by the reviewing judge which
constituted a reviewable error.

 

                   The
procedure followed and the editing by the trial judge of the affidavits in
support of the authorizations to intercept private communications did not
deprive the appellants of their right to make full answer and defence as
guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  The editing
process followed by the trial judge was a proper exercise of his discretion
and, as such, did not constitute an error of law.  Therefore, the
authorizations were valid and there is no need to consider the application s.
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  to the present appeals.  Like
Finlayson J.A. said, ""I have no sense that the appellants received anything
less than a fair trial"" (p. 456).

 

                   As
a result, I would dismiss the appeals and affirm the convictions of the
appellants.

1976 No. 3, arts. 1, 3, 3(3), 4(iii), 8.

 

                   Respondent
participated in a scheme to import cocaine illegally from Colombia by airplane ‑‑
the Airplane Deal.  The scheme was to be financed by a secondary plan to import
drugs into Canada from New York.  When the New York Deal failed, respondent
became involved in the planning to salvage the Airplane Deal.

 

                   An airplane owned
by one of the conspirators was refurbished in Florida and flown from the United
States to Colombia where it received a large cargo of cocaine for transit over
the United States to Nova Scotia.  The execution of the Airplane Deal ended
with the seizure of the cocaine and the arrest of a number of the co‑conspirators
found on the airplane at an airport in Pennsylvania where the airplane had made
an ""unscheduled"" stop for refuelling.

 

                   Respondent and 15
others were indicted in U.S. District Court with one count of conspiracy to
distribute cocaine.  The United States sought respondent's extradition because
of his role in the conspiracy even though he was never in that country at the
relevant times.  The extradition judge dismissed the application for committal
on the basis that the United States had no jurisdiction to prosecute the
offence charged and discharged the respondent.  Leave to appeal to this Court
was then granted and the Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judge's order
and directed him to commit the fugitive for surrender.  The issue to be decided
was who, the Canadian executive or the judge at the extradition hearing, has
authority to consider whether the state requesting the surrender of a fugitive
has jurisdiction to prosecute the fugitive for an offence for which the
fugitive is charged.  The Court also considered the nature of the links to an
offence that must exist to warrant prosecution under Canadian law.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ.:  In extradition the concern is whether
the crime was committed in the territory or jurisdiction of the requesting
state, here the United States, not the jurisdiction (venue) of the court seized
with the matter.  This approach is the more compelling in the case of a federal
offence where the whole of the United States is the appropriate jurisdiction.

 

                   An extradition
judge is not vested with the function of considering the jurisdiction of the
requesting state to prosecute the offence.  The judge's role under
s. 18(1) (b) of the Extradition Act  is the modest one of
determining whether the evidence would justify the fugitive's committal for
trial under Canadian law if the crime had been committed in Canada.  Nothing in
the Act requires the judge to consider where the acts charged took place, or
the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  The jurisdiction of the requesting
state and its organs to prosecute a crime are matters governed by the law of
that state.

 

                   The determination
of an extradition crime is conduct based so that the question to be asked is
whether the impugned acts or conduct, if committed in Canada, would constitute
a crime here.  The acts charged in this case would be a crime if committed in
Canada.  The so‑called ""double criminality rule"" (no one in
Canada should be extradited for behaviour that is not a crime in Canada) has
been met.  The ""mirror image"" concept should not be adopted.  

 

                   The courts are
charged with ensuring that the double criminality rule and the doctrine of
""specialty"" (which prohibits the requesting state from prosecuting
for crimes other than that for which the extradition took place) are adhered
to.  The Canadian executive and not the courts must monitor compliance with the
treaty.  The issue of whether a state has gone beyond the terms of the treaty
in exercising jurisdiction, however, is a matter between states.  Whether a
requesting state has a legitimate interest in prosecuting a fugitive is
primarily an issue for the appropriate authorities in the foreign state.

 

                   Even assuming the
extradition judge had authority under the Extradition Act  to consider
jurisdiction on the ""reverse image"" approach, the fugitive should be
surrendered.  Acts, such as the decision to refurbish the airplane and its
actual refurbishing, quite apart from the landing in Pennsylvania, were
committed in the United States and, had they been committed in Canada, would
constitute a crime in Canada sufficient to ground jurisdiction.  All the acts,
taken together, constituted ""a real and substantial link"" to the
United States.

 

                   Per Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ.:  The
question of whether there was a ""real and substantial connection"" to
the United States is one of mixed law and fact and an integral part of the
determination an extradition judge must make as to whether a prima facie
case has been made out that the crime, if committed in Canada, would warrant a
committal for trial.  A review of the Treaty and the Extradition Act 
supports the conclusion that this is a matter which is appropriately resolved
in a judicial proceeding rather than by executive fiat.  Moreover, strong
policy reasons favour this position.  The practice in Canada has been for the
extradition judge to consider jurisdiction over the offence and developments in
the common law (Sinclair v. Director of Public Prosecutions and McVey
(Re); McVey v. United States of America) do not warrant a change in this
practice.  

 

                   Article 3(3) of the
Treaty provides that the domestic law of the requested state is determinative
of whether the executive or other appropriate authority is empowered to decide
if the requested state would exercise jurisdiction in similar circumstances. 
The Treaty is, therefore, neutral on this issue.  It clearly provides, however,
that the ""mirror image"" approach is to be adopted.  This mixed
question of law and fact requires the decision‑maker to consider the
evidence as to where the acts took place, make findings in that regard and
apply the law of Canada (including s. 6(2)  of the Criminal Code 
which prohibits conviction for offences committed outside Canada and the requirement
in Libman v. The Queen that there be a real and substantial connection
with Canada).

 

                   The enforcement of
Treaty obligations is left to the parties to the Treaty unless an appropriate
authority is designated under domestic law.  Sections 13 and 18(1)(b)
of the Act, considered in the context of the Act as a whole, are a sufficient
designation to constitute the extradition judge as the appropriate authority to
decide this question.  Section 13 directs that when a fugitive is brought
before a judge, the case is to be dealt with, as nearly as possible, ""as
if the fugitive [were] brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an
indictable offence"".  Section 18(1) (b) goes on to provide that
the judge is to issue a committal order if ""such evidence is produced as
would, according to the law of Canada . . . justify the committal of
the fugitive for trial, if the crime had been committed in Canada.""  In
considering whether a crime has been committed in Canada, a judge at a
preliminary hearing would, in any case with transnational aspects, consider
whether the crime was committed outside of Canada and the effects of both s.
6(2)  of the Criminal Code  and Libman v. The Queen.  

                   

                   The extradition
judge is the forum eminently suited to determine the issue mandated by
Art. 3(3) of the Treaty.  The alternative is to relegate its determination
to the executive in some unspecified proceeding, presumably involving a hearing
to determine a mixed question of law and fact, for which no provision is made
either in the Treaty or the Act.  Leaving the question of jurisdiction to a
judge rather than the executive is more consistent with the scheme of
distribution of the respective functions of the executive and the judiciary
embodied in the Act.  This approach respects the rights of the individual, a
purpose weighing heavily in justifying extradition as a reasonable limit on the
s. 6(1) Charter right to remain in Canada.  Since only domestic law
relating to jurisdiction need be applied, judges will not become embroiled in
the lengthy and murky issue of deciding foreign law.

 

                   Finally, if the
extradition judge is not empowered to deal with jurisdiction over the offence
and the matter is exclusively within the authority of the executive, this Court
has no jurisdiction to make that determination.  This is an appeal from the
decision of the extradition judge and this Court can only make any order that
the extradition judge ought to have made.  If determination as to jurisdiction
must be made by the executive, the surrender cannot be made in compliance with
the Treaty until the executive makes that determination.

Appeal allowed.

for the appellant.

                   The judgment of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Cory and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. -- This case is
concerned with who, the Canadian executive or the judge at an extradition
hearing, has authority to consider whether the state requesting the surrender
of a fugitive has jurisdiction to prosecute the fugitive for an offence for
which the fugitive is charged.  It also considers the nature of the links to an
offence that must exist to warrant prosecution under Canadian law.

 

                   In April 1990,
several individuals, including William James McGoldrick, developed a plan (the
""Airplane Deal"" as they called it) to procure about 2000 kilograms of
cocaine in Colombia and fly it to Nova Scotia for distribution.  A plane
belonging to McGoldrick was to be refurbished in Florida and flown to Colombia
to obtain the cocaine.  The deal was expected to generate 5 to 7 million
dollars in cash or cocaine.  A Canadian named Harry Hill was involved in these
discussions and was to secure investors for the plan.

 

                   Hill approached the
respondent to solicit his participation.  The respondent discussed the matter
with Kenneth Mousseau and both of them advised him that he should meet with
Michael Vanasse.  They then developed a plan to raise enough money to finance
the deal.  This subsidiary plan was to purchase eight kilograms of cocaine in
New York City and sell it in Canada, the profits to be used to further the
Airplane Deal.  To finance the New York City Deal, the respondent and Mousseau
agreed to provide $225,000 which they were temporarily holding for a third
party.  Vanasse guaranteed the money.  Hill took $25,000 and used $15,000 as a
deposit on the Airplane Deal.  The rest of the money was eventually given to
Kenneth A. Herman, who had been brought in to supervise the New York City
Deal.  That deal collapsed when the money was stolen in New York.  The
respondent, Mousseau, Herman and Vanasse met in Ottawa in July 1990 and decided
that the best way to recoup the $225,000 was to assist Hill in the Airplane
Deal.

 

                   Preparations for
the reception of the cocaine in Nova Scotia were made by other co-conspirators
in August 1990.  The plane with a number of co-conspirators departed from, and
made several stops in Florida, refuelled in Georgia, and then left for
Colombia.  In Colombia the aircraft was loaded with 1349 kilograms of cocaine. 
The airplane, destined for Nova Scotia, made a stop in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
on September 21, 1990.  Though the stop was described as
""unscheduled"", there is some evidence that it was intended for
refuelling.  At all events, following the stop, American law enforcement
officials seized the cocaine, and McGoldrick, Hill and another were arrested.

 

                   The United States
sought the extradition of the respondent for his role in the conspiracy, though
he was never at the relevant times in the United States.  An indictment
charging him and 15 others with a single count of conspiracy to distribute
cocaine was filed on September 12, 1991 in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The affidavit evidence of a United
States Attorney indicates that this is a violation of Title 21, United
States Code, § 846, which makes unlawful the act of conspiring to commit a
violation of federal law regulating controlled substances, here a conspiracy to
violate Title 21, United States Code, § 841.  The offence is punishable
by a minimum of 10 years' imprisonment, and where there has been a prior
conviction on a drug offence by 20 years' imprisonment.

 

                   The United States
formally requested the extradition of the respondent in a diplomatic note on
November 5, 1991.  A warrant for his arrest was issued and an extradition
hearing was held before Chilcott J. of the Ontario Court (General Division). 
The appellant relied on affidavit evidence to establish its case for the
extradition of the respondent.  The primary evidence was the affidavits of the
co‑conspirators Mousseau and Herman.  On May 15, 1992, the judge
dismissed the application for committal, and discharged the respondent.  Leave
to appeal to this Court was then sought and granted.  Following the hearing,
the Court, for reasons to follow, allowed the appeal, set aside the judge's
order and directed him to commit the fugitive for surrender.

 

                   Chilcott J. had
dismissed the application for committal on the basis of the threshold issue
that the United States had no jurisdiction to prosecute the offence charged. 
That was because, in his view, there was no evidence that the acts pursuant to
the conspiracy charged were intended to produce detrimental effects in the
United States or that there was any substantive link between the conspiracy and
the United States.  In understanding his reasons, however, it is important to
underline his approach to the conspiracy charged.  He appears to have thought
the conspiracy in the indictment was related solely to activities that had
taken place in the State of Pennsylvania.  He sought links to that state alone,
rather than links to the United States as a whole.  As he put the issue:  ""The
question to be answered is whether there is a significant enough portion of the
activities constituting the offence committed in the State of Pennsylvania, in
the United States of America to give it jurisdiction over the offence."" 
His later conclusions concerning the sufficiency of the evidence are quite
consistent with this.  For example, in the course of discussing that issue, he
notes that the evidence ""involves the respondent in the (New York
deal)"", which ""keeping in mind the purpose for which the (New York
deal) was originated and initiated and the active participation of the
respondent in that venture that the respondent is a party to the main
conspiracy"".  Again he observes that ""the main conspiracy or
agreement was entered into elsewhere than at Allentown, in the State of
Pennsylvania"".  Since he determined the issue of jurisdiction only by
reference to the links to Pennsylvania, his conclusion that ""[t]here is no
real and substantial link between the offence and the requesting state"" is
not inconsistent with his other conclusion regarding the matter of evidence
about which he states:  ""[t]here is sufficient admissible evidence to
establish that the fugitive was part of a conspiracy, but the conspiracy of
which he was a member was not the one set out in the . . . 
Indictment of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania . . ."".

 

                   I should
immediately observe that I respectfully disagree with the extradition judge's
approach to the jurisdictional issue.  What one is concerned with in
extradition is whether the crime was committed in the territory or jurisdiction
of the requesting state, here the United States, not the jurisdiction (perhaps
more appropriately described as venue) of the particular court that may be
seized with the matter; see Extradition Treaty Between Canada and the United
States of America, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, Art. 1.  That approach seems to me
to be even more compelling in the case of a federal offence, like the one in
question here, where the whole of the United States is the appropriate jurisdiction. 
The specification in the indictment that the offence is alleged to have
occurred in Allentown in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is presumably
there to ground jurisdiction for the purposes of domestic United States law in
the court of that district, but one cannot ignore the reference to the fact
that the offence charged includes activities that take place
""elsewhere"".  And as will become apparent later, there were
sufficient acts committed in other parts of the United States to give that
country jurisdiction, at least in accordance with the Canadian law on the
subject.  I leave aside for the moment whether there might even have been
sufficient links in the State of Pennsylvania to support jurisdiction on that
ground.  For I wish now to turn to the issue on which the appellant grounded
its appeal, namely, whether an extradition judge has jurisdiction to entertain
any of those questions.

 

                   Counsel for the
appellant argued that an extradition judge simply is not vested with authority
to consider whether the requesting state has jurisdiction over the offence
charged.  The primary responsibility of that judge under s. 18(1)(b) of
the Extradition Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23, he added, was to determine
whether such evidence has been produced as would, according to Canadian law,
justify the committal of the fugitive for trial if the crime had been committed
in Canada.  The whole matter of the jurisdiction of the requesting state, he
maintained, fell outside the ambit of the extradition judge's function. 
Assuming, which he denied, that the extradition judge had any role to play in
considering the requesting state's jurisdiction to prosecute, it could only be
in terms of fitting the facts constituting the offence into the Canadian legal
framework in the course of performing his task of determining whether the acts
charged would constitute a crime according to the law of Canada ‑‑
a type of ""mirror image"" approach under which only the specific acts
that took place in the United States would be considered to have taken place in
Canada.

 

                   I state immediately
that I am fully in agreement with counsel's submission that an extradition
judge is not vested with the function of considering the jurisdiction of the
requesting state to prosecute the offence.  As this Court has repeatedly
stated, the judge's role under s. 18(1)(b) of the Act is the modest one
of determining whether such evidence is produced as would justify the
fugitive's committal for trial under Canadian law if the crime had been
committed in Canada; see, for example, Argentina v. Mellino, [1987] 1
S.C.R. 536, at p. 553.  If such evidence has been produced, the judge must
commit the fugitive for surrender; otherwise the judge must discharge him. 
There is nothing in the Act that requires the judge to consider where the acts
charged took place, or the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  The issue of
the jurisdiction of the requesting state and its organs to prosecute a crime is
essentially a matter governed by the law of that state.  And the decision of
this Court in McVey (Re); McVey v. United States of America, [1992] 3
S.C.R. 475, at p. 529, (a case, it should be said, that had not been decided at
the time of the extradition hearing in the present case) makes it clear that
""the extradition judge `is not concerned with foreign law at all'"". 
The difficulties and delays inherent in a judge's examining issues of foreign
law are fully set forth in McVey, at p. 528, and I need not repeat
them.  I need only say that, if anything, the determination of the jurisdiction
of a foreign state by a judge unfamiliar with the relevant law seems to me to
be an even more thorny task than a determination of the substantive law of that
state.

 

                   At all events, that
is not what s. 18(1)(b) calls upon the extradition judge to do.  What it
mandates is that the judge determine whether the evidence produced establishes
a prima facie case that would justify committal for trial ""if
the crime had been committed in Canada"" (emphasis added).  McVey
has held that the determination of an extradition crime is conduct based.  The
question to be asked, then, is whether, if the impugned acts or conduct had
been committed in Canada, they would constitute a crime here; see McVey,
at pp. 536 and 541.  It is not whether, if some of the conduct had been
committed here and some abroad, it would be a crime here.  Like the extradition
judge, I have no doubt that the acts charged, if committed in Canada, would be
a crime here.  The so-called ""double criminality rule"" has thus been
met.  There is no need, and in my view, it would be wrong, to adopt the
""mirror image"" concept.  All the Act requires is that the act or
conduct with which the fugitive is charged would be an extradition crime ""if
the crime [the act or conduct] had been committed in Canada"" (emphasis
added).  This is entirely in keeping with the underlying reason for the double
criminality rule that no one in Canada shall be surrendered for prosecution
outside this country for behaviour that does not amount to a crime in this
country.

 

                   The double
criminality rule (coupled with the doctrine of ""specialty"" which
prohibits the requesting state from prosecuting for crimes other than that for
which the extradition took place) are the procedures adopted by the high
contracting parties to protect the individual.  This type of duty is assigned
to the courts.  The issue of whether a state has gone beyond the terms of the
treaty in exercising jurisdiction is a matter between states.  The question
whether a requesting state has a legitimate interest in prosecuting a fugitive
is primarily an issue for the appropriate authorities in the foreign state.  As
it was put in McVey, at p. 549:

 

. . .
the act must be a crime in the requesting country.  Why would it prosecute otherwise? 
That originally is a matter for the prosecuting authorities and ultimately for
the courts of the demanding state, here the United States.  Similarly,
officials in the State Department in the United States must conclude that the
act charged falls within the treaty according to the laws of that country. 
They are unfamiliar with our laws.  The requested state will naturally wish to
monitor the treaty to ensure that its obligations are engaged, and for that
purpose the requesting state is required by the treaty to supply documentation
enabling the requested state to do so.

 

                   As noted in the
passage just cited, there is a role for Canada in monitoring compliance with
that treaty, but that role is not one for the courts.  It is one for the
executive as McVey makes clear, at p. 551:

 

The
issue of whether the act charged was a crime under United States law was for
the prosecutors in the United States to decide, and it was for them and the
U.S. State Department to assess whether in their view it came within the
treaty, subject to monitoring by Canada pursuant to the treaty.  The
monitoring task has not, for good reason, been assigned to the extradition
judge, so it remains with the executive.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Support for this approach may also be
found in Sinclair v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1991] 2 All E.R.
366 (H.L.), at pp. 383-84, where Lord Ackner in examining the respective roles
of the extradition judge and the executive in giving effect to the treaty
discussed the recent cases, including Schtraks v. Government of Israel,
[1964] A.C. 556, at p. 579, where the extradition judge relied on the
executive's view of what constituted the ""territory"" of the
requesting state, and concluded, at p. 384:  ""Mr. Jones [the counsel for
the prosecution] is thus supported in his contention that monitoring the
provisions of the treaty is an executive, and not a magisterial, function""
(emphasis added).

 

                   This approach is
entirely consistent with the terms of the Treaty.  Thus Art. 3(3) specifies the
executive as the authority to consider the jurisdiction of the requesting state
over crimes committed outside its territory.  It reads:

 

                                                            Article
3

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(3)                      When
the offense for which extradition has been requested has been committed outside
the territory of the requesting State, the executive or other appropriate
authority of the requested State shall have the power to grant the extradition
if the laws of the requested State provide for jurisdiction over such an
offense committed in similar circumstances.

 

The power set forth in this provision
can be assigned to other appropriate bodies, but there is no provision giving
the court that power in the Extradition Act  or otherwise.  In
considering this matter, the extradition judge was usurping the function of the
executive.  I am aware, of course, that extradition judges have in the past
considered whether the requesting state had jurisdiction over the offence
charged, but that was at a time preceding Sinclair and McVey, supra,
and other cases that have clarified the limited role of the extradition judge.

 

                   That is sufficient
to dispose of the case.  However, even assuming the extradition judge had
authority under the Extradition Act  to consider jurisdiction on the
""reverse image"" approach, I would come to the conclusion that the
fugitive should be surrendered.  For if only the specific acts committed in the
United States had been committed in Canada, it would constitute a crime in
Canada over which jurisdiction would be exercisable under Canadian law.  The
refurbishing of the plane took place in Florida, as did the agreement to do so
and to fly it to Colombia to pick up drugs for delivery in Nova Scotia.  That
would in itself be sufficient to ground jurisdiction.  Section 465(3)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , provides that a person who conspires with
anyone to commit a crime outside Canada shall be deemed to have conspired to do
so in Canada, and s. 465(4)  provides for the converse situation.  But this was
by no means all the relevant overt acts.  The plane took off from a point in
Florida, landed at other areas in that state and in Georgia.  As well, the New
York City Deal was taken as a step in advancing the overall conspiracy (the
Airplane Deal).  All of these acts taken together are quite sufficient overt
acts in the United States, even apart from what occurred in Allentown, to
constitute a ""real and substantial link"" to the United States as
described by this Court in Libman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178, at
p. 213.  In that case, the accused conducted a fraudulent telephone sales
solicitation scheme in Toronto from which United States residents were called
with a view to defraud them by selling them stocks in a Costa Rica company, for
which the purchase price was paid either in the United States or Costa Rica. 
This Court held that there were sufficient connections to permit prosecution in
Canada.  As is earlier indicated, the extradition judge would have come to the
same conclusion had he not focussed wholly on the activities in Allentown, a
matter related, as I have indicated earlier, more to the jurisdiction of the
particular court (a matter par excellence of United States law) than to
the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  Indeed this amounted to an
interpretation of the indictment, also a matter of United States law.

 

                   I should add that
perhaps more significance should be attached to what occurred in Allentown than
the judge gave it.  The landing in Allentown was, we saw, described as an
""unscheduled stop"", but there is some evidence that the landing might
have been intended to serve the purpose of refuelling.  Apart from this, in
conspiring to fly drugs from Colombia to Nova Scotia, it must have been
intended that the necessary steps be taken, including making stopovers if need
be.  In considering this stopover, it should not be overlooked that the taking
of the drugs into Allentown would constitute the offence of possessing illicit
drugs there.  In considering this matter, it is well to take cognizance of the
real nature of drug trafficking and other transnational crimes.  The following
sentiments expressed by Lord Griffiths in Liangsiriprasert v. United States
Government, [1990] 2 All E.R. 866 (P.C.), at p. 878, are apt here:

 

                   Unfortunately
in this century crime has ceased to be largely local in origin and effect. 
Crime is now established on an international scale and the common law must face
this new reality.  Their Lordships can find nothing in precedent, comity or
good sense that should inhibit the common law from regarding as justiciable in
England inchoate crimes committed abroad which are intended to result in the
commission of criminal offences in England.

 

                   To conclude, I am
of the view that the judge should not have considered the issue of
territoriality or jurisdiction at all.  That is a matter for the executive, as
contemplated by the Treaty.  There is nothing in the Extradition Act 
that gives the extradition judge any power to deal with the matter, his sole
authority being to consider whether there is sufficient evidence (which he held
there was here) to constitute the crime if it had been committed in Canada. 
Even if the judge were vested with the authority, the facts of this case amply
fulfil the requirement of real and substantial connection under the test set
forth in Libman.

 

                   These reasons, in
my view, fully support the judgment given at the conclusion of the hearing in
this Court, namely:  ""The appeal is allowed.  The order discharging the
respondent is set aside and the matter is remitted to the extradition judge
with a direction to commit the respondent.""

 

                   The reasons of
Sopinka and Iacobucci JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Sopinka
J. -- I agree with the
conclusion of my colleague, Justice La Forest, that the appeal should be
allowed and an order of committal issued.  I would do so solely on the ground
that the extradition judge ought to have found that if the situation were
reversed and the conduct which occurred in the United States occurred in
Canada, there would be a real and substantial connection to Canada so as to
found jurisdiction over the offence.  My colleague and I are not in
disagreement that this is a determination that must be made, but only as to who
should make it.  My colleague says that it should be the executive, while I am
of the opinion that this is a question of mixed law and fact which is part and
parcel of the determination that an extradition judge must make under the Extradition
Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-23 (the ""Act"") that a prima facie
case has been made out that, if the crime were committed in Canada, a committal
for trial would be justified.

 

                   I stress at the
outset that there is nothing in the reasons of the majority in McVey (Re);
McVey v. United States of America, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 475, that resolves this
issue.  That case decided that the decision by the extradition judge was
""conduct based"" in that the judge was not empowered to consider
foreign law so as to determine whether the conduct was an offence in the
requesting state.  It followed that it was not part of the judge's function to
determine whether the offence was listed in the Treaty under its foreign
label.  At page 526, La Forest J. described the resulting function of the
extradition judge as follows:   

 

That
function is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence that a fugitive
accused has committed an act in the requesting state that would, if committed
in Canada, constitute a Canadian crime listed or described in the treaty.

 

                   A review of the
Treaty (Extradition Treaty Between Canada and the United States of America,
Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3) and the Act supports the conclusion that this is a matter
which is appropriately resolved in a judicial proceeding rather than by
executive fiat.  Moreover, there are strong policy reasons in favour of this
position.  Furthermore, as my colleague points out, the practice in Canada has
been for the extradition judge to consider jurisdiction over the offence.  I
respectfully disagree that there is any justification for a change in this
practice by reason of the decisions in Sinclair v. Director of Public
Prosecutions, [1991] 2 All E.R. 366 (H.L.), or McVey, supra.

 

                   With the exception
of Art. 4(1)(iii) dealing with offences of a political nature, the Treaty does
not specify by whom extradition issues are to be determined.  Rather, this is
left to the laws of the contracting states.  Thus, Art. 8 provides:

 

                                                            Article
8

 

                   The
determination that extradition should or should not be granted shall be made in
accordance with the law of the requested State and the person whose extradition
is sought shall have the right to use all remedies and recourses provided by
such law.  

 

                   While Art. 1
restricts extradition to those who have been convicted or are charged with an
offence committed within the respective territories of the parties, and Art. 10
specifies that extradition is only to be granted if under the laws of the
requested state the fugitive would be committed for trial, determination of
these matters is left to the laws of the requested state.  Article 3(3), to
which my colleague refers, does not, as suggested, specify that it is the
executive that must decide the issue in question.  I reproduce the sub-article
for ease of reference:  

 

                                                            Article
3

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(3) 
When the offense for which extradition has been requested has been committed
outside the territory of the requesting State, the executive or other
appropriate authority of the requested State shall have the power to grant
the extradition if the laws of the requested State provide for jurisdiction
over such an offense committed in similar circumstances.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The underlined words make it clear
that, in keeping with the general tenor of the Treaty, it is left to the
domestic law of the requested state to determine whether the executive or other
appropriate authority is to make this decision.  During oral argument, counsel
for the appellant conceded that if this Court were to determine that an
extradition judge had the authority to consider the issue of jurisdiction, then
he or she would ""certainly be the other appropriate authority""
pursuant to Art. 3(3).  The Treaty is, therefore, neutral on the issue before us,
although what is clear is that, whoever is the decision-maker, the ""mirror
image"" approach is to be adopted.  Accordingly, the decision-maker must
consider whether in similar circumstances under Canadian law our courts would
assume jurisdiction over the offence.  This mixed question of law and fact
would require the decision-maker to consider the evidence as to where the acts
took place, make findings in that regard and apply the law of Canada which
would include s. 6(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and
cases of which the most recent is Libman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
178.

 

                   Turning to the Act,
there is only one specific provision that confers a power on the executive and
that is s. 22 which confers a discretion to refuse extradition for political
crimes.  Nonetheless, the enforcement of Treaty obligations is left to the
parties to the Treaty unless under domestic law an appropriate authority is
designated.  In my opinion, ss. 13 and 18(1)(b) of the Act considered in
the context of the Act as a whole, are a sufficient designation to constitute
the extradition judge the appropriate authority to decide this question. 
Section 13 directs that when a fugitive is brought before a judge the case is
to be dealt with, as nearly as possible, ""as if the fugitive was brought
before a justice of the peace, charged with an indictable offence"".  Our
Court has held that this provision, in combination with other provisions of the
Act, determines the standard of proof at a preliminary hearing.  See United
States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067.  Section 18(1)(b)
goes on to provide that the judge is to issue a committal order if ""such
evidence is produced as would, according to the law of Canada . . . justify the
committal of the fugitive for trial, if the crime had been committed in
Canada""/  In considering whether a crime has been committed in Canada, a
judge at a preliminary hearing would, in any case with transnational aspects,
consider whether the crime was committed outside of Canada and beyond the
jurisdiction of the court by virtue of s. 6(2)  of the Criminal Code .  Libman
has interpreted this provision to mean that there must be a real and
substantial connection to Canada of the alleged acts constituting the offence
in order to give jurisdiction to a Canadian court.  

 

                   The extradition
judge, therefore, would appear to be the forum that is eminently suited to
determine the issue mandated by Art. 3(3) of the Treaty.  The alternative is to
relegate its determination to the executive in some unspecified proceeding for
which no provision is made either in the Treaty or the Act.  Presumably, in
order to determine a mixed question of law and fact, some kind of a hearing
would have to be held in order to comply with the rules of fairness and the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  No provision is made for such a hearing
and its nature and form would have to be judicially invented.  This would mean
that there would be two hearings instead of one and an issue that is
conveniently dealt with in one proceeding would be bifurcated.  

 

                   There are other
valid reasons to support the interpretation of the Act that would leave this
question to the decision of a judge rather than the executive.  First, this
approach is more consistent with the scheme of distribution of the respective
functions of the executive and the judiciary embodied in the Act.  Second, this
approach respects the rights of the individual, a purpose that was recognized
as an important one by our Court and which weighed heavily in justifying
extradition as a reasonable limit on the Charter  right to remain in
Canada set out in s. 6(1)  thereof.

 

                   In McVey, La
Forest J. explained the rationale underlying the allocation of functions in the
Act.  At page 519, he stated:  

 

In
essence, the treaty obligations are of a political character to be dealt with
in the absence of statute by the political authorities.  However, as Laskin J.
noted in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228,
at p. 245, the liberty of the individual has not been forgotten in these
rather special proceedings.  The treaties, sensitive to the liberty of the
individual, contain provisions for their protection.  Most important is the
requirement that there be prima facie evidence that the act charged
would constitute a crime in Canada.  This specific matter, about which
judges are most competent, is the task assigned to a judge by the Extradition
Act ....  Barring statutory provision, the task of dealing with
international treaty obligations is for the political authorities, and is
performed by the Ministers and departments in the course of fulfilling their
appropriate mandates.  The Extradition Act , of course, gives the
Minister of Justice authority respecting the surrender of a fugitive; see ss.
20  - 22  and 25 .  The treaty terms are aimed at the obligations of the parties
and not the internal procedures by which these are to be carried into effect. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   In assessing the
content of the proceedings before the extradition judge designed for the
protection of the individual, it seems unusual to excise a part which is the
daily fare of a provincial court judge presiding over a preliminary hearing and
which, until recently, was dealt with by extradition judges.  It is surely a
matter in respect of which judges are especially competent and for which the
executive is ill-equipped.  Indeed, it has been forcefully argued that it is to
judges that we should look for protection against the excessive exercise of
jurisdiction by foreign states.  In La Forest's Extradition to and from
Canada (3rd ed. 1991), at pp. 55-56, the learned author, Anne La Forest,
states:  

 

                   Before
the extradition of an accused fugitive will be granted, the act charged must
have been committed within the jurisdiction of the demanding country.  In
practice, this usually means its territory, which is of course by far the most
common basis of criminal jurisdiction.  States are only interested in
prohibiting acts abroad to the extent that they affect matters within their own
territory.  Further, states are reluctant to interfere with matters that more
naturally fall within the territory of another state.  Probably because of
this, some extradition treaties, including the most recent ones, provide for
the surrender of fugitives who have committed crimes within the ""territory""
of the demanding state.  Others, however, do speak of
""jurisdiction"".  Whether this makes any difference is not entirely
clear. . . .  Moreover, the courts, as part of the territoriality principle,
will hold acts having a real and substantial connection with a state as having
been committed there even though the conduct itself may have been committed
outside its territory. . . .  Courts in the requested state could
possibly act against excessive exercises of jurisdiction by other states in
various ways; for example, by holding that the acts complained of would not be
a crime in the requested state, and so not be an extradition crime. 
[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

 

                   Finally, on this
point, I observe that there is no concern here that judges will become embroiled
in the lengthy and murky issue of deciding foreign law which was thought to be
a problem by the majority in McVey.

 

                   For many years,
this Court has stressed that the scheme of the Act demonstrates a special
concern for individual liberty as against foreign claims for surrender.  In Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico v. Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, Laskin J. (as he then
was) stated, at p. 245:

 

                   I
have referred to the scheme of the Act (and it is the same scheme that we have
had for some one hundred years) in order to emphasize the special character of
extradition proceedings and the concern shown for the liberty of persons in
Canada as against foreign claims for their surrender, supported by provisions
for habeas corpus in favour of the fugitive and without rights of appeal
or review otherwise.    

 

This theme was picked up by La Forest
J. in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500.  Speaking for the
majority, which included Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre and Le Dain JJ., he
stated, at p. 515:  

 

                   However,
as Laskin J. (as he then was) noted in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez . . . concern for the liberty of the individual has not been
overlooked in these rather special proceedings.  That is why provision is made
in the treaties and in the Extradition Act  to ensure that, before the
discretion to surrender can be exercised, a judicial hearing must be held for
the purpose of determining whether there is such evidence of the crime alleged
to have been committed in the foreign country as would, according to the law of
Canada, justify his or her committal for trial if it had been committed here. 
If so, the judge commits the fugitive for surrender, and the executive may then
exercise its discretion to surrender; if not, he or she is discharged (s. 18 of
the Act).  The hearing is similar to a preliminary hearing, the presiding judge
being ordained by s. 13 of the Act to hear the case in the same manner,
""as nearly as may be"", as at a preliminary hearing for a crime
committed in this country.  

 

                   The existence of
these provisions for the protection of the liberty of the individual was a
substantial factor in the decision of the majority in upholding the
constitutional validity of the Act in United States of America v. Cotroni,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469.  Dealing with the issue of proportionality, La Forest J.
concluded that the right to remain in Canada guaranteed by s. 6(1)  of the Charter 
was infringed ""as little as reasonably possible"".  In coming to this
conclusion he stated, at p. 1490:  

 

Furthermore,
as is indicated in Canada v. Schmidt, supra, extradition
practices have been tailored as much as possible for the protection of the
liberty of the individual.  It accords the same kinds of rights (though in
a necessarily attenuated form) as are afforded to an accused under ss. 7  and 11 
of the Charter .  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Furthermore, in
answer to the argument of counsel for the appellant El Zein that too much
discretion was given to the executive, La Forest J. stated, at
pp. 1499-1500:

 

There
is, it is true, some discretion in the federal government under the treaties to
refuse surrender, for example, where the crime is one of a political
character.  There may, as well, be cases where the government, for high
political purposes or for the protection of an accused, may be prepared not to
conform with a treaty.  But this executive discretion would rarely be exercised
and is impossible to define in the abstract.  That is scarcely surprising.  The
extradition process is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational
considerations.  As was noted in Canada v. Schmidt, supra, at p.
515, the procedure is tailored with an eye to the liberty of the individual. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   I am concerned that
having sustained the Act on this basis we must be careful not to chip away at
what was stressed as the principal protection for the liberty of the
individual, namely, a judicial hearing with respect to issues that impinge on
those rights involving questions of mixed law and fact of the kind that are
best decided by a judge.  It seems inconsistent with the approach to the
interpretation of the Act propounded in Cotroni stressing the importance
of the hearing to the rights of the individual and then to proceed to interpret
the content of that hearing as ever-increasingly ""modest"".

 

                   My colleague finds
some support for his approach in Sinclair v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
supra, which in turn relied on Schtraks v. Government of Israel,
[1964] A.C. 556.  I make two observations.  First, neither of these cases
addresses the issue in this case.  Second, to the extent that the language in
the cases supports a narrowing of the judicial role and expansion of that of
the executive, it cannot be transplanted to Canada where the provisions of our
Act are designed to protect ""as much as possible"" the rights of the
individual which are guaranteed by a charter of rights and freedoms.

 

                   In Sinclair,
there were two issues arising out of a request for extradition by the United
States addressed to the United Kingdom and based on the Treaty between them: 
(i) could the magistrate order a stay of proceedings because the extradition
constituted an abuse of the process; and (ii) could the magistrate decide that
a time limit on extradition had lapsed.  Lord Ackner decided that the first
issue was beyond the jurisdiction of the magistrate.  He also held that the
magistrate could not consider foreign law in order to determine whether the
requesting state had complied with the Treaty before submitting its request. 
On the other hand, he concluded that the magistrate was right in determining
that relevant provisions of the Treaty did not apply.  In so far as Lord Ackner
relied on Schtraks in determining the respective roles of the executive
and the judiciary, it is not readily apparent that the case addresses this
point.  The issue was whether Jerusalem was part of the territory of Israel
within the meaning of the Treaty between the governments of Israel and the
United Kingdom.  The extradition magistrate relied at least in part on a letter
from the Foreign Office that Her Majesty's Government recognized that Israel
had de facto authority over Jerusalem.  The issue as to whether the
magistrate was correct in his determination that Jerusalem was within the
territory of Israel was answered in the affirmative.  There is nothing to
suggest that this issue was beyond his jurisdiction or that the decision was
for the executive.  It is one thing for a court to rely on the executive
regarding the existence of a foreign state or the extent of its territory.  It
is quite another to hold that action that has taken place partially within and
partially outside that territory should fall within the jurisdiction of that
state for the purpose of an extradition treaty.  See Duff Development Co. v.
Government of Kelantan, [1924] A.C. 797; Taylor v. Barclay (1828), 2
Sim. 213, 57 E.R. 769; and Chateau-Gai Wines Ltd. v. Attorney General of
Canada, [1970] Ex. C.R. 366.  

 

                   Finally, I should
point out that if my colleague is right on the first issue and the extradition
judge was not empowered to deal with jurisdiction over the offence, a matter
exclusively within the authority of the executive, then this Court has no
jurisdiction to make that determination.  This is an appeal from the decision
of the extradition judge and we can only make any order that he ought to have
made.  If he was without authority to find jurisdiction over the offence we are
similarly limited.  See s. 45 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. S-26 .  That determination must be made by the executive and, until
made, the surrender cannot be made in compliance with the Treaty.

 

                   I would dispose of
the appeal as proposed by La Forest J.

                   Sopinka J. ‑‑ This is an appeal as

                   Having heard the
appellant on the merits, however, we are of the view that, even if the Court

                   The accused was charged
with aggravated assault in connection with a stabbing which occurred during a
fight.  At trial, the accused admitted punching the victim several times but
testified that he fled when he saw S, another person on the scene, stab the
victim in the back.  The defence adduced evidence connecting S with a previous
stabbing, which had occurred a short distance away earlier that evening, and
evidence showing that S had a criminal record for break and enter, theft,
breach of probation, and armed robbery during which a gun and a knife were
wielded.  In his testimony, S denied both stabbings and being armed during the
armed robbery.  Several witnesses to the fight corroborated the accused's
version of the events but it was the Crown's theory that those witnesses, all
of whom were friends of the accused, fabricated their stories in order to place
the blame for the stabbing on S.  The trial judge instructed the jury that S's
criminal record was relevant to the issue of his credibility as a witness.  He
also instructed the jury that the evidence of the accused's flight was a factor
to be considered in reaching their verdict but that this evidence was not
conclusive as innocent people sometimes flee the scene of a crime.  Defence
counsel at trial did not object to the trial judge's charge on these issues. 
The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and his conviction was affirmed
by a majority of the Court of Appeal.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   The trial judge
failed to charge the jury properly with respect to the use that could be made
of the evidence adduced by the accused concerning S's bad character or
propensity for violence.  The evidence of S's previous conviction for armed
robbery and his connection with the first stabbing incident was sufficiently
probative to warrant its admission and use for the purpose of establishing that
S had wielded a knife in the past and was therefore likely to have stabbed the
victim.  The trial judge's instructions that the jury could consider S's
criminal record in assessing his credibility as a witness, however, may have
misled the jury into supposing that S's character evidence could not be used as
proof of his disposition.  To avoid any confusion in this case, the trial judge
should have also instructed the jury that if, and to the extent that, they
accepted the evidence of S's character, they were entitled to consider such
evidence in support of the defence theory that there was a reasonable doubt S,
rather than the accused, stabbed the victim.  On the facts of this case, the
jury might not have known that the evidence could be relied upon for that
purpose.  Although defence counsel did not raise this issue before the trial
judge, the defence theory arose naturally and clearly out of the evidence and
the accused was entitled to have the jury charged with respect to it.  If
properly instructed, it is possible that the jury would have had a reasonable
doubt as to the accused's guilt.

 

                   As well, the trial
judge failed to instruct the jury properly regarding the use that could be made
of the evidence of the accused's flight from the scene.  To be useful, flight
must give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt in regard to a
specific offence.  Where an accused's conduct may be equally explained by
reference to consciousness of guilt of two or more offences, and where an
accused has admitted culpability in respect of one or more of these offences, a
trial judge should instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value
with respect to any particular offence.  Any inference to be drawn from flight
disappears when an explanation for such flight is available.  Here, the jury
should have been warned against drawing any inference from the fact of flight. 
The trial judge's direction that even innocent people sometimes flee the scene
of a crime was insufficient in light of the fact that the accused admitted that
he had committed common assault by punching the victim, and thus had reason to
flee.  The trial judge should have instructed the jury that because his flight
was equally consistent with common assault and with aggravated assault, it
could not support an inference of consciousness of guilt with respect to the
latter.  Since she did not charge the jury in those terms, there is a danger that
the jury may have wrongly inferred from the evidence that the accused fled
because of his guilt in stabbing the victim.

 

                   Section 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  is inapplicable in the present case.  There is a
possibility that, but for the trial judge's errors, the jury's verdict would
have been different.  Defence counsel's failure to object to a jury charge is
not determinative of the applicability of the  Code's curative
provision.

Court was delivered by

 

                   Major
J. --  The appellant was
convicted by a judge and jury of aggravated assault in connection with a
stabbing and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  An appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed, Galligan J.A. dissenting. 

 

                   The appellant
appeals as of right on the point of law raised in Galligan J.A.'s dissent,
i.e., whether the trial judge properly instructed the jury regarding evidence
adduced by the accused to the effect that another person at the scene of the
crime had minutes earlier stabbed another person, and therefore was more likely
than the accused to have stabbed the victim.  The appellant was also granted
leave to argue the additional issue of whether the trial judge properly
instructed the jury with respect to the inference to be drawn from the fact
that he ran from the scene of the crime.

 

I.The Facts

 

                   A scuffle occurred
outside Rafferty's, a Scarborough bar, at approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 22,
1991.  One of the participants, Theodore Heffern, tried to escape and was
chased by a number of individuals, including the appellant.  Heffern ran onto
the poorly-lit porch of a neighbouring house.  One member of the pursuing
group, Edward Sweeney, followed him onto the porch and began punching and
kicking him.  The appellant joined the fracas, and admits to having punched
Heffern several times.  When it became apparent that Heffern had been stabbed
in the back, the appellant, Sweeney and a number of witnesses fled the scene. 

 

                   The appellant
admitted common assault but denied aggravated assault, and gave evidence that
he saw a black man, whom he identified as Jason Semester, approach the porch
with a knife, stab Heffern and flee.  

 

                   Heffern testified
that he did not see who stabbed him and that he did not see anyone other than
the appellant and Sweeney on or near the porch at the time of the attack.  He
noted, however, that he had blacked out for approximately 10 seconds during the
incident.

 

                   Semester denied
stabbing Heffern.  He testified that he saw three men, including the victim, on
or near the porch during the assault, but that he did not see anyone being
stabbed.  He also said that there were a number of black men, in addition to
himself, who witnessed the event.

 

                   James Kelly, Todd
Ford and Reginald Nash, who were among the witnesses to the assault on the
porch, testified at trial in support of the appellant's version of the events. 
It was the Crown's theory that those witnesses, all of whom were friends of the
appellant, fabricated their stories in order to place the blame for the
stabbing on Semester.

 

                   Kelly's evidence
was that he saw Semester go up to the porch and stab Heffern.  He also stated
that he had spoken to Semester prior to the attack and that Semester appeared
to be ""buzzed"" or ""high"" on drugs. 

 

                   Ford testified that
a number of black men were present during the assault and that he saw an
individual matching Semester's general description approach the porch, stick his
hand through the porch railing, and then flee.  Ford further testified that he
noticed moments later that the same man was carrying a knife. 

 

                   Nash testified that
while he did not see anyone run up to the porch or stab Heffern, he did see an
individual matching Semester's description, and whom he identified at trial as
being Semester, run away from the porch.  He also claimed that there was only
one black man among the crowd who witnessed the assault and that he heard a
member of the crowd say that Heffern had been stabbed by a black man.  Nash
further testified that an hour after the assault had occurred, he met Semester
who showed him a bloody knife and admitted to the stabbing.  However, when
arrested and charged with aggravated assault in connection with the incident,
Nash did not reveal that information to the police.  At trial, he explained his
silence on the grounds that he did not want to get anyone involved with the
police and that he was afraid that Semester or others would harm him if he implicated
Semester in the stabbing.

 

                   Another witness,
Kerri-Ann Parsons, testified that the only people on or near the porch at the
relevant time were the appellant, Sweeney and Heffern.  Parsons also testified
that while she saw the appellant hunched over the fallen Heffern, she could not
see what he was doing with his arms because his back was to her.  Parsons
stated that she did not see anyone stab Heffern.

 

                   A number of
witnesses stated that the appellant had blood on his right hand after the
incident.  The appellant testified that he was holding Heffern, who was in a
sitting position, around the head with his left arm while punching him with his
right hand when Semester unexpectedly stabbed him in the back.  That evidence
was challenged by the Crown during cross-examination on the ground that it
would not explain how the appellant got blood on his right hand.

 

                   A half hour before
the initial scuffle occurred outside Rafferty's, another stabbing occurred a
short distance away in the parking lot of a Pizza Pizza restaurant.  The
victim, Cameron Day, along with Jim Kelly, the witness who testified on behalf
of the appellant, were involved in a fight.  Kelly's evidence was that he and
Semester had drawn knives during the altercation, but that he did not see Semester,
or anyone else, stab Day. 

 

                   Day testified that
he was involved in a fist fight with a white man when a black man, who he could
not identify by photograph, intervened and struck him in the stomach; he later
realized that he had been stabbed by the intervener.  Day did not get a good
look at the person who stabbed him and gave a description of the assailant that
was not entirely consistent with Semester's appearance.  Day also testified
that he did not see anyone wield a knife during the incident.

 

                   William Cowan, a
friend of Day's, testified that he saw a white man and a black man involved in
an altercation with Day.  However, he did not get a good look at the black man,
nor could he make a photographic identification.  Cowan did not see anyone
wield a knife during the altercation.

 

                   Semester testified
that he and a number of other black men were present during the incident but
denied ever carrying a knife or stabbing Day.

 

                   Finally, evidence
was led to show that Semester had a criminal record for break and enter, theft,
breach of probation, and armed robbery during which a gun and a knife were
wielded.  With respect to the last conviction, he gave evidence that he merely
accompanied the individuals who committed the robbery and that he was unarmed
at the time.

 

II.The
Courts Below

 

The Trial Court

 

                   The trial judge
instructed the jury that appellant's criminal record was relevant only to the
issue of his credibility as a witness.  She similarly confined the evidence of
Semester's criminal record, which included a crime of violence, to the issue of
credibility.  The jurors were not told that they could also consider Semester's
criminal record, together with the evidence connecting him with the stabbing of
Day, as supporting the appellant's contention that Semester had a propensity
for violence and had stabbed Heffern.  If accepted, that evidence could have
supported the appellant's version of the events and raised a reasonable doubt
as to his guilt. 

 

                   The trial judge
also instructed the jury that the evidence of the appellant's flight was a
factor to be considered in reaching their verdict.  However, she clearly stated
that that evidence was not conclusive as innocent people sometimes flee the
scene of a crime.

 

                   Defence counsel at
trial did not object to the fact that the trial judge's charge dealt with
Semester's criminal record only in connection with the issue of credibility and
did not comment at all upon the use that could be made of the evidence tying
Semester to the earlier stabbing of Day.  Similarly, counsel did not object to
the jury charge with respect to the instruction given regarding the inference
to be drawn from the appellant's flight from the scene. 

 

The Court of Appeal for Ontario

 

                   A majority of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal: (1993), 18 W.C.B. (2d) 270. 
Brooke and Labrosse JJ.A. considered but rejected the submission that the trial
judge erred in not instructing the jury that the evidence of Semester's
criminal record and his connection with the stabbing of Day within the half
hour of the stabbing of Heffern could have probative value to show that he was
likely to have stabbed Heffern.  The majority noted that no objection had been
taken to the charge at trial, and stated that it was implicit in the jury's
verdict that they accepted the evidence of Semester denying involvement and
rejected the evidence of the appellant.  They concluded that the jury would not
have reached a different verdict had they been charged as now requested by the
appellant.

 

                   In dissent,
Galligan J.A. stated that even in the absence of a request by the defence, the
trial judge should have charged the jury that if they believed the evidence
regarding Semester's involvement in the stabbing of Day, then they would be
entitled to consider that evidence as tending to support the appellant's
testimony that it was Semester who stabbed Heffern. 

 

                   The inference if
any to be drawn from the appellant's flight from the scene of the stabbing was
not commented upon by the Court of Appeal.

 

III.Points
in Issue

 

                   This appeal raises
three issues:

 

(1)  Was the majority of the Ontario
Court of Appeal correct in holding that the trial judge had not erred in
failing to instruct the jury that if they accepted evidence that indicated
Semester had wielded a knife in the past, they could consider that evidence as
supporting the appellant's contention that it was Semester, and not he, who
stabbed Heffern?

 

(2)  Did the Ontario Court of Appeal
err in not holding that the trial judge had failed to properly instruct the
jury with respect to the inference to be drawn from the fact that the appellant
fled from the scene of the stabbing?

 

(3)  If the trial judge was in error,
can the error(s) be cured by s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ?

 

IV.Analysis

 

A.The
Issue of Semester's Past Conduct

 

                   In her charge to
the jury, the trial judge referred to the evidence of Semester's criminal
record and instructed the jury that they could consider that evidence in
assessing his credibility as a witness and in determining the weight to be
given to his evidence.  She did not, however, instruct them that Semester's
conviction for robbery during which a knife and a gun were used, and the
evidence, if accepted, of his involvement in the stabbing of Day earlier that
evening, could support the appellant's contention that it was Semester who
stabbed Heffern.

 

                   There are limits on
the introduction and use of evidence during a criminal trial.  Though relevant,
evidence may be excluded on policy grounds.  Illustrative of that is the
well-known instruction on character evidence that ""the Crown is not
permitted to adduce evidence of the accused's bad character either by evidence
of reputation or specific acts unless the accused has put character in issue or
the evidence is otherwise relevant to an issue, as for instance as evidence of
similar acts"": J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, The Law of
Evidence in Canada (1992), at p. 454.  While such evidence may be relevant,
it is excluded on the grounds that its prejudicial effect is apt to outweigh
its probative value; the danger exists that a jury may convict on the basis of
the accused's reputation rather than on the basis of the evidence: McCormick
on Evidence (4th ed. 1992), vol. 1, § 190, at p. 811.

 

                   However, the danger
of a wrongful conviction does not arise where the character evidence pertains
not to the accused, but to a third party witness.  Consequently, ""[s]o
long as it is relevant and not otherwise excluded by a rule of evidence,
evidence of the bad character of a third party can be adduced by the defence"":
Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, supra, at p. 467; R. v. Scopelliti
(1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.); and Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed.
1940), vol. 1, § 139, at p. 573.  The Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed this in
R. v. McMillan (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160, aff'd [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824. 
There, the accused was charged with murdering his child.  His defence was that
his wife had killed the child.  The Court of Appeal held that the accused was
permitted to adduce evidence that his wife suffered from a psychopathic
personality disorder and had committed acts of violence in the past in order to
establish that she had a disposition to commit the offence in question.

 

                   However, evidence
of a third party's bad character will not be admitted unless it is relevant. 
There would be no probative value in evidence that a third party had a
propensity to commit the type of act in question if he was otherwise
unconnected with the circumstances surrounding the charge, R. v. McMillan,
supra, at p. 168, per Martin J.A:

 

                          Obviously,
unless the third person is connected with the crime under consideration by
other circumstances, evidence of such person's disposition to commit the
offence is inadmissible on the grounds of lack of probative value.  For
example, if A is charged with murdering X, in the absence of some nexus with
the alleged offence, evidence that B has a propensity or disposition for
violence, by itself, is inadmissible to prove B is the murderer because
standing alone it has no probative value with respect to the probability of B
having committed the offence.  If, however, it is proved that A, B and X all
lived in the same house when X was killed, and that B had a motive to kill X,
then evidence that B had a propensity for violence, may have probative value on
the issue whether B, and not A, killed X, and is accordingly admissible.

 

See also McMillan v. The Queen,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, at p. 828; and R. v. Williams (1985), 18 C.C.C.
(3d) 356 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 366. 

 

                   In Scopelliti,
supra, the accused was charged with murder.  He testified that he acted
in self-defence, and sought to lead evidence of the deceased's character or
disposition for violence to support his contention that the deceased was the
aggressor.  Martin J.A. stated at p. 496:

 

                   I
agree, of course, that evidence of previous acts of violence by the deceased,
not known to the accused, must be confined to evidence of previous acts of
violence which may legitimately and reasonably assist the jury in arriving at a
just verdict with respect to the accused's claim of self-defence.  To exclude,
however, evidence offered by the accused which is relevant to prove his
innocence would not, in my view, be in the interests of justice.

 

                   Since
evidence of prior acts of violence by the deceased is likely to arouse feelings
of hostility against the deceased, there must inevitably be some element of
discretion in the determination whether the proffered evidence has sufficient
probative value for the purpose for which it is tendered to justify its
admission.  Moreover, great care must be taken to ensure that such evidence, if
admitted, is not misused.

 

See also R. v. Yaeck (1991), 68
C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 563, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
[1992] 1 S.C.R. xii; and R. v. McMillan, supra, at p. 167.

 

                   The proposition is
unquestioned that evidence which is logically probative may be excluded where
its probative value is slight but its prejudicial effect upon the fair trial of
the accused is great.   However, courts are reluctant to exclude evidence
offered by an accused in his defence: R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R.
577, per McLachlin J., at p. 611:

 

Canadian
courts, like courts in most common law jurisdictions, have been extremely
cautious in restricting the power of the accused to call evidence in his or her
defence, a reluctance founded in the fundamental tenet of our judicial system
that an innocent person must not be convicted.

 

                   Evidence of a third
party's character or violent disposition is admissible even if it refers to only
one event; see, e.g., Yaeck, supra, at p. 564; and R. v.
Kendall (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 125.

 

                   In the present
appeal, the appellant adduced evidence which could have been relied upon by the
jury in support of his contention that it was Semester who stabbed Heffern.  As
noted above, there was evidence of Semester's criminal record, as well as evidence
connecting him with the stabbing of Day.

 

                   There is little
doubt that the evidence was sufficiently probative to warrant its admission and
use for the appellant's purpose of establishing that Semester had wielded a
knife in the past and therefore was likely to have stabbed Heffern.  If
believed by the jury, that evidence was capable of supporting the appellant's
defence that it was Semester who stabbed Heffern, particularly in light of the
fact that the Heffern stabbing and the Day stabbing occurred within a very
short period of time. 

 

                   After stating that
the accused had a criminal record, the trial judge charged the jury in the
following terms:

 

And
I must warn you that you must not use the prior convictions as evidence that
the accused committed a crime with which he is now charged.  You must not
conclude that because the accused has been convicted of other crimes he is
disposed to commit further crimes.  You can only consider it as I have said, in
deciding the credibility of the accused and you will decide what weight, if
any, should be given to the prior criminal record of the accused on that
matter.

 

That charge was appropriate.  It is
generally not open to the Crown to adduce evidence of the accused's character
in order to suggest that he is likely to have committed the offence with which
he is charged.

 

                   However, the same
rule does not apply to evidence of the character of a third party, such as
Semester.  Unfortunately, the trial judge may have confused the jury on this
point when she stated: 

 

...
as I told you, the fact that a witness has a criminal record is one of the
circumstances that you can consider in deciding on his credibility and how much
weight you wish to give to this evidence but it does not mean that he is not a
trustworthy witness if in your opinion he is credible.

 

                   By referring to the
instructions she earlier gave in respect of the accused, the trial judge may
have misled the jury into supposing that evidence of Semester's character could
not be used as proof of his disposition.  A proper charge in this case would
not cause this confusion.  If, and to the extent that, they accepted the
evidence of Semester's character, the jury was entitled to consider such
evidence in support of the defence theory that there was a reasonable doubt
Semester rather than the appellant stabbed Heffern.  On the facts of this case,
the jury might not have known that the evidence could be relied upon for that
purpose.

 

                   It is expected that
counsel will assist the trial judge in ensuring the charge to the jury is
complete.  It is regrettable that the appellant's trial counsel did not raise
this issue before the trial judge.  However, the defence theory arose naturally
and clearly out of the evidence and the accused was entitled to have the jury
charged with respect to it, R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, at p. 19, per
Spence J.:

 

                          It
is, of course, the duty of a trial judge to submit to the jury in his charge
any defence available to the accused which had been revealed by the evidence
whether or not counsel for the accused chose to advance that defence in his
address to the jury. . . .

 

See also MacAskill v. The King,
[1931] S.C.R. 330, at p. 335. 

 

                   Trial counsel's
failure to object to a jury charge is not determinative of the applicability of
the Criminal Code 's ""curative provision"", s. 686(1) (b)(iii);
see R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at pp. 1319-20.

 

B.The
Issue of Flight

 

                   It is well
established that an inference of guilt may be drawn from circumstantial
evidence such as flight from the scene of a crime or the fabrication of lies
relating to the offence in question.  However, in charging a jury, a trial
judge must take care to ensure that evidence of flight is not misused.  The
danger exists that a jury may erroneously leap from such evidence to a
conclusion of guilt if not properly instructed, see McCormick on Evidence,
supra, vol. 2, § 263, at p. 182:

 

...
in many situations, the inference of consciousness of guilt of the particular
crime is so uncertain and ambiguous and the evidence so prejudicial that one is
forced to wonder whether the evidence is not directed to punishing the
""wicked"" generally rather than resolving the issue of guilt of the
offense charged.

 

                   In Gudmondson v.
The King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.), the appellant was accused of
manslaughter.  This Court held, at pp. 332-33, that the trial judge did not
properly charge the jury with respect to the fact that the appellant did not
stop to give aid to the individuals who had been injured:

 

Then,
the learned Judge's comments upon the conduct of the accused, in proceeding on
his way, without pausing to inquire about the unfortunate victims, were
calculated to convey an erroneous notion as to the significance of that conduct
for the purpose in hand, as well as in respect of its evidentiary cogency.

 

                   Having
said what he did upon this matter, he ought at least to have added a warning to
the jury that such conduct, however reprehensible, could have no more than an
indirect bearing upon the issue before them.... [H]e should have told them that
they ought to be very cautious in imputing to the accused a consciousness of
guilt, because of actions which, on reflection, they might think capable of
explanation as due to panic.

 

                   We
are forced to the conclusion that, on the whole, the charge was likely to
create impressions which might preclude or gravely militate against a judicial
examination by the jury of the grounds of defence.

 

                   In this case, the
jury was clearly told that people sometimes flee in panic from the scene of a
crime, even if they are entirely innocent.  However, in some circumstances, the
direction provided in Gudmondson will be inadequate, and the jury ought
to be given further instruction.  That is true in the present case.  The
appellant admitted to committing one offence, common assault, but denied having
committed another, aggravated assault.  The issue is whether the evidence of
flight could support an inference of guilt with respect to the latter rather
than the former.

 

                   A similar situation
arose in United States v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977).  The
accused was wanted for two robberies; one was committed in Pennsylvania and the
other in Florida.  The reported decision concerns the latter.  There was
evidence that the accused fled when approached by FBI agents.  Clark J.
canvassed the law, adopted the view expressed in McCormick on Evidence
(2nd ed. 1972), § 271, at p. 655, and concluded that the proper approach
determines whether there is sufficient evidence in support of drawing four
inferences:

 

(1)                      from
the accused's behavior to flight,

 

(2)                      from
flight to consciousness of guilt, 

 

(3)                      from
consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the offence in
question,

 

(4)                      from
consciousness of guilt of the offence in question to actual guilt of the
offence in question.

 

Clark J. held that the third inference
could not be drawn.  Since the accused knew that he was wanted for a robbery
committed in Pennsylvania, the possibility existed that he fled solely out of
consciousness of guilt with respect to it, rather than the Florida robbery.  To
be useful, flight must give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt in
regard to a specific offence.

 

                   The test
articulated in Myers provides helpful guidance on the inferences that
may be drawn from evidence of an accused's flight (or other possible indicia of
consciousness of guilt, such as lying).  Such evidence can serve the function
of indicating consciousness of guilt only if it relates to a particular
offence.  Consequently, where an accused's conduct may be equally explained by
reference to consciousness of guilt of two or more offences, and where an
accused has admitted culpability in respect of one or more of these offences, a
trial judge should instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value
with respect to any particular offence.

 

                   Those principles
can be applied to the facts of this appeal.  The trial judge simply told the
jury that people often flee the scene of a crime even if they are entirely
innocent.  Having said what she did upon this matter, she also should have told
the jury that because the appellant's flight was equally consistent with both
common assault and aggravated assault, it could not be evidence of guilt of the
latter.  Any inference to be drawn from flight disappears when an explanation
for such flight is available, as it is here. 

 

                   The jury should
have been warned against drawing any inference from the fact of flight.  The
trial judge's direction that even innocent people sometimes flee the scene of a
crime was insufficient in light of the fact that the appellant admitted that he
had committed common assault by punching Heffern, and thus had reason to flee. 
The issue was not whether the appellant fled because he was guilty or because
he panicked despite being innocent.  Rather, the issue was whether the
appellant's flight indicated a consciousness of guilt arising from the fact
that he had stabbed Heffern or rather from the fact that he had punched
Heffern.  And on that question, the evidence could have no probative value.

 

C.The
Applicability of Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code

 

                   The principles and
tests to be applied under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code ,
the ""curative provision"", are a matter of settled jurisprudence. 
That section places a burden on the Crown to justify the denial of a new trial
despite the presence of an error in the lower court.  While the satisfaction of
that onus is a condition precedent to the application of the curative
provision, the curative provision need not be applied even if the onus is met. 
In  Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 744, the
applicable test was stated to be whether ""the verdict would necessarily
have been the same if such error had not occurred"".  See also Wildman
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 328-29; R. v. S.
(P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 919;  R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3
S.C.R. 595, at p. 620; R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697, at pp.
736-37; and R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617.

 

                   Having regard to
the cumulative effect of the errors, I am of the view that the curative
provision is inapplicable in the present case.  There is a possibility that,
but for the trial judge's errors, the jury's verdict would have been different.

 

                   The jury was not
properly charged with respect to the use that could be made of the evidence
adduced by the appellant concerning the fact that Semester had a propensity for
violence as evidenced by his previous conviction for armed robbery and the
evidence that connected him to the stabbing of Day which occurred within the
half hour before the stabbing of Heffern.  It was not enough for the trial
judge to instruct the jury that they could consider Semester's criminal record
in assessing his credibility as a witness.  She should have also instructed the
jury that they could consider such evidence in connection with the appellant's
contention that it was Semester who stabbed Heffern.  If properly instructed,
it is possible that the jury would have had a reasonable doubt as to the
appellant's guilt. 

 

                   The trial judge
also failed to properly instruct the jury regarding the use that could be made
of the evidence of the appellant's flight from the scene.  It was not
sufficient to tell the jury that entirely innocent men sometimes flee the scene
of a crime.  By his own admission, the appellant was not entirely innocent; he
admitted that he had punched Heffern.  The trial judge should have instructed
the jury that the appellant's flight was equally consistent with common assault
and with aggravated assault, and therefore was incapable of supporting an
inference of consciousness of guilt with respect to the latter.  Because she
did not charge the jury in those terms, there is a danger that the jury may
have wrongly inferred from the evidence that the appellant fled because of his
guilt in stabbing Heffern.  Since the jury might have reached a different
verdict if properly charged, the curative provision cannot apply.

Charge to jury ‑‑ Question from jury ‑‑ Whether trial
judge erred in his answer in differentiating between previous threats and
threats made against accused on evening of incident and in relating previous
threats only to existence of assault ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 34(2) , 265(1) .

 

                   The accused was
charged with the second degree murder of R.   R was involved in drug
trafficking with E, with whom the accused's daughter was living.  At trial, the
accused described the terrible existence caused by the presence of E in her
house and by his drug trafficking.  She said that he was always angry and
threatened her frequently.  The accused moved in order to put an end to E's
presence in her house, but this was unsuccessful, as he continued to go to her
home to conduct his illegal activities.  According to the accused, on the
evening of the crime, E went to her home with a revolver and cocaine and asked
her to hide the weapon.  He forced her to weigh some cocaine and suggested he
would kill her, together with her daughter and granddaughter.  Shortly
afterwards the accused's daughter arrived accompanied by R.  At this point the
accused consumed a small amount of drugs and she then went to get the weapon
she had hidden in the bathroom.  She fired at E and seeing that R was lunging
at her, she also fired at him.  E survived but R died.  In his charge to the
jury, the trial judge explained the law of self‑defence and summarized
the main points in the evidence which could support this defence.  In reply to
a question from the jury, the judge indicated that the act or threat giving
rise to self‑defence must have taken place on the evening of the crime,
and that the previous threats or acts are only relevant in assessing the
assault on the evening of the crime.  The accused was convicted of second
degree murder.  The Court of Appeal allowed the accused's appeal and ordered a
new trial.  In a majority judgment the court held that the trial judge erred in
his answer to the jury's question in differentiating the previous threats from
the threats made on the evening of the incident and in relating the previous
threats only to the existence of an assault.

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and Major JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

 

(1)  Self‑defence: 
Applicable Principles

 

                   It can be seen from
s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code  that there are three constituent
elements of self‑defence when, as here, the victim has died: 
(1) the existence of an unlawful assault; (2) a reasonable
apprehension of a risk of death or grievous bodily harm; and (3) a
reasonable belief that it is not possible to preserve oneself from harm except
by killing the attacker.  In all three cases the jury must seek to determine
how the accused perceived the relevant facts and whether that perception was
reasonable.  This is an objective determination.  An honest but reasonable
mistake as to the existence of an assault is therefore permitted.  The
existence of an assault must not be made a kind of prerequisite for the
exercise of self‑defence to be assessed without regard to the perception
of the accused.  It is the accused's state of mind that is relevant and must be
examined.  The question that the jury must ask itself is not whether ""the
accused was  unlawfully assaulted"" but rather whether ""the accused reasonably
believed, in the circumstances, that she was being unlawfully assaulted"". 
Nor is there a formal requirement that the danger be imminent.  Imminence is
only one of the factors which the jury should weigh in determining whether the
accused had a reasonable apprehension of danger and a reasonable belief that
she could not extricate herself otherwise than by killing the attacker.

 

(2)  Self‑defence: 
Charge to Jury

 

                   Per
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  The trial
judge erred in limiting his answer to the jury's question to only one of the
elements of self‑defence, namely the existence of an assault.  First,
this answer suggests that the only relevance of the threats prior to the
evening of the crime was in enabling the jury to determine whether there had
actually been an assault (in this case, death threats) that evening and whether
the assailant was in a position to carry out those threats.  This diverted the
jury from the question it really should have been considering, namely the
reasonable belief of the accused in the existence of an assault.  Emphasizing
the victims' acts rather than the accused's state of mind has the effect of
depriving the latter of the benefit of any error, however reasonable. 
Secondly, although it is true that the previous threats may help the jury to
decide whether threats were made on the evening of the crime, they are also
very relevant in determining what the accused believed, not only concerning the
existence of the threats, but also concerning her apprehension of a risk of
death or grievous bodily harm and her belief in the need to use deadly force. 
By failing to mention these two elements in his answer, the trial judge
seriously limited the relevance of the previous threats and might have led the
jury to disregard the entire atmosphere of terror which the accused said
pervaded her house.  Those threats form an integral part of the circumstances
on which the perception of the accused might have been based.  It is clear that
the way in which a reasonable person would have acted cannot be assessed
without taking into account these crucial circumstances.  In explaining how the
threats prior to the evening of the crime could be used the trial judge should
actually have referred not only to s. 265(1)(b) of the Code
but also, most importantly, to s. 34(2) .

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and Major JJ. (dissenting):  The judge's answer contained no
error.  It did not overlook the very important element of the accused's
belief.  While he did not elaborate on this point in his answer, he emphasized
each of the elements of self‑defence by three times re‑reading
s. 265(1)(b) of the Code.  The trial judge had already read
this paragraph in his general charge and gone on to give clear and complete
explanations of the essential criterion of the accused's state of mind at the
time she caused the death, including her apprehension of death or grievous
bodily harm from which she could not preserve herself except by the force she
used.  The purpose referred to in the judge's answer could only be the purpose
to kill on the part of the victim, and his comment on the belief on reasonable
grounds that the victim had present ability to effect this purpose could mean
nothing other than the accused's belief that the victim was capable of killing
the accused, leaving her no alternative but to act first.  Consequently, one
cannot conclude that the judge's answer could have been understood by the jury
or could have led it to make a finding other than on the basis of a reasonable
belief by the accused in a danger of death which she could not avoid except by
killing her attacker.

C.J. ‑‑ 

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The respondent
Colette Pétel is charged with the second degree murder of Alain Raymond.  She
is the mother of Josée Desjardins, who, at the time of the alleged offence, was
Serge Edsell's girlfriend.  Edsell and Raymond were jointly involved in drug
trafficking.

 

                   Josée Desjardins
and Serge Edsell met and began living together in March 1989.  In early May,
after being evicted from the apartment where they were living, they moved in
temporarily with the respondent.  In her testimony the respondent described the
terrible existence caused by Edsell's presence in her house, the fact that he
was engaged in drug trafficking there and the comings and goings of his
customers in the house.  She said that Edsell was always angry, that he
threatened her frequently and that he beat his girlfriend Josée Desjardins. 
The respondent even tried to commit suicide.  However, this version of the
facts was contradicted by the testimony of Josée Desjardins at the preliminary
inquiry.  (Desjardins was killed before the trial and so could not testify at
it.)  She denied that she had ever been beaten by Edsell.

 

                   In early July the
respondent moved in order to put an end to Edsell's presence in her house. 
This was unsuccessful, as Edsell continued to go to the respondent's home to conduct
his drug trafficking operations.

 

                   On July 21,
Edsell went to the respondent's home with a revolver, cocaine and scales.  He
asked her to hide the weapon.  He forced her to weigh some cocaine and then
suggested he would kill her, together with her daughter and granddaughter. 
Shortly afterwards Josée Desjardins arrived accompanied by Alain Raymond.  At
this point the respondent consumed a small amount of drugs and then went to get
the weapon she had hidden in the bathroom.  She fired at Edsell, who fell at
once.  Seeing that Raymond was lunging at her, she also fired at him.  Edsell
survived but Raymond died of his injuries.  Josée Desjardins' version of the
facts was slightly different.  She said that the respondent fired on Edsell and
then aimed at her own daughter.  Raymond then tried to escape and that is when
the respondent also shot him.

 

                   In her statements
to the police immediately after these events the respondent admitted firing at
Edsell and Raymond and said she wished both of them dead.

III.  Decisions of
Quebec Courts

 

Superior Court

 

                   It is necessary to
analyze in detail the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury
regarding self‑defence, since the respondent challenged their validity.

 

                   The trial judge
began this part of his charge by reading s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code 
to the jury.  He then identified four elements of this defence.  First, there
was the existence of an assault, here defined by s. 265(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code , which he read to the jury.  Second, the accused must
have intended to cause the victim's death.  The third and fourth conditions are
found in s. 34(2) (a) and (b), namely reasonable apprehension
of death or grievous bodily harm and a reasonable belief that it is not
possible to preserve oneself from that danger except by killing the assailant.

 

                   The trial judge
went on to say that the jury must base its decision on [translation] ""the accused's assessment of the
situation"".  That means, the judge said, that the accused can be in a self‑defence
situation even if her perception of the events was wrong, provided this error
of perception could have been made by an ordinary person placed in the same
circumstances.  The judge also said that the accused did not have to wait to be
hit first in order to rely on self‑defence.

 

                   The judge then
summarized the main pieces of evidence pertaining to the situation of self‑defence
in which the respondent claimed she had been.  In particular, he discussed the
probative value to be given to Josée Desjardins' testimony.  Finally, he noted
the evidence presented of Edsell's and Raymond's propensity for violence, in
particular by means of their criminal records.

 

                   The jury began its
deliberations and, after asking to hear the respondent's testimony again, it
submitted a question to the judge.  This question read as follows:

 

[translation]

 

Definition
of self‑defence

 

(1)
Threats or acts which may have taken place over several months

 

(2)
Threats which were made on the evening of July 21, 1989 only

 

The judge answered this question as
follows:

 

[translation]  So, in other words,
ladies and gentlemen, you are asking me to define for you, if I understand
correctly, the meaning of the word ""assault"" in the context of the
justification of self‑defence.  First, what is an assault, and I will re‑read
to you s. 265(1) (b) of the Criminal Code , which applies in the present
case, so:

 

""A
person commits an assault when he attempts or threatens, by an act or a
gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other
person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect
his purpose.""

 

                                                                   . . .

 

                   So
the act or threat mentioned in s. 265(1) (b) must have taken place on the
evening of July 21 because the Code clearly says ""has present
ability"", that is, at the actual time of the events.  Now, threats or acts
prior to July 21 are relevant in that they may help you to assess the
assault on the evening of July 21, 1989.

 

                   In
other words, these previous acts or threats help you to determine whether Alain
Raymond and Serge Edsell attempted or threatened, because according to the
evidence, if you believe it, this was a common plan, whether as I say Alain
Raymond or Serge Edsell attempted or threatened on the evening of July 21,
by an act or a gesture, to apply force to Mrs. Pétel, to her daughter or
to her granddaughter, whether the assailant had or caused . . . the alleged
victim to believe on reasonable grounds that he had present ability to effect
his purpose.

 

                   So
the previous facts help you to assess the situation, but the threat or the
assault or the threat or the gesture that evening, in the context of a, of the
carrying out of an assault, that must be assessed on July 21.

 

                   The jury convicted
the accused of second degree murder.

 

Court of Appeal (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 543

 

                   The respondent
appealed her conviction to the Court of Appeal.  She argued that the charge to
the jury on self‑defence was erroneous.  She submitted that the judge
should have said that the previous threats were relevant in determining not
only whether the victims threatened the accused and had present ability to
effect their purpose, but also, which he failed to do, in determining the
accused's state of mind regarding the imminence of the assault and the belief
that she could not otherwise preserve herself from death.  The respondent based
her arguments on R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852.

 

Proulx J.A.

 

                   Proulx J.A.
found that the trial judge had made two errors.  First, he had failed to tell
the jury that the fact Alain Raymond lunged at the respondent, probably in
order to take the weapon from her, was an independent ground which could be a
basis for self‑defence.  The jury could thus have thought that the death
threats made by Edsell were the only ground that could justify her killing the
two men.

 

                   Second,
Proulx J.A. was of the view that the answer given by the trial judge to
the jury's question regarding threats was inadequate.  In his opinion, Lavallee
indicates that a contextual approach should be taken in assessing the
apprehension of danger and the belief in the need to use deadly force. 
Accordingly the history, circumstances and perceptions of the accused must be
taken into account and it is not absolutely necessary to call an expert witness
on this point.  The threats prior to the events of July 21 were highly
relevant in determining whether the accused had a reasonable apprehension of an
imminent assault causing death or grievous bodily harm.  However, the answer to
the jury's question could suggest that the only relevance of the previous
threats and acts was to determine whether or not the victims had made threats
on the evening of July 21.  According to Proulx J.A., this was an
error of law justifying an order for a new trial, since it is not clear that
the jury would have come to the same conclusion if it had been given a complete
answer.

 

LeBel J.A.

 

                   LeBel J.A.
agreed with Proulx J.A. on the question of the distinction between the
threats immediately preceding the incident and the previous threats.  However,
he considered that the trial judge had made no error in failing to mention
Raymond's gesture as an independent basis for self‑defence.

 

McCarthy J.A. (dissenting)

 

                   McCarthy J.A.
was of the view that Lavallee dealt with a different kind of situation
from that of the respondent, and he considered that in any event that case
recognized the validity of the presumption that a person is not in a self‑defence
situation if the danger is not imminent.  Only expert testimony, said
McCarthy J.A., can rebut this presumption.  He therefore considered that
the trial judge was right in telling the jury that the assault had to be
imminent on the evening of July 21.

 

IV.  Issue

 

                   As this is an
appeal as of right, the only issue before this Court is the one on which there
was a dissent, namely whether the trial judge erred in his answer to the jury's
question in differentiating the threats made on the evening of the incident
from the previous threats and in relating the latter only to whether there had
been an assault.

 

V.  Analysis

 

A.  Elements of Self‑defence

 

                   The law on self‑defence
has often been criticized for its complexity and lack of coherence: 
D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law:  A Treatise (2nd ed. 1987),
at p. 413; and Canada Law Reform Commission, Working Paper 29, Criminal
Law ‑‑ The General Part:  Liability and Defences (1982), at
p. 116.  When the courts interpret the provisions of the Criminal Code ,
they should therefore try to confine themselves to general principles and not
unnecessarily create complex rules and subtle distinctions.

 

                   It can be seen from
the wording of s. 34(2) of the Code that there are three
constituent elements of self‑defence, when as here the victim has died: 
(1) the existence of an unlawful assault; (2) a reasonable
apprehension of a risk of death or grievous bodily harm; and (3) a
reasonable belief that it is not possible to preserve oneself from harm except
by killing the adversary.

 

                   In all three cases
the jury must seek to determine how the accused perceived the relevant facts
and whether that perception was reasonable.  Accordingly, this is an objective
determination.  With respect to the last two elements, this approach results
from the language used in the Code and was confirmed by this Court in Reilly
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 396, at p. 404:

 

The
subsection can only afford protection to the accused if he apprehended death or
grievous bodily harm from the assault he was repelling and if he believed he
could not preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm otherwise than by
the force he used.  Nonetheless, his apprehension must be a reasonable
one and his belief must be based upon reasonable and probable grounds. 
The subsection requires that the jury consider, and be guided by, what they
decide on the evidence was the accused's appreciation of the situation and his
belief as to the reaction it required, so long as there exists an objectively
verifiable basis for his perception.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   Some doubt may
still exist as to whether this passage from Reilly also applies to the
existence of an assault.  For my part, I think that the word
""situation"" refers to the three elements of s. 34(2) .  An honest
but reasonable mistake as to the existence of an assault is therefore
permitted.  This is also how the Ontario Court of Appeal understood it in R.
v. Nelson (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at p. 455.  The existence of an
assault must not be made a kind of prerequisite for the exercise of self‑defence
to be assessed without regard to the perception of the accused.  This would
amount in a sense to trying the victim before the accused.  In a case involving
self‑defence, it is the accused's state of mind that must be examined,
and it is the accused (and not the victim) who must be given the benefit of a
reasonable doubt.  The question that the jury must ask itself is therefore not
""was the accused unlawfully assaulted?"" but rather ""did the
accused reasonably believe, in the circumstances, that she was being unlawfully
assaulted?"".

 

                   Moreover, Lavallee,
supra, rejected the rule requiring that the apprehended danger be
imminent.  This alleged rule, which does not appear anywhere in the text of the
Criminal Code , is in fact only a mere assumption based on common sense. 
As Wilson J. noted in Lavallee, this assumption undoubtedly derives
from the paradigmatic case of self‑defence, which is an altercation
between two persons of equal strength.  However, evidence may be presented (in
particular expert evidence) to rebut this presumption of fact.  There is thus
no formal requirement that the danger be imminent.  Imminence is only one of
the factors which the jury should weigh in determining whether the accused had
a reasonable apprehension of danger and a reasonable belief that she could not
extricate herself otherwise than by killing the attacker.

 

B.  Charge to the Jury

 

                   In his charge the
trial judge reiterated the three elements indicated by the wording of
s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code , namely the existence of an assault,
the apprehension of a danger of death or grievous bodily harm and the
impossibility of otherwise extricating oneself.  He added that the accused must
have intended to cause her attacker's death.  Although it is not strictly
speaking an element of self‑defence, this fourth criterion was justified
in the circumstances since this was a murder charge.  In any event, the
respondent does not deny that she intended to cause the death of Edsell and
Raymond.

 

                   The judge also said
that the jury should try to determine how the accused assessed the situation
and compare that assessment with what a reasonable person placed in the same
circumstances would have thought.  To explain this, the judge repeated almost
word for word two paragraphs from Reilly.

 

                   The judge then went
on to summarize the main points in the evidence which could support the
respondent's defence.  He did not limit the relevance of a particular piece of
evidence to its effect on only one of the elements of self‑defence. 
Accordingly, one may conclude that the jury must have understood that they were
to look at the evidence as a whole in considering each element of self‑defence. 
This is exactly what s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code  requires.  Thus
no fault may be found in the main charge given by the trial judge, a judge of
great experience; on the contrary, it could serve as a model.

 

                   The same is not
true, however, of the answer given by the judge to the question put to him by
the jury regarding the relevance of the threats immediately preceding the
incident of July 21 and the threats prior to that date.  The importance of
adequately answering questions put by the jury should be borne in mind:  R.
v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 759‑60.  The question
will generally relate to an important point in the jury's reasoning, so that
any error the judge may make in answering it becomes all the more damaging.  It
is often necessary to repeat certain aspects of the main charge in order to place
the specific question in a more general context.

 

                   The question asked
by the jury was specific, as the jury had identified its concern:  the threats
made by the victim in the months preceding the incident and those made on the
day itself and, it can be assumed, the distinction that should be made between
the two types of threat or act.  The question was general, however, in the
sense that the jury did not indicate whether its concern related only to one
element of self‑defence.  The question concerned the ""definition of
self‑defence"", without more detail.  The judge nonetheless limited
his answer to only one of the elements, the existence of an assault and the
assailant's ability to carry it out.  This led him to make two errors.

 

                   First, the judge's
answer suggested that the only relevance of the threats prior to July 21
was in enabling the jury to determine whether there had actually been an
assault on the evening of July 21, that is, in the present case, death
threats, and whether the assailant was in a position to carry out those
threats.  In a way the judge treated the earlier threats like similar fact
evidence of the present threats.  Their only use would then be to make it more
plausible that Edsell also made threats in the minutes preceding the shots
fired by the accused.  This in my view diverted the jury from the question it
really should have been considering, namely the reasonable belief of the
accused in the existence of an assault.  Emphasizing the victims' acts rather
than the accused's state of mind has the effect of depriving the latter of the
benefit of any error, however reasonable.  The jury's attention should not be
diverted from its proper concern,  the guilt of the accused, by an inquiry into
the guilt of the victim.

 

                   Secondly, and this
is the crucial point, the judge's answer might have led the jury to believe
that the threats made before July 21 could serve no other purpose than to
determine the existence of the assault and the assailant's ability, thus
denying their relevance to reasonable apprehension of a danger of death or
grievous bodily harm and to the belief that there was no solution but to kill
the attacker.  The judge said that the previous threats served to [translation] ""assess the assault
on the evening of July 21"".  He then explained what ""assess the
assault"" meant:

 

[translation]  . . .
these previous acts or threats help you to determine whether Alain
Raymond and Serge Edsell attempted or threatened . . . to apply force
to Mrs. Pétel . . . whether the assailant had or caused .
. . the alleged victim to believe on reasonable grounds that he had present
ability to effect his purpose.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The judge was in fact here repeating
almost exactly the wording of s. 265(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . 
Although it is true that the previous threats can help the jury to decide whether
threats were made immediately before the respondent shot Edsell and Raymond,
they are also very relevant in determining what the respondent believed, not
only concerning the existence of the threats, but also concerning her
apprehension of the risk of death and her belief in the need to use deadly
force.  By failing to mention these two elements in his answer, the trial judge
seriously limited the relevance of the earlier threats.  In explaining how
these threats could be used he should actually have referred not only to
s. 265(1) (b) but also, most importantly, to s. 34(2) of the Code.

 

                   The importance of
failing to relate the earlier threats to the elements of self‑defence
cannot be underestimated.  The threats made by Edsell throughout his
cohabitation with the respondent are very relevant in determining whether the
respondent had a reasonable apprehension of danger and a reasonable belief in
the need to kill Edsell and Raymond.  The threats prior to July 21 form an
integral part of the circumstances on which the perception of the accused might
have been based.  The judge's answer to this question might thus have led the
jury to disregard the entire atmosphere of terror which the respondent said
pervaded her house.  It is clear that the way in which a reasonable person
would have acted cannot be assessed without taking into account these crucial
circumstances.  As Wilson J. noted in Lavallee, at p. 883:

 

                   The
issue is not, however, what an outsider would have reasonably perceived but
what the accused reasonably perceived, given her situation and her experience.

 

By unduly limiting the relevance of
the previous threats the judge in a sense invited the jury to determine what an
outsider would have done in the same situation as the respondent.

 

VI.  Conclusion

 

                   The undisputed
evidence that Edsell, her alleged attacker, handed over his weapon and asked
his future victim to hide it, conduct that is odd to say the least for someone
intending to kill, must have had a clear effect on the jury, indeed on any jury
composed of reasonable individuals.  In the Court of Appeal and in this Court,
however, counsel for the Crown did not argue that, given the evidence in this
case, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred, and that
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should thus be
applied.  The Crown has the burden of showing that this provision is
applicable:  Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739.  This Court
cannot apply it proprio motu.  Having found an error of law in the
judge's answer to the question by the jury, I must accordingly dismiss the
appeal and affirm the order for a new trial.

 

                   English version of
the reasons of La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Major JJ. delivered by

 

                   Gonthier J. (dissenting) ‑‑ I have
had the benefit of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice.  I agree with his
statement of the applicable principles of law and his explanation of those
principles.  However, I cannot concur in his reading of the answer given by the
trial judge to the question asked by the jury regarding previous threats or
acts and the threats of the evening of July 21, 1989 as they affect the
definition of self‑defence.  In my view the judge's answer did not
overlook the very important element of the accused's belief.  In his answer to
the jury the judge clearly said:

 

                   [translation]  In other words,
these previous acts or threats help you to determine whether Alain Raymond and
Serge Edsell attempted or threatened . . . on the evening of July 21,
by an act or a gesture, to apply force to Mrs. Pétel, to her daughter or
to her granddaughter, whether the assailant had or caused . . . the
alleged victim to believe on reasonable grounds that he had present ability to
effect his purpose.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   It is true that the
judge did not elaborate on the accused's belief, nor did he elaborate on the
elements of the definition of self‑defence other than the relative
importance of the previous threats and the threats at the time of the crime,
which was all that the question asked by the jury dealt with.

 

                   However, he
emphasized and pointed to each of the elements of this defence by three times
re‑reading s. 265(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C‑46 .  He could not have done this any better or any more
succinctly and clearly.  This re‑reading, which he characterized as such,
repeated his reading of the paragraph in his general charge the day before,
which was immediately followed by clear and complete explanations of the
essential criterion of the accused's state of mind at the time she caused the
death, including her apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from which
she could not preserve herself except by the force she used.

 

                   There could be no
doubt as to the ""purpose"" in question.  Only one thing was discussed,
the purpose to kill on the part of the victim.  The belief on reasonable
grounds that the victim had present ability to effect this purpose could mean
nothing other than the accused's belief that the victim was capable of killing
the accused, thus leaving her no alternative but to act first.  With all due
respect, I cannot conclude that the judge's answer could have been understood
by the jury or could have led it to make a finding other than on the basis of a
reasonable belief by the accused in a danger of death which she could not avoid
except by killing her attacker.  In my opinion, the judge's answer contained no
error and was adequate.

 

                   I would therefore
allow the appeal.  I would set aside the Court of Appeal's judgment and restore
the guilty verdict.

on appeal from the court of appeal for
alberta

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Charge to jury ‑‑ Recharge ‑‑ Trial judge responding to
question from jury regarding reasonable doubt ‑‑ Whether trial
judge erred in recharge ‑‑ If so, whether error constitutes grounds
for retrial if main charge free from error ‑‑ Whether verdict
convicting accused unreasonable.

 

                   The accused was
charged with sexually assaulting his twin nieces, who were 12 or 13 at the time
of the alleged events, although the charges were not laid until several years
later.  He was convicted on one count and acquitted on the other.  The only
evidence presented at the trial pertaining to the assault of which he was
convicted was that of the complainant and the accused.  The complainant
described the alleged incident and stated she avoided her uncle thereafter, but
confirmed that she subsequently went to work at a remote resort where she knew
her uncle was employed.  The accused denied that the incident had ever
occurred.  In the main charge the trial judge properly instructed the jury on
all matters including directions as to the onus resting upon the Crown to prove
the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  At the conclusion of
the charge, the jury retired to deliberate.  Four hours later, they submitted a
question to the trial judge stating that ""[t]he jury is hung up"" and
requesting ""an explanation of the guideline on the jury's duty regarding
evidence and reasonable doubt"".  In the trial judge's response, he made
certain statements that might suggest the jury had to choose between two
competing versions, that of the complainants on the one hand and that of the
accused on the other.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the accused's appeal from
his conviction.  It was unanimous in its finding that the recharge on the issue
of reasonable doubt did not constitute a reversible error.  The majority
further determined that the verdict was not unreasonable.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé and
McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ.:  While directions to a jury must always be
read as a whole, questions from the jury require careful consideration and must
be clearly, correctly and comprehensively answered.  A question presented by a
jury gives the clearest possible indication of the particular problem that the
jury is confronting and upon which it seeks further instructions.  Even if the
question relates to a matter that has been carefully reviewed in the main
charge, it may be that after a period of deliberation, the original
instructions have been forgotten or some confusion has arisen in the minds of
the jurors.  If an error is made in the recharge, then as a general rule the
correctness of the original charge cannot be used to excuse the subsequent
error on the very issue upon which the jury seeks clarification.  The greater
the passage of time between the main charge and the question from the jury, the
more imperative it is that a correct and comprehensive answer be given.  Here,
four hours had elapsed between the main charge and the question submitted, and it
was therefore essential the response be correct and comprehensive.

 

                   Running through the
recharge in this case is the notion of choosing between the credibility of the
complainant and that of the accused.  The approach set out would have conveyed
to the jury that they had to believe either the complainant's evidence or that
of the accused.  This type of either/or approach to credibility is incorrect as
it excludes the third alternative, namely that without believing the accused,
the jury may still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt on the whole of the
evidence.  It shifts the burden of proof to the accused by telling the jury it
can only acquit if the accused's story is believed rather than that of the
complainant.  While the trial judge told the jury several times in the recharge
that they had to base their verdict on ""the whole of the evidence""
and ""the whole of the case"", the only evidence in this case was the
evidence of the complainant and the accused, and those words would thus
indicate that the jury had the choice of believing either the complainant's or
the accused's evidence.  This error in the recharge constitutes a ground for
directing a new trial.

 

                   In view of this
conclusion it is not necessary to consider the question of whether the verdict
was unreasonable.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and
McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  While questions from the jury merit a full,
careful and correct response, it is a settled principle that the main charge
and the recharge must be read as a whole in determining whether the trial judge
misdirected the jury.  The task of the Court of Appeal is to determine whether
the jury might have been misled by the alleged error, taking into account all
relevant circumstances.  In this case any error in the recharge could not be saved
by the fact that the judge had correctly charged the jury in the first
instance, since the recharge was in answer to a question, which may heighten
its significance, and it came some hours after the main charge.  The trial
judge did not err, however, in recharging the jury.  He told the jury several
times during the recharge that it could only conclude that the Crown had proved
its case beyond a reasonable doubt after weighing all of the evidence.  In
other words, the jury could not resolve the case simply by deciding whether it
believed the complainant or the accused.  Since the only witnesses were the
complainant and the accused, the trial judge did not err in indicating that
total rejection of all the accused's evidence, coupled with acceptance of the complainant's
evidence, would leave no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could be
based.  As well, the trial judge expressly told the jury that their task was
not concluded if they rejected the accused's evidence, as they had to go on to
ask themselves the further question of whether they entertained a reasonable
doubt.  Provided that the jury was clearly advised that the case was not a
simple credibility contest and that after having considered all the evidence it
must consider whether it was left with any reasonable doubt, mention of the
competing versions before the jury was not in error.

 

                   As there was ample
evidence before the jury upon which it could convict, the verdict in this case
was not unreasonable.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- The principal
questions raised on this appeal are these:  Did the trial judge err in
responding to a question from the jury pertaining to reasonable doubt?  If so,
can it constitute the grounds for a retrial if the main charge was free from
error on this issue?

 

Factual Background

 

                   The appellant was
charged with two counts of sexual assault against his twin nieces S.D. and
V.D.  He was acquitted on the count involving V.D. and the Crown took no appeal
from that acquittal.  He was convicted  on the count involving S.D.  He
appealed his conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal on two grounds:  first,
that the trial judge had erred in his recharge to the jury on the issue of
reasonable doubt, and secondly, on the basis that the verdict was unreasonable. 
The appeal was dismissed.  McClung J. dissented from that decision, holding
that the verdict was unreasonable.  The appellant was granted leave to appeal
to this Court on the issue of the recharge on reasonable doubt: [1993] 3 S.C.R.
ix.

 

                   At the time of the
trial, which took place in October of 1991, the appellant was 74 years of age. 
The assault was said to have occurred in the fall of 1986, when the complainant
was in grade 7, and was 12 or 13 years of age.  At the time, the appellant
lived in a house trailer on the farm belonging to the complainants' family. 
The house where the complainants lived with their parents, two other sisters
and a brother was only some 50 metres from the trailer. 

 

                   S.D. testified that
the appellant called her on the telephone and asked her to come over to his
trailer to look at some books.  She went to the trailer, and looked at the
books for a few minutes.  She said that the appellant kept moving closer to
her.  He then stood up and undid his pants.  He pushed the complainant over
onto her back, and pulled her pants down.  He started ""playing"" with
her breasts, and then attempted to enter her with his penis.  The complainant
tried to push him away and told him to get off.  The telephone then rang and
the appellant got up to answer it and pulled up his pants.  At this point, the
complainant left the trailer.  S.D. stated she avoided her uncle after the
incident.  However, she confirmed that subsequent to the alleged assault she
went to work at a remote resort where she knew her uncle was employed.

 

                   The appellant
testified and denied that the incident had ever occurred.  There is no
suggestion that threats were ever made by the appellant to his nieces.  The
complaint of S.D. was not made until several years after the incident.  After
her complaint was made, the police contacted her sister V.D., who also then
made a complaint.  There was no corroboration for either allegation aside from
evidence which was never in dispute that on some occasions the complainants
were alone with their uncle.

 

                   The only evidence
presented at the trial pertaining to the incident was that of the complainant
and the appellant.  There was no other evidence for the jury to consider.

 

Proceedings at Trial

 

                   It is conceded that
in the main charge the trial judge properly instructed the jury on all matters
including directions as to the onus resting upon the Crown to prove the case
against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.  At the conclusion of the charge,
the jury retired to deliberate.  Four hours later, the jury submitted a
question to the trial judge.  All questions from the jury are extremely
important; however, the wording of the question presented in this case
emphasizes its fundamental importance for the jury.  It was framed in this way:

 

                   The
jury is hung up and there has been no change in the vote.  We would like an
explanation of the guideline on the jury's duty regarding evidence and
reasonable doubt.

 

                   The response of the
trial judge to that question gives rise to difficulties presented in this
case.  He stated:

 

The
accused is entitled to a reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility; who is
to be believed, either complainant in each of the counts or the accused.  If
you cannot reject his evidence, it must raise a reasonable doubt.  If you
believe his evidence, it raises a reasonable doubt.  If you reject his
evidence, in comparison to the evidence of either of the complainants and that
complainant's evidence is accepted by you as being true, then you convict.

 

                   It's
as simple to say it as that.  I know it is difficult to work out.  You have two
stories here.  You have to decide whether one is strong enough -- one of the
complainants' evidence is strong enough to convince you of the guilt, and you
can reject the accused's evidence.  If it isn't that strong and you can't
reject the accused's evidence, you must have a reasonable doubt.  If it is that
strong, and you can reject the accused's evidence, you should be able to say, I
am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   Now,
I don't know what -- if you want me to deal with evidence any further, any
point of evidence or just what your duties are with respect to the evidence.  I
will tell you what they are.  You weigh all of the evidence, and you look at
the whole case, and you say, looking at everything, Am I convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is correct and his evidence can't be
accepted, and you do that with each count.

 

                   Following these
remarks it appears from the transcript that some members of the jury were
confused because the trial judge added these words:

 

I
see some nodding yes; I see some still wondering, but I know you have a
difficult task, but you must seize it and deal with it as best you can.

 

                   At the conclusion
of these remarks, the jury then retired and continued its deliberations for
another 4½ hours.  They then returned and delivered the verdict acquitting the
accused of the charge of assaulting V.D. but convicting him of the assault upon
S.D.

 

The Court of Appeal

 

                   The Court of Appeal
was unanimous in its finding that the recharge on the issue of reasonable doubt
did not constitute a reversible error.  The majority further determined that
the verdict was not unreasonable.  McClung J.A. in dissent would have allowed
the appeal on the ground that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.

 

                   The appellant
brought an appeal as of right to this Court on the question of unreasonable
verdict.  As well he sought and obtained leave to appeal on the issue of the
recharge on reasonable doubt.

 

Analysis

 

Significance and
Importance of Questions from the Jury

 

                   It is true that
directions to a jury must always be read as a whole;  however, it cannot ever
be forgotten that questions from the jury require careful consideration and
must be clearly, correctly and comprehensively answered.  This is true for any
number of reasons which have been expressed by this Court on other occasions. 
A question presented by a jury gives the clearest possible indication of the
particular problem that the jury is confronting and upon which it seeks further
instructions.  Even if the question relates to a matter that has been carefully
reviewed in the main charge, it still must be answered in a complete and
careful manner.  It may be that after a period of deliberation, the original
instructions, no matter how exemplary they were, have been forgotten or some
confusion has arisen in the minds of the jurors.  The jury must be given a full
and proper response to their question.  The jury is entitled to no less.  It is
the obligation of the trial judge assisted by counsel to make certain that the
question is fully and properly answered.

 

                   The importance of
giving a full and proper response to questions from the jury has been
recognized by this Court on a number of occasions.  In R. v. W. (D.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 759-60, the following was stated on behalf of the
majority:

 

When
a jury submits a question, it gives a clear indication of the problem the jury
is having with a case.  Those questions merit a full, careful and correct
response.  As well, the answer should remind the jury of its instructions given
in the course of the main charge.  See R. v. Desveaux (1986), 26 C.C.C.
(3d) 88 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 93, where it was said:

 

Questions
from a jury manifest their concern and indicate their desire for direction on a
particular issue.  The trial judge should read the question to counsel and
obtain their submissions as to the response that should be made.  It is then
incumbent on the trial judge to answer the question in a complete and
reasonably detailed manner.  It is unfair to the parties and the jury to
attempt a short form answer to a problem that is obviously presenting
difficulties.  The definitions requested had been adequately set out early in
the charge.  However, memories are short and much had intervened in the way of
directions and recharges before the question was submitted.  The original
instructions should have been repeated in the response.

 

                   R. v. Waite (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 326 (Ont.
C.A.), affirmed [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1436, involved a recharge in response to a
question from the jury approximately two hours into its deliberations.  At
page 329, the Ontario Court of Appeal held:

 

                   It
is reasonable to assume that not all parts of a charge will be remembered with
great particularity by a jury.  A question such as the one posed in this case
indicates an area of concern for the members of the jury.  No matter how
careful and extensive the original directions, the question, focusing as it
does upon the jury's problem, should be answered carefully and completely even
if these later directions seem to be repetitious.

 

                   In
this case, the directions were of great importance for they were given in
response to a question from the jury on a matter that was obviously worrying
them.

 

                   Most recently in R.
v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, and in R. v. Pétel, [1994] 1 S.C.R.
3, this Court recognized that answers to questions from the jury will be given
special emphasis by jurors.  Lamer C.J., writing for the majority in R. v.
Naglik, supra, stated at p. 139:

 

Answers
to questions from the jury are extremely important, and carry influence far
exceeding instructions given in the main charge.  If the jury asks a question
about an issue addressed in the main charge, it is clear that they did not
understand or remember that part of the main charge, and it is also clear that
they must exclusively rely on the answer given by the trial judge to resolve
any confusion or debate on the point which may have taken place in the jury
room during their deliberations up to that point.

 

                   In R. v. Pétel,
supra, Lamer C.J., writing for the majority, stated at p. 15:

 

The
importance of adequately answering questions put by the jury should be borne in
mind:  R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 759-60.  The
question will generally relate to an important point in the jury's reasoning,
so that any error the judge may make in answering it becomes all the more
damaging.  It is often necessary to repeat certain aspects of the main charge
in order to place the specific question in a more general context.

 

                   There can be no
doubt about the significance which must be attached to questions from the jury
and the fundamental importance of giving correct and comprehensive responses to
those questions.  With the question the jury has identified the issues upon
which it requires direction.  It is this issue upon which the jury has
focused.  No matter how exemplary the original charge may have been, it is
essential that the recharge on the issue presented by the question be correct
and comprehensive.  No less will suffice.  The jury has said in effect, on this
issue there is confusion, please help us.  That help must be provided.

 

                   If an error is
made, then as a general rule, the correctness of the original charge cannot be
used to excuse the subsequent error on the very issue upon which the jury seeks
clarification.  It would be irrational to conclude that although the trial
judge has erred on a recharge on the very point on which the jury had been
confused or forgetful, the mistake is of little consequence because some time
ago a correct charge was given.  Such reasoning would be unfair to the jury and
unjust to the parties.  When the jury submits a question it must be assumed
that the jurors have forgotten the original instructions or are in a state of
confusion on the issue.  Their subsequent deliberations will be based on the
answer given to their question.  That is why the recharge must be correct and
why a faultless original charge cannot as a rule rectify a significant mistake
made on the recharge.

 

                   To this I would add
that obviously the greater the passage of time that has elapsed between the
main charge and the question from the jury, the more imperative it is that a
correct and comprehensive answer be given.  Here, four hours had elapsed
between the main charge and the question submitted from the jury.  It was
therefore essential the response be correct and comprehensive.  Let us now
consider the recharge given in this case.

 

Was the Charge
Erroneous?

 

                   In this case all
the evidence presented at trial was that of the complainant and the appellant. 
There was nothing else before the jury.  It therefore was essential that the jury,
which had advised the judge that it was ""hung up"" on the issue of
reasonable doubt, be properly directed with regard to the issue.

 

                   This was vital
since this case turned completely on the question of credibility and the
correct consideration by the jury of the onus of proof resting upon the Crown
of proving the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   In R. v. W. (D.),
supra, this Court considered the manner in which a jury should be
charged on the principle of reasonable doubt.  Writing for the majority, I
attempted to set out a procedure or sequence which would be appropriate in
directing a jury in a case where the accused had testified.  At
pages 757-58 of that case, the following appears:

 

It
is incorrect to instruct a jury in a criminal case that, in order to render a
verdict, they must decide whether they believe the defence evidence or the
Crown's evidence.  Putting this either/or proposition to the jury excludes the
third alternative; namely, that the jury, without believing the accused, after
considering the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole,
may still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

 

                   In
a case where credibility is important, the trial judge must instruct the jury
that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to that issue.  The trial judge
should instruct the jury that they need not firmly believe or disbelieve any
witness or set of witnesses.  Specifically, the trial judge is required to
instruct the jury that they must acquit the accused in two situations. 
First, if they believe the accused.  Second, if they do not believe the
accused's evidence but still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt after
considering the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole. 
See R. v. Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.), approved in R.
v. Morin, supra, at p. 357.

 

                   Ideally,
appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility should be given, not only
during the main charge, but on any recharge.  A trial judge might well instruct
the jury on the question of credibility along these lines:

 

                   First,
if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.

 

                   Second,
if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in
reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.

 

                   Third,
even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask
yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the
accused.

 

If
that formula were followed, the oft repeated error which appears in the
recharge in this case would be avoided.  The requirement that the Crown prove
the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt is fundamental in our system
of criminal law.  Every effort should be made to avoid mistakes in charging the
jury on this basic principle.

 

                   Nonetheless,
the failure to use such language is not fatal if the charge, when read as a
whole, makes it clear that the jury could not have been under any
misapprehension as to the correct burden and standard of proof to apply:  R.
v. Thatcher, supra.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

(See also Linney v. The Queen,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 646, at pp. 650-51.)

 

                   Obviously, it is
not necessary to recite this formula word for word as some magic incantation. 
However, it is important that the essence of these instructions be given.  It
is erroneous to direct a jury that they must accept the Crown's evidence or
that of the defence.  To put forward such an either/or approach excludes the
very real and legitimate possibility that the jury may not be able to select
one version in preference to the other and yet on the whole of the evidence be
left with a reasonable doubt.  The effect of putting such a position to the
jury is to shift a burden to the accused of demonstrating his or her innocence,
since a jury might believe that the accused could not be acquitted unless the
defence evidence was believed.

 

                   It seems to me that
the recharge in this case suffers from the same flaw as the recharge in R.
v. W. (D.), supra.  It will be remembered that in that case the
trial judge instructed the jury on the recharge that the issue that they had to
decide was whether they believed the accused or the complainant.  Directions
such as that exclude what has sometimes been referred to as the ""third
alternative""; namely, that without believing the accused, the jury, upon
considering the evidence of accused in the context of all of the evidence, may
have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

 

                   Running through the
recharge in this case is the notion of choosing between the credibility of the
complainant and that of the accused.  The confusing and erroneous provisions
are underlined in the three paragraphs of the recharge which for convenience
are set out below.

 

1.The
accused is entitled to a reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility; who
is to be believed, either complainant in each of the counts or the accused. 
If you cannot reject his evidence, it must raise a reasonable doubt.  If you
believe his evidence, it raises a reasonable doubt.  If you reject his
evidence, in comparison to the evidence of either of the complainants and that
complainant's evidence is accepted by you as being true, then you convict.

 

2.                It's
as simple to say it as that.  I know it is difficult to work out.  You have two
stories here.  You have to decide whether one is strong enough -- one of the
complainants' evidence is strong enough to convince you of the guilt, and you
can reject the accused's evidence.  If it isn't that strong and you can't
reject the accused's evidence, you must have a reasonable doubt.  If it is that
strong, and you can reject the accused's evidence, you should be able to say, I
am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

3.                Now,
I don't know what -- if you want me to deal with evidence any further, any
point of evidence or just what your duties are with respect to the evidence.  I
will tell you what they are.  You weigh all of the evidence, and you look at
the whole case, and you say, looking at everything, Am I convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is correct and his evidence can't be
accepted, and you do that with each count.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   In the first
paragraph, the trial judge seems to have attempted to put the three‑part
instructions set out in R. v. W. (D.) to the jury.  However, two
problems are apparent.  First, the reference to believing either the
complainant or the accused might have suggested to the jury that all
they had to do was decide which of the accused or the complainant they
believed.  Such an approach would exclude the third alternative, with the
result that the jury would not apply the reasonable doubt standard to the
accused's evidence.  Second, in the last sentence of the first paragraph, the
trial judge refers to rejecting the accused's evidence ""in comparison to
the evidence of either of the complainants"".  This again suggests a
credibility contest, where the jury must choose which of the two versions it
believes.

 

                   The errors in the
second and third paragraphs are more significant.  The approach set out in both
those paragraphs would have conveyed to the jury that they had to believe
either the complainant's evidence or that of the accused.  The jury was told
that if the complainant's evidence was strong enough, they could reject the
evidence of the accused.  From this instruction, the jury would have understood
that they had to decide which story was stronger, and act on that one.  That
approach is incorrect.  It was just this type of either/or approach to
credibility which was rejected in R. v. W. (D.).  It excludes the
""third alternative""; that is to say, that although a jury may not
believe an accused, it may still have a reasonable doubt on the whole of the
evidence.  It shifts the burden of proof  to the accused by telling the jury it
can only acquit if the accused's story is believed rather than that of the
complainant.

 

                   It is true that the
trial judge told the jury several times in the recharge that they had to base
their verdict on ""the whole of the evidence"" and ""the whole of
the case"".  However, in this case the whole of the evidence was the
evidence of the complainant and the accused.  Thus, those words would not have
conveyed  the correct standard of proof to the jury.  Rather they would
indicate that the jury had the choice to believe either the complainant's or
the accused's evidence.  The errors in this recharge could have been avoided if
the trial judge had followed the outline set out in R. v. W. (D.).

 

The Effect of the
Correct Instructions Given During the Main Charge

 

                   It has been seen
that the directions on the recharge on this vitally important issue were in
error.  Nonetheless, it was argued by the respondent that the charge must be
looked at as a whole, and in light of the correct instructions given at the
time of the main charge that the error in the recharge does not constitute a
ground for directing a new trial.  It was argued that the case of R. v. W.
(D.), supra, supported the position of the respondent.  I cannot
agree with that contention.

 

                   In R. v. W. (D.),
there were a number of factors which led to a conclusion that the charge as a
whole would not have misled the jury as to the issue of reasonable doubt.  In
that case the main charge was not only correct but repeated on a number of
occasions the proper directions pertaining to the burden of proof and the issue
of reasonable doubt.  As well there was a very short delay of less then 10
minutes between the main charge and the recharge.  Further the recharge was not
given in response to a question from the jury.  The situation was summarized in
this way at pp. 759-60:

 

                   Fourth,
there was a very short delay between the one-hour long correctly given main
charge and the 11-minute recharge.  The time that elapsed between the end of
the main charge and the beginning of the recharge could not have been more than
ten minutes.

 

                   Fifth,
the recharge was not the result of a question from the jury.  When a jury
submits a question, it gives a clear indication of the problem the jury is
having with a case.  Those questions merit a full, careful and correct
response.  . . .

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

If
the error had occurred in the course of a response to a question from the jury
or if the recharge had been given some hours after the main charge, a new trial
would have to be ordered.  However, in the case at bar, the jury had not yet begun its
deliberations and the main charge, correctly and fairly given, had been
completed just a few minutes earlier.  The correct instructions as to the
burden of proof must have been fresh in the minds of the jury at the time of
the recharge.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   How very different
is the case at bar.  Here the jury had been deliberating for four hours after
the conclusion of the main charge.  Further, not only was there a question from
the jury but it began with the disclosure that the jury was ""hung up""
on the very issue upon which the directions were sought.  In these
circumstances it was essential that clear, correct and comprehensive
instructions be given in response to the question.  The instructions given were
incorrect.  In these circumstances it would be irrational to hold that correct
instructions given four hours earlier could remedy the error.  The only
inference that can be drawn is that the jury followed the directions given in
response to their question.  Those directions were incorrect.  They did not follow
the outline suggested in R. v. W. (D.), supra.

 

                   It follows that a
new trial must be directed.  In light of this conclusion it is not necessary to
consider the question of whether the verdict was unreasonable.

 

Summary

 

                   The manner in which
questions from the jury should be handled may be summarized in this way:

 

                   1.All
questions received from the jury must be considered to be of significance and
important.

 

                   2.Counsel
must be advised of the question and their submissions heard as to the nature
and content of the response.

 

                   3.The
answer to the question must be correct and comprehensive.  Even if the issue
was covered in the original charge it must, in its essence, be repeated even if
this seems to be repetitious.

 

4.No
precise formula need be used but the response to the question must always be
accurate and complete.

 

                   5.The
longer the delay the more important it will be that the recharge be correct and
comprehensive.  As a general rule an error in the recharge on the question
presented will not be saved by a correct charge which was given earlier.  The
question indicates the concern or confusion of the jury.  It is that concern or
confusion which must be correctly addressed on the recharge.

 

Disposition

 

                   The appeal is
allowed.  The order of the Court of Appeal upholding the conviction is set
aside and a new trial is directed.

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. (dissenting) -- In
January 1991, the appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault
against his twin nieces, S.D. and V.D.  The jury convicted him of sexually
assaulting S.D. and acquitted him of sexually assaulting V.D.  The girls were
12 or 13 at the time of the alleged events; the charges were laid three or four
years later.  

 

The Trial

 

                   S.D. testified that
her uncle, who lived in a trailer on her parents' farm, called her by telephone
and asked her to come over to his trailer to ""look at some books"". 
It was evening but still light out.  She went to the trailer and found her
uncle alone inside.  She sat down on the couch in the living room and looked at
some books.  She noticed that her uncle kept moving closer and closer to her on
the couch.  At one point, the cat that had been sitting on her lap jumped off
and the appellant stood up.  He began undoing his pants and pulled them down to
his knees.  He pushed her over on the couch and pulled down her trousers and
underwear, and ""then he got on top of me"".  He began ""playing""
with her breasts and attempted intercourse.  She tried to push him away and
told him to get off her.  She was too scared to attempt to call others.  Just
then, the telephone in the trailer rang.  The appellant pulled up his pants and
went to the kitchen to answer the telephone, and S.D. left the trailer.  

 

                   For her part, V.D.
testified that the appellant had put his arm around her shoulder and fondled
her breast for 10 to 15 minutes.

 

                   The appellant
testified that the events had never occurred.

 

                   The jury was
charged fairly and fully.  After a short period of deliberation, the jury put a
question to the trial judge, which was answered.  About two hours later, the
jury sent a second message to the judge:

 

                   The
jury is hung up and there has been no change in the vote.  We would like an
explanation of the guideline on the jury's duty regarding evidence and
reasonable doubt.  

 

The judge responded,
reinstructing the jury on reasonable doubt and credibility:

 

 

 

The
accused is entitled to a reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility; who
is to be believed, either [the] complainant in each of the counts or the
accused.  If you cannot reject his evidence, it must raise a reasonable
doubt.  If you believe his evidence, it raises a reasonable doubt.  If you
reject his evidence, in comparison to the evidence of either of the
complainants and that complainant's evidence is accepted by you as being
true, then you convict.  

 

                   It's
as simple to say it as that.  I know it is difficult to work out.  You have
two stories here.  You have to decide whether one is strong enough -- one of
the complainants' evidence is strong enough to convince you of the guilt, and
you can reject the accused's evidence.  If it isn't that strong and you can't
reject the accused's evidence, you must have a reasonable doubt.  If it is that
strong, and you can reject the accused's evidence, you should be able to say, I
am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

                   Now,
I don't know what -- if you want me to deal with evidence any further, any
point of evidence or just what your duties are with respect to the evidence.  I
will tell you what they are.  You weigh all of the evidence, and you look at
the whole case, and you say, looking at everything, Am I convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is correct and his evidence can't be
accepted, and you do that with each count.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The jury deliberated 4½ hours more,
and returned with verdicts of guilty on Count 1 (relating to S.D.) and not
guilty on Count 2 (relating to V.D.).

 

The Appeal

 

                   The appellant
appealed his conviction on the charge involving S.D.  to the Alberta Court of
Appeal, alleging: (1) that the trial judge had erred in his response to the
jury's question on evidence and reasonable doubt by telling the jury in effect
that it must choose between two competing versions -- that of the complainants
on the one hand, and that of the accused on the other; and (2) that the verdict
was unreasonable.  The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict, McClung J.A. dissenting. 


 

                   On the first
ground, the Court of Appeal was unanimous in its finding that, viewed globally,
the trial judge did not misdirect the jury. Fraser C.J.A. stated for the court:

 

We
are satisfied that the jury could not have understood that it was obligated to
choose between two competing versions --- that involving the complainant's
evidence on the one hand, and that of the appellant's on the other.  Therefore,
we are unanimously of the view that this ground of appeal must fail. 

 

                   On the second ground,
the majority rejected the submission that the verdict was unreasonable. 
Referring to the alleged weaknesses in S.D.'s  evidence, it concluded that the
jury had before it explanations which it was entitled to accept:

 

. .
.  the jury had ample opportunity to evaluate [S.D.'s] stated explanations for
her actions in the context of all the other evidence in this case.

 

The majority saw no merit in the
allegation that the two verdicts were inconsistent:

 

The
fact that the jury chose to acquit the appellant on one charge of sexual
assault against [S.D.'s] sister, [V.D.], in circumstances essentially unrelated
to the assaults involving [S.D.], is in our view irrelevant.  That decision
does not warrant an acquittal in this case anymore than the jury's conviction
in this case would warrant a conviction on the count involving [V.D.].

 

                   McClung J.A. in
short dissenting reasons expressed the view that the two verdicts were arguably
inconsistent and referred to the fact that S.D. had accepted work after the
alleged events at a resort where her uncle was working as ""difficult to
reconcile with an assault having happened at all"".  He would have allowed
the appeal on the ground that the conviction was ""patently dangerous to
maintain"".

 

                   The appellant
appealed as of right to this Court on the point of law raised by the dissent:
that the verdict was unreasonable.  Leave to appeal was granted on a second
ground of appeal, the alleged error in the judge's answer to the jury question.

 

Analysis

 

The Verdict Issue

 

                   Section 686(1) (a)(i)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , permits a court of appeal
to set aside a conviction where it is unreasonable or not supported by the
evidence:

 

                          686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction . . . the         court of appeal

 

(a)
may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that 

 

(i)
the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
be supported by the evidence,

 

                   I agree with the
majority of the Court of Appeal that this ground of appeal is not made out. 
There was ample evidence before the jury upon which it could convict on the
charge involving S.D.  The alleged frailties in her evidence were explored in
cross-examination and evident to the jury.  The most telling point, it was
said, was that after the alleged incident S.D. accepted a job at a remote lodge
knowing that her uncle was employed there.  Questioned about why she had done
so, S.D. replied that she took the view she should have the right to go and
work where she wanted.  This explanation was before the jury.  The jury was
entitled to accept it.  McClung J.A. apparently would not have accepted it. 
But that task was the jury's.  The fact that a judge might come to a different
conclusion on the evidence than the jury apparently did does not permit a
verdict to be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable.  For further
elaboration on this point, reference may be had to my reasons in R. v.
François, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 827.

 

                   Nor was the verdict
unreasonable by reason of inconsistency.  There was no inconsistency.  The jury
evidently chose to believe one witness testifying to one set of events, while
entertaining a reasonable doubt on another witness's evidence as to other
events. 

 

The Alleged Error in the Judge's
Answer to the Jury's Question 

 

                   The main issue is
whether the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the judge's response to
the jury's question, viewed in conjunction with the main charge, did not offend
the rule against winnowing and competing stories.  

 

                   Although questions
from the jury merit full, careful and correct response, it is a settled
principle that the main charge and recharge must be read as a whole in
determining whether the trial judge misdirected the jury.  As a result, a small
error in a recharge made shortly after a faultless charge might not vitiate a
verdict.  On the other hand, a significant error in response to a question at a
time when the original instructions may have dimmed in the jury's memory might
vitiate the trial: see R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.  The task of
the Court of Appeal is to determine whether the jury might have been misled by
the alleged error, taking into account all relevant circumstances.

 

                   In the case at bar,
an error in the recharge could not be saved by the fact that the judge had
correctly charged the jury in the first instance.  The recharge was in answer
to a question which may heighten its significance: R. v. Desveaux
(1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (Ont. C.A.), per Cory J.A.; R. v. Waite
(1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 326 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1436; R. v.
Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122; and R. v. Pétel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, per
Lamer C.J.   Moreover, it came some hours after the main charge.

 

                   It is therefore
necessary to consider whether in fact the trial judge erred in recharging the
jury.  The reproach brought against the recharge is that the trial judge
defined reasonable doubt in terms of an either-or proposition -- either you
believe the complainant or you believe the appellant.  This would be contrary
to the principle that the jury may accept all of a witness's evidence, part of
a witness's evidence, or none of a witness's evidence.  It would also be
contrary to the obligation of the jury to acquit if any of the evidence, even
that which they may not unequivocally accept, leaves them with a reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of the accused.  As Cory J. put it in R. v. W. (D.),
supra, at pp. 757-58:

 

A
trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along
these lines:

 

                   First,
if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.

 

                   Second,
if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable
doubt by it, you must acquit.

 

                   Third,
even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask
yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the
accused.

 

In short, the appellant's argument is
that the second and/or the third branch of Cory J.'s statement was not put to
the jury.

 

                   I note in passing
that the second branch as stated by Cory J.  has given rise to some academic
debate: J. Gibson, ""The Liars' Defence"" (1993), 20 C.R. (4th) 96; A.
D. Gold, ""The `Average, Nervous, Inadequate, Inarticulate, in Short,
Typical' Accused's Defence"" (1993), 22 C.R. (4th) 253; J. L. Gibson,
""Misquote Changes Meaning"" (1994), 24 C.R. (4th) 395; and A. D. Gold,
""Typo Does Not Change Anything"" (1994), 24 C.R. (4th) 397.  It has
been suggested that if one rejects the evidence of the accused, it is logically
inconsistent to have a reasonable doubt with respect to it.  Such a doubt, it is
argued, would not be reasonable.  Certainly if the jury rejected (as opposed to
merely being undecided about) all of the evidence of the accused, it is
difficult to see how that very evidence, having been rejected, could raise a
reasonable doubt.  However, a jury could reject part of the evidence of the
accused and still reasonably entertain a doubt as to his guilt based on other
parts of the accused's evidence, which the jury did not reject, but either
accepted or was undecided about.  It is in the latter sense that I read the
second condition of Cory J.  I note also that immediately preceding his
three-part statement of the rule, Cory J. states the rule in two branches,
rolling the second and third branch of the three-part statement into one (at p.
757):

 

Specifically,
the trial judge is required to instruct the jury that they must acquit
the accused in two situations.  First, if they believe the accused.  Second, if
they do not believe the accused's evidence but still have a reasonable doubt as
to his guilt after considering the accused's evidence in the context of the
evidence as a whole.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   I raise this point
only for one purpose: when scholars of the criminal law themselves argue about
how the second branch of the W. (D.) test should be phrased, it would be
wrong to reverse a conviction merely because a particular formula was not
repeated verbatim.  We must remember that jurors are laypeople, not lawyers,
and do not hear and interpret each and every word of the judge's charge with
all the legal baggage that a career in the law may engender.  An overly
legalistic focus on the strict text of the judge's charge does not take this
courtroom reality into account, nor accommodate the fact that the judge may
have to formulate his or her remarks in various ways in order to make the jury
understand that it must acquit regardless of what evidence it may accept or
reject if it is left with a reasonable doubt when considering that evidence as
a whole.  What is required, to quote Sopinka J. in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 345, at p. 362, is that the ""charge alerts [the jury] to the fact
that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after considering
it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to acquit"".

 

                   Against this
backdrop, I return to the judge's recharge to the jury in this case.  The judge
told the jury several times during the recharge that proof beyond a reasonable
doubt could only be arrived at by weighing all of the evidence.  In other
words, the jury could not resolve the case simply by deciding whether it
believed the complainant or the accused.  The trial judge did, however, at one
point make the following statement:

 

The
accused is entitled to a reasonable doubt on the issue of credibility; who is
to be believed, either [the] complainant in each of the counts or the accused. 
If you cannot reject his evidence, it must raise a reasonable doubt.  If you
believe his evidence, it raises a reasonable doubt.  If you reject his
evidence, in comparison to the evidence of either of the complainants and that
complainant's evidence is accepted by you as being true, then you convict.

 

While the last sentence in this
passage at first glance seems to contradict the second and/or third branch of
Cory J.'s three-part test in W. (D.), it was not incorrect on the facts
of this case.  Since the only witnesses were the complainant and the accused,
total rejection of all the accused's evidence coupled with acceptance of the
complainant's evidence would leave no evidence upon which a reasonable
doubt could be based.  Any doubt would not be founded on the evidence and would
therefore be unreasonable.  So this aspect of the trial judge's instruction was
not in error.

 

                   Any doubt was
removed by the passages that followed immediately after, which make it clear
that at the end of the day, whether it accepts or rejects the accused's
evidence, the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt:

 

You
have to decide whether . . . [the complainant's] evidence is strong enough to
convince you of the guilt, and you can reject the accused's evidence. 
If it isn't that strong and you can't reject the accused's evidence, you must
have a reasonable doubt.  If it is that strong, and you can reject the
accused's evidence, you should be able to say, I am convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

                   In this passage,
the trial judge expressly tells the jury that their task is not concluded if
they reject the accused's evidence.  They must go on to ask themselves the
further question of whether they entertain a reasonable doubt.  This complies
fully with the second and/or third branch of Cory J.'s  three-part test in R.
v. W. (D.).  My colleague Cory J., relying on this passage, says (at p.
535) ""[t]he jury was told that if the complainant's evidence was strong
enough, they could reject the evidence of the accused"".   With respect, I
cannot read the passage in this way.  The trial judge did not say that
acceptance of the complainant's evidence would allow the jury to reject the accused's
evidence.  Rather he was addressing the possibility that the jury might (1)
find the complainant's evidence strong enough to establish guilt, and (2)
reject the evidence of the accused.  This purpose was to tell the jury that
even in that situation, it could not convict unless it could say, ""we are
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt"".  The trial judge went on to
emphasize the need to look at all the evidence in determining reasonable doubt:

 

You
weigh all of the evidence, and you look at the whole case, and you say, looking
at everything, Am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence is
correct and his evidence can't be accepted, and you do that with each
count.  [Emphasis added.]

 

With all due respect, it would appear
that Justice Cory has interpreted the above two excerpts of the judge's charge
to read as follows:

 

You
have to decide whether . . . [the complainant's] evidence is strong enough to
convince you of the guilt, so that you can reject the accused's
evidence.  If it isn't that strong and you can't reject the accused's evidence,
you must have a reasonable doubt.  If it is that strong, so that you can
reject the accused's evidence, you should be able to say, I am convinced beyond
a reasonable doubt.

                                                                     

You
weigh all of the evidence, and you look at the whole case, and you say, looking
at everything, Am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence is
correct so that his evidence can't be accepted, and you do that with
each count.  [Emphasis added to substituted term.]

 

 

Admittedly, there is no way of knowing
for sure the impression left on the jury by these portions of the recharge.  On
balance, however, when the actual remarks are placed in the context of the
totality of the judge's recharge, I would lean towards saying that the
impression left on the jury was consistent with the words actually used in the
judge's recharge and not with the possible interpretation raised by Cory J.

 

                   Finally, I note
that the fact that the jury convicted the appellant on one count and acquitted
him on the other is consistent with the view that the jury understood that it
had to acquit if it was left in reasonable doubt, whether or not it believed
the testimony of the accused.

 

                   Having considered
the impugned passages of the trial judge's recharge and found them not to
violate the requirements of law, I turn to the question of whether viewed
globally the trial judge over-emphasized the credibility contest between the
complainant and the accused.  I cannot conclude that he did.  He repeatedly
told the jury that they must look to all of the evidence in determining
reasonable doubt.  He indicated that Crown evidence which they accepted might
nevertheless leave them with a reasonable doubt, and that rejection of the
accused's evidence still left open the possibility of a reasonable doubt. 
These propositions are inconsistent with the view that the jury's task was to
choose between the complainant on the one hand and the accused on the other.  In
the context of this case, where the only Crown witnesses were the complainants
and the only defence witness was the accused, explanation of the law and how it
applied necessarily involved reference to the evidence of the complainants on
the one hand and the evidence of the accused on the other.  But provided that
the jury was clearly advised that the case was not a simple credibility contest
and that after having considered all the evidence it must consider whether it
was left with any reasonable doubt, mention of the competing versions before
the jury was not in error.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   Iacobucci J. ‑‑ At issue in this
appeal is the constitutionality of s. 85  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  We are all of the view that the appeal
should be allowed on the basis of the principles recently decided by the Court
in R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485.  In Goltz, the majority of
the Court held that a two‑stage test should be employed to evaluate the
constitutionality of a legislative sentencing provision under s. 12  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The first stage is to view the
provision in question from the perspective of the accused, and on the facts of
this case, which involved three armed robberies using a shotgun, the provision
clearly does not offend s. 12 .

 

                   The second stage
involves considering reasonable hypotheticals involving the offence underlying
the sentence in the case before the court.  Here, the Attorney General of Manitoba
limited its defence of s. 85  to the case which concerns armed robbery as
the underlying offence.  As such, the hypothetical proposed by the respondent
relating to mischief is not a reasonable hypothetical envisioned by Goltz. 
We agree with these submissions and would therefore find no violation of
s. 12  of the Charter .

 

                   Accordingly, the
appeal is allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba is set
aside, the cross‑appeal is dismissed, and the trial judge's calculation
of the respondent's sentence is restored.

 

                   We would answer the
constitutional questions as follows:

 

Questions
1 and 3:  No, when the underlying offence is robbery.  The operation of s. 85 
in conjunction with other potential underlying indictable offences is not at
issue in this appeal and no answer is required regarding the validity of s. 85 
in conjunction with such other offences.

 

Questions
2 and 4:  These questions do not arise.

 

 

                   Appeal allowed and
cross‑appeal dismissed.  The first and third constitutional questions
should be answered in the negative; the second and fourth did not arise.

                   English version of
the judgment of La Forest, Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. delivered
by

 

                   Sopinka J. ‑‑ This appeal as of
right is based on the dissent of Lacourcière J.A. of the Ontario Court of
Appeal:  (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 214, 66 O.A.C. 155.  His dissent was limited to
the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 .  In the recent case R. v. Haughton,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 516, at p. 516-17, this Court stated as follows:

 

                   The
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , requires the Court to consider whether a jury
properly instructed could, acting reasonably, have come to a different
conclusion absent the error.  In applying this test the findings of the jury in
the case under appeal may be a factor in determining what the hypothetical
reasonable jury would have done, provided those findings are not tainted by the
error.

 

                   In the case at bar
we agree with Arbour J.A. that the trial judge found that each count had
been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, before proceeding to analyze the similar
fact evidence.  Charron J. said the following:

 

                   [translation]  The testimony
of the two complainants convinces me with respect to the alleged offences and
the testimony of the accused does not raise a reasonable doubt in my mind.

 

([1992]
O.J. No. 1380 (QL), at para. 58.)

 

We are of the view that this
conclusion was not vitiated by any error.  Given the importance of this factor
in the context of the evidence in this case, we conclude that a properly
instructed jury could not, acting reasonably, have come to a different
conclusion if the similar fact evidence had not been admitted.

 

                   In view of this
conclusion it is not necessary to consider the alternative question of the
admissibility of similar facts.  At the conclusion of the hearing the Court
rendered judgment from the bench dismissing the appeal.

 

                   English version of
the reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. delivered by

 

                   Gonthier J. ‑‑ While I agree that
this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Justice Sopinka,
I am also of the view that the trial judgment contains no clear and manifest
error of law or error of fact, whether in the treatment of the evidence as a
whole or in the assessment of similar facts, and that accordingly there is no
basis for reviewing that judgment on appeal.  I would also dismiss the appeal
on this ground.

                   Respondent's
earlier convictions of sexual assault involving children made him subject to
the prohibition in s. 179(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  that he
not commit vagrancy by loitering near playgrounds, school yards or public
parks.  On two occasions, respondent, who was carrying a camera with a
telephoto lens in a public park near to where children were playing, was
stopped by police and questioned as to whether he had a criminal record.  On
the first occasion, he was warned that a convicted sex offender was not
permitted to loiter near a public park, school yard or playground.  On the
second, he was arrested and charged under s. 179(1)(b) of the Code
with two counts of vagrancy ‑‑ ""at or near a playground""
and ""in or near a public park"" ‑‑ and the camera and film
with frames focusing on the crotch areas of young girls playing in the park
with their clothing in disarray were seized.

 

                   The respondent was
convicted of the first count.  The trial judge found that, even though
s. 179(1) (b) infringed ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter ,
these infringements were a justifiable limitation under s. 1 .  The
second count was conditionally stayed under the Kienapple principle.  An
appeal to the British Columbia Supreme Court was dismissed.  The Court of
Appeal, however, allowed respondent's appeal and quashed the conviction because
the breaches of ss. 7  and 11 (d) were not justified.  The
constitutional questions before this Court queried if s. 179(1) (b)
infringed several sections of the Charter , and if so, whether those
infringements were justifiable under s. 1 .  The Charter  provisions
allegedly infringed were:  s. 7  (the right to life, liberty and security
of the person), s. 11 (d) (the right to be presumed innocent),
s. 12  (the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or
punishment), s. 9  (the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned)
and s. 11 (h) (the right not to be tried and punished for the same
offence if already found guilty and punished for that offence).

 

                   Held (La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed. 
Section 179(1) (b) violated s. 7  of the Charter  and was not
justified under s. 1 .

                   

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory,
Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  The word ""loiter"" in s. 179(1) (b)
should be given its ordinary meaning ‑‑ to stand idly around, hang
around, linger, tarry, saunter, delay, dawdle ‑‑ and should not be
interpreted as requiring a malevolent intent.  None of the dictionary
definitions requires a malevolent intent or makes any reference to such a
requirement and the jurisprudence considering its meaning in other sections of
the Code supports the use of the ordinary meaning in s. 179(1) (b). 
The ordinary definition is also consistent with section's purpose of protecting
children from becoming victims of sexual offences by prohibiting any prolonged
attendance in areas often frequented by children.

 

                   The concept of
malevolent intent (as opposed to a narrower formula such as unlawful intent)
raises problems of definition which make it unworkable.  It is a concept of
very broad scope that is extremely difficult to define.  Malevolent intent
could mean almost anything, and its definition would be dependent upon the
subjective views of the particular judge trying the case.

 

                   The legislative
debates both on the provision's enactment and later on its reconsideration
cannot be used to support the notion of some sort of malevolent intent.  These
debates, assuming admissibility, were inconclusive for the purpose of
determining legislative intent.  Indeed, legislative history generally is not
admissible as proof of legislative intent in the construction of statutes
because it is not reliable evidence.  Rather, it may be admissible for the more
general purpose of showing the mischief Parliament was attempting to remedy
with the legislation.

 

                   Section 179(1) (b)
restricts the liberty of those to whom it applies.  Although a prohibition for
the purpose of protecting the public does not per se infringe the
principles of fundamental justice, the prohibition in s. 179(1) (b)
does so because it restricts liberty far more than is necessary to accomplish
its goal.  It applies, without prior notice to the accused, to too many places,
to too many people, for an indefinite period with no possibility of review.

 

                   Overbreadth and vagueness
are different concepts, but are sometimes related in particular cases.  They
are related in that both are the result of a lack of sufficient precision by a
legislature in the means used to accomplish an objective.  In the case of
vagueness, the means are not clearly defined.  In the case of overbreadth, the
means are too sweeping in relation to the objective.

 

                   Overbreadth
analysis looks at the means chosen by the state in relation to its purpose.  A
court must consider whether those means are necessary to achieve the state
objective.  If the state, in pursuing a legitimate objective, uses means which
are broader than is necessary to accomplish that objective, the principles of
fundamental justice will be violated because the individual's rights will have
been limited for no reason.  The effect of overbreadth is that in some
applications the law is arbitrary or disproportionate.

 

                   Reviewing
legislation for overbreadth as a principle of fundamental justice is simply a
matter of balancing the state interest against that of the individual.  Where
an independent principle of fundamental justice is violated, however, any
balancing of the public interest must take place under s. 1  of the Charter . 
In analysing a statutory provision to determine if it is overbroad, a measure
of deference must be paid to the means selected by the legislature.  A court
should not interfere with legislation merely because a judge might have chosen
a different means of accomplishing the objective.

 

                   Section 7  of the Charter 
has a wide scope.  An enactment, before it can be found to be so broad that it
infringes s. 7  of the Charter , must clearly infringe life, liberty
or security of the person in a manner that is unnecessarily broad, going beyond
what is needed to accomplish the governmental objective.  In determining
whether a provision is overly broad and not in accordance with the principles
of fundamental justice, it must be determined whether the means chosen to
accomplish the provision's objectives are reasonably tailored to effect its
purpose.  Where legislation limits the liberty of an individual in order to
protect the public, that limitation should not go beyond what is necessary to
accomplish that goal.

 

                   Section
 179(1)(b) suffers from overbreadth and thus the deprivation of
liberty it entails is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.  The section is overly broad in its geographical ambit.  The
limitation should be more narrowly defined, to apply only to those parks and
bathing areas where children can reasonably be expected to be present.  It is
also overly broad in that it applies for life, with no possibility of review. 
Without a review a person who has ceased to be a danger to children (or who
indeed never was a danger to children) continues to be subject to the
prohibition in s. 179(1)(b).  A pardon under the Criminal
Records Act  or the royal prerogative of mercy, while removing only any
disqualification flowing from conviction, does not meet the need for review
because of inadequate and insufficient availability.  Finally, s. 179(1)(b)
applies to all persons convicted of the listed offences, without regard to
whether they constitute a danger to children and accordingly is also overly
broad in respect to the people to whom it applies.

 

                   The absence of
notice, too, offends the principles of fundamental justice.  Great care is
taken to give notice in connection with other provisions of the Code.

 

                   It is significant
that the new s. 161, enacted after the Court of Appeal's decision, applies
only to persons who have committed the listed offences in respect of persons
under age fourteen.  In addition, the order made pursuant to it is discretionary
so that only those offenders constituting a danger to children will be subject
to a prohibition.  Unlike s. 179(1)(b), the new s. 161 provides for both
notice and review of the prohibition and accordingly reduces the significance
of the overbreadth factor.

 

 

                   Doubts exist as to
whether a violation of the right to life, liberty or security of the person
which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice can ever
be justified, except perhaps in times of war or national emergencies. 
Overbroad legislation infringing s. 7  of the Charter  is even more
difficult to justify and would appear to be incapable of passing the minimal
impairment branch of the s. 1  analysis.

 

                   The objective of
s. 179(1)(b) of protecting children from sexual offences is
pressing and substantial.  The protection of children from sexual offenses is
obviously very important to society.  Furthermore, the means employed in
s. 179(1)(b), at least in some of their applications, are
rationally connected to the objective.  However, for the same reasons that
s. 179(1)(b) is overly broad, it fails the minimal impairment
branch of the s. 1  analysis and so cannot be justified under s. 1  of
the Charter .

 

                   The remedies of
reading in or reading down are not appropriate here.  The changes which would
be required to make s. 179(1)(b) constitutional would not
constitute reading down or reading in but rather would amount to judicial
rewriting of the legislation and the creation of an entirely new scheme with a
completely different approach to the problem.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. (dissenting):  Section 179(1)(b)
should be interpreted as prohibiting the persons affected from being in one of
the enumerated places for a malevolent or ulterior purpose related to the
predicate offences.  The purpose and legislative history of s. 179(1)(b),
precedent and statutory context support this interpretation.

 

                   The legislative
history of s. 179(1)(b) indicated that Parliament considered the word
""loiter"" to have a different meaning from the word ""wander""
which was removed from earlier versions of the provision.  ""Wander""
connotes movement without specific intent; ""loiter"", notwithstanding
the common element of idleness, is defined more narrowly and has a variable connotation
according to the context.  

 

                   The Crown's expert
psychiatric and psychological evidence was of assistance in understanding the
purpose and scope of s. 179(1)(b).  The evidence on cross‑offending
and the difficulty of predicting who will cross‑offend or repeat offend
justifies some form of restriction on the liberty of persons convicted of
sexual offences.

 

                   The section has at
its foundation a concern for public safety and a desire to aid in the treatment
and rehabilitation of offenders.  It applies broadly to all persons convicted
of the enumerated offences and therefore provides protection not only to
children but also to others who could be victims of sexual assault in the
listed areas.  The areas where the prohibition applies are places where people
will generally lower their guard.

 

A
caveat to the general rule that words be given their ordinary meaning arises
because the sense of the term ""loiter"" varies according to its
context.  The absence of purpose element in the ordinary meaning of loiter can
have no application in the context of s. 179(1)(b).  Parliament
clearly intended to include conduct of convicted sex offenders whose purpose
was related to re‑offending.

 

                   The prohibition
contained in s. 179(1)(b) should be narrowed to render the
prohibition less intrusive and to tailor it more carefully to the objectives
being pursued.  Not all loitering should be caught by its prohibition contained
in s. 179(1)(b).  Rather, the intrusion into the activities of
individuals should be tied to some reason of public order.  The concern to
exclude presence in the enumerated areas for legitimate purposes from criminal
prohibition is well‑founded.  The restriction created by s. 179(1)(b)
will not be the same in each of the listed areas.

 

                   Analysis of the
interaction of other provisions of the Code dealing with a similar
subject‑matter supports the interpretation that loitering as used in
s. 179(1)(b) requires a malevolent purpose.  Sections 179(1)(b)
and 810.1 read together, however, produce a similar result to that achieved by
s. 161 in relation to those convicted prior to the enactment of
s. 161.  (Section 161 allows a court at the time of sentencing to
make an order prohibiting a sexual offender from attending day care centres,
school grounds, playgrounds, community centres, or any public park or swimming
area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably
be expected to be present.  The s. 161 prohibition is available only in
relation to persons who have committed offences against children under age
14.)  Section 810.1 allows an application to be made to the provincial court,
where there are reasonable grounds to fear that someone will commit certain
sexual offences, for an order prohibiting that person from attending areas
where children under age 14 are likely to be present.  Section 179(1)(b)
allows the police to take immediate preventative steps before a previous offender
re-offends.  

 

                   The two primary Charter 
concerns raised in relation to s. 179(1) (b) pertain to vagueness
and overbreadth.  Defining loitering in that section as being in an enumerated
place for a malevolent or ulterior purpose related to the predicated offences
avoids both these problems.  A lifetime prohibition of activities with a
malevolent or ulterior purpose related to re‑offending is not 
objectionable or over‑broad.  Such a prohibition would impose a
restriction on the liberty of the affected individuals to which ordinary
citizens are not subject, but that restriction is directly related to
preventing re‑offending.  The affected persons' history of offending, the
uncertainties prevalent in treating offenders and a desire to disrupt the cycle
of re‑offending justify this minor intrusion which does not breach the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   Section 7  of the Charter 
was not violated by the absence of any notice of the prohibition contained in
s. 179(1) (b).  Even though formal notice of the content of
s. 179(1) (b) might be preferable, Parliament's decision to provide
notice in respect of certain Criminal Code  prohibitions cannot be
transformed into a principle of fundamental justice.

 

                   The allegation that
s. 179(1)(b) violates ss. 9 , 11 (d), (h) and 12 
of the Charter  are without foundation.  The absence of notice, for
reasons similar to those relating to overbreadth, did not violate the s. 9 
Charter  guarantee against being arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.  The
s. 11 (d) Charter  right to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty was not infringed either for s. 179(1) (b) does not assume
recidivism but rather provides the means to prevent it.  Anyone charged under
s. 179(1) (b) will be presumed innocent and the burden remains on
the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the
offence as interpreted.  The s. 11 (h) right against double jeopardy
was not violated.  Section 179(1) (b) applies to persons identified
by the fact of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offences.  Any
conviction under that section, however, will be based on violating its terms
and not of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offences.  Finally,
the respondent was not the subject of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment
contrary to s. 12  of the Charter .  Such punishment or treatment
must be ""so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency"" or have
an effect ""grossly disproportionate to what would have been
appropriate"".  The lifetime prohibition of activities with a malevolent or
ulterior purpose related to re‑offending, however, is both a minor and
justifiable restraint of the affected persons' liberty.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- Section 179(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , as amended,
makes it a crime for persons convicted of specified offences to be ""found
loitering in or near a school ground, playground, public park or bathing
area"".  It must be determined whether the section infringes ss. 7  or
11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

Facts

 

                   The respondent was
charged with two counts of vagrancy under s. 179(1) (b) alleging
that on or about July 5, 1989, he did commit vagrancy by loitering at Beacon
Hill Park in Victoria.  The first count was framed as loitering ""at or
near a playground"".  The second count, which referred to the same events,
was framed as loitering ""in or near a public park"".

 

                   In 1987 the
respondent was convicted of two counts of sexual assault contrary to the former
s. 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34.  These convictions made him subject to the prohibition set out in
s. 179(1) (b).

 

                   On June 16, 1989,
for about two minutes, Police Constable Ronald German observed the respondent
standing in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria, British Columbia at the edge of a
playground area.  Around his neck the respondent was carrying a camera with a
telephoto lens.  The constable did not see the respondent take any pictures or
approach or speak to any children.  The respondent then went to another area of
the park.  Constable German followed the respondent and called to him.  The
respondent stopped, and German identified himself and produced his badge.  He
asked the respondent what he was doing in the park.  The respondent replied
that he was walking through the park just as he did every day.

 

                   After some further
discussion, the officer asked the respondent for his address, date of birth,
and if he had a criminal record.  The respondent replied that he had a criminal
record for sexual assault.  Constable German then told the respondent that his
hanging around the park was contrary to the vagrancy section of the Code,
and that a convicted sex offender was not permitted to loiter near a public
park, school yard or playground.  The respondent asked the officer what he
meant by ""loitering"", to which Constable German very astutely
replied:  ""loitering meant standing around, apparently doing nothing,
standing stationary in a location, or moving slowly in a certain area, stopping
at regular intervals and standing around, or else loitering also could mean
stopping in a location where it would obstruct persons who use that area too [sic]
frequent"".  The officer did not charge the respondent, but warned him not
to loiter near the playground at the park again.

 

                   On the afternoon of
July 5, 1989, Constable Wayne Coleman observed the respondent walking on a
pathway leading from the children's playground area in the Beacon Hill Park
towards the petting zoo.  After stopping there for a few minutes, the
respondent went to his car.  The respondent was once again carrying a camera
with a large lens.  Constable Coleman, who was in plain-clothes, followed the
respondent in an unmarked police car.  After driving around for approximately
half an hour, the respondent returned to the park.  There, the officer saw the
respondent seated at a table approximately 50 yards from the playground
area.  He then moved to a bench approximately 20 yards from the playground
and appeared to be using his camera.  Some five minutes later, the respondent
left the park and returned to his car.  Constable Coleman followed the
respondent to his residence, where he arrested Heywood and charged him with
vagrancy.  The police seized his camera and film.  A search warrant was subsequently
executed at his residence.  A picture on the film found in the camera, and a
number of pictures found in the respondent's residence and at the drugstore
where he had his photographs developed, showed young girls playing in the park,
their clothing disarranged from play so that the area of their crotch, although
covered by underclothes, was visible.

 

                   At his trial, the
respondent pleaded not guilty and challenged the constitutionality of
s. 179(1) (b) on the grounds that it infringed ss. 7 , 11 (d),
(h), 12  and 15  of the Charter .  The trial judge found that
s. 179(1) (b) violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter ,
but that it was a justifiable limit under s. 1 .  The respondent was
convicted of the first count of vagrancy under s. 179(1) (b).  The
second count was conditionally stayed pursuant to the principle expressed in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  The respondent was sentenced to three
months incarceration to be followed by three years probation.  The respondent
appealed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which dismissed his appeal. 
The Supreme Court judge accepted the trial judge's finding that s. 179(1) (b)
violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter , but like the trial
judge found that they were justified under s. 1 .

 

                   The respondent
appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal allowed
the respondent's appeal, and quashed the conviction.  Hutcheon J.A. (Rowles
J.A. concurring) accepted the breaches of ss. 7  and 11 (d) as found
by the lower courts.  Southin J.A. only found a breach of s. 7 .  All three
judges of the Court of Appeal found that s. 179(1) (b) was not
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  The Crown appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court.

 

Relevant Legislation

 

                   Section 179(1) (b)
provides that:

 

179.  (1)  Every one
commits vagrancy who

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(b)  having
at any time been convicted of an offence under section 151, 152 or 153,
subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 271, 272 or 273, or of an offence
under a provision referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition
""serious personal injury offence"" in section 687  of the Criminal
Code , chapter C‑34 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, as
it read before January 4, 1983, is found loitering in or near a school
ground, playground, public park or bathing area.

 

                   The definition of
""serious personal injury offence"" in s. 687  of the Criminal
Code , as it read before January 4, 1983, was as follows:

 

                   687.  . . .

 

(b)  an
offence mentioned in section 144 (rape) or 145 (attempted rape) or an offence
or attempt to commit an offence mentioned in section 146 (sexual intercourse
with a female under fourteen or between fourteen and sixteen), 149 (indecent
assault on a female), 156 (indecent assault on a male) or 157 (gross
indecency).

 

Judgments

 

Provincial Court (Filmer Prov. Ct. J.)

 

                   The trial judge
found that s. 179(1)(b) of the Code violated s. 7  of
the Charter  because it was ""an impediment on the freedom and liberty
of persons who have been previously convicted of the enumerated sections of the
Criminal Code "".  He also found that s. 179(1) (b)
violated s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  However, he concluded
that s. 179(1) (b) could be saved under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   The trial judge
found that the word ""loiter"" in s. 179(1) (b) did not
connote innocent behaviour; rather, there must be an untoward or improper
motive.  In his opinion that motive did not need to be illegal.  It was
sufficient if it was ""malevolent"", or something a reasonable person
would not consider innocent.  In light of this interpretation of the word
""loiter"", the trial judge found that s. 179(1) (b) was
justified under s. 1  of the Charter .  He held that the objective of
the section, namely protecting children and vulnerable persons from those
within the community who might be sexually predatory, was pressing and
substantial and that the means chosen were rationally connected to this
objective.

 

                   Based on the
evidence of the photographs taken by the respondent, the trial judge found that
the respondent did not have an innocent purpose for being in the park.  He
stated:

 

                   It
is my view that the conduct of [the respondent] transcended the bounds of what
is harmless and innocent.  His conduct pandered to a purely prurient interest;
that is, it arose from indulgence in lewd ideas.  Lewd in this context means
that it involved obscenity, indecency, or lasciviousness of thought.  Such
conduct is so reprehensible in my view no reasonable person could characterize
it as innocent or lawful.  As I said when reviewing the constitutionality of
this section, the section is not intended to limit innocent attendances or
attendances where a lawful purpose is involved.  I cannot find such a purpose
exists here.

 

                   He further noted
that the provisions of the Criminal Records Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑47 ,
applied to permit a person who was subject to s. 179(1) (b) to
obtain a pardon so that they would no longer be subject to the prohibition.  He
found that this provision acted as a safeguard against the unfair application
of s. 179(1) (b).

 

Supreme Court (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 46 (Melvin J.)

 

                   Melvin J. held at
p. 56 that the meaning of the word ""loiter"" should be determined
""by reference to the general use of the word in everyday language as found
in dictionaries, other sections in the same statutory enactment, and in the
context of the offence section itself"".  He found, at pp. 57-58,
that:

 

                   I
am satisfied that the word ""loiter"" in s. 179(1) (b)
requires the existence of some unlawful, or evil, or malevolent intention or
purpose on the part of the accused to complete the offence.  Such an
interpretation of the section demonstrates that a guilty mind is an essential
component of the offence which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. 
It is not sufficient to convict an individual under this section, in my view,
of loitering on the basis that he attended at a park and sat watching flowers
grow or ducks swim.  There must be more to his conduct which will demonstrate
an untoward or improper purpose.

 

He then concluded that the
respondent's purpose was not innocent and it was that purpose or state of mind
which brought him within the definition of ""loitering"" in
s. 179(1) (b).

 

                   The appeal before
Melvin J. was argued on the basis that the trial judge was correct to find
violations of ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  On this
basis, he accepted that s. 179(1) (b) violated ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .  However, after reviewing the expert evidence he was
satisfied that s. 179(1) (b) was justified under s. 1  of the Charter . 
He stated, at p. 63, that:

 

The
objective, namely, the controlling of the impulses of potential reoffenders and
the protection of the public, is of great importance and clearly justifies
overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom, such as found in
s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  When one considers the means
chosen under those circumstances, if the section contains an evil or malevolent
intent as a component to be demonstrated by the evidence led on behalf of the
[appellant], then the proportionality test in R. v. Oakes is satisfied
as the measures are designed to achieve their objective and are rationally
connected with that objective and have little impairment of the rights or
freedom in question.

 

                   As a result of his
conclusions he dismissed the respondent's appeal.

 

Court of Appeal (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 502

 

                   Hutcheon
J.A., Rowles J.A. concurring

 

                   In the Court of
Appeal the Crown accepted the trial judge's finding that the provisions of
s. 179(1) (b) violated ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
Hutcheon J.A. proceeded on this basis and as a result dealt only with the
question as to whether the section was saved by s. 1  of the Charter . 
He concluded that it was not.

 

                   Hutcheon J.A.
carefully reviewed the jurisprudence pertaining to the word ""loiter""
and determined that there was no support for the position that the word implies
an evil or malevolent intent.  He wrote at p. 509:

 

I
cannot find any support in those authorities for the proposition that the word
""loiter"" implies an evil or malevolent intent or purpose or an untoward
or improper motive.  Moreover, I question whether the taking of the photographs
would qualify as an evil or malevolent intent.  To be a criminal offence under
the Criminal Code , the intent must be directed toward the corruption of
others, not oneself.

 

                   He observed that
the objectives of s. 179(1) (b) were to control the impulses of
potential re‑offenders and to protect the public.  However, he found at
p. 511 that the lack of a provision for notice in s. 179(1) (b)
caused the means chosen to achieve the objectives of s. 179(1) (b)
""to be unfair and not carefully designed to achieve the two
objectives"".  Thus, they were not justified under s. 1 .  Hutcheon
J.A. stated that the Crown could not invoke s. 19 of the Code since
s. 179(1) (b) was not a provision applicable to everyone.  He
concluded, at p. 511, that:

 

                   Our
system of criminal justice could not operate if accused persons could raise the
defence that they did not know it was contrary to the law to steal or to
assault someone or to defraud.  But if the fundamental liberty of movement of a
particular group, convicted sexual offenders, is to be controlled, proper
notice of the prohibition to the members of that group is an essential element
of the control.  Because of lack of a provision for notice I have concluded
that s. 179(1) (b) is inconsistent with the Constitution, in the
words of s. 52, and is of no force and effect.  Section 179(1) (b)
is not the law of which one could be ignorant.

 

                   In
other words, s. 19  has no application if no offence has been committed and
that is the result in this case of declaring s. 179(1)(b) to be of
no force or effect.  Nothing of s. 179(1) (b) is left to be saved by
s. 19 .

 

                   Southin
J.A. (concurring)

 

                   Southin J.A. agreed
with Hutcheon and Rowles JJ.A. that the word ""loiter"" did not imply
any evil or malevolent intent.  She then considered whether s. 179(1) (b)
violated either ss. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter .  She found
that the section did not violate s. 11 (d) because the Crown had to
prove the prior conviction and that the accused was ""loitering"" at
one of the prohibited places.

 

                   Southin J.A. was of
the view at p. 523 that Parliament, in the exercise of the authority
conferred by s. 91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 , could
""attach new disabilities to persons convicted of a crime"".  Southin
J.A. stated that, although s. 179(1) (b) did not expressly say that a
person convicted of a sexual crime could not go to certain places, she was
proceeding on the basis that it was a form of prohibition.  She found that a
measure imposing a disability has aspects of both punishment and prevention. 
She noted that the purpose of s. 179(1) (b) was to protect young
persons from sexual attacks.

 

                   Southin J.
approached the question of whether s. 7  was violated by making commendable
use of analogy to case law under s. 12  with respect to minimum sentences. 
She considered whether s. 179(1) (b) was grossly disproportionate to
its purpose, and whether it was necessary to achieve a valid criminal law
purpose.  In her opinion although the purpose of the section was valid, the
means were not proportional.  She found that the deprivation of liberty in
s. 179(1) (b) was not in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice because it is for life, and there is no avenue of review to
relieve those covered by the section in whole or in part from the disability. 
She was not satisfied that the s. 7  breach due to the lack of a review
process could be justified under s. 1 .

 

Constitutional Questions

 

                   On October 18, 1993
the Chief Justice stated the following constitutional questions:

 

1.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent to life, liberty and security of the person as
guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

3.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
according to law as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ?

 

4.If
the answer to question 3 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

5.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment as guaranteed by s. 12  of the Charter ?

 

6.If
the answer to question 5 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

7.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned
as guaranteed by s. 9  of the Charter ?

 

8.If
the answer to question 7 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

9.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent, if finally found guilty and punished for the
offence, not to be tried or punished for it again, as guaranteed by s. 11 (h)
of the Charter ?

 

10.If
the answer to question 9 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

Analysis

 

I.  Legislative
History of Section 179(1)(b)

 

                   A review of the
history of the vagrancy sections can be found in the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Munroe (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 217.  The offence
of vagrancy was codified in ss. 207 and 208 of the 1892 Criminal Code ,
although its history dates back to the Middle Ages in England:  See Ledwith
v. Roberts, [1937] 1 K.B. 232 (C.A.), at p. 271.  Section 207 of
the Criminal Code, S.C. 1892, c. 29, provided:

 

                   207.  Every one is a loose, idle
or disorderly person or vagrant who ‑‑

 

                   (a.)  not
having any visible means of maintaining himself lives without employment;

 

                   (b.)  being
able to work and thereby or by other means to maintain himself and family
wilfully refuses or neglects to do so;

 

                   (c.)  openly
exposes or exhibits in any street, road, highway or public place, any indecent
exhibition;

 

                   (d.)  without
a certificate signed, within six months, by a priest, clergyman or minister of
the Gospel, or two justices of the peace, residing in the municipality where
the alms are being asked, that he or she is a deserving object of charity,
wanders about and begs, or goes about from door to door, or places himself or
herself in any street, highway, passage or public place to beg or receive alms;

 

                   (e.)  loiters
on any street, road, highway or public place, and obstructs passengers by
standing across the footpath, or by using insulting language, or in any other
way;

 

                   (f.)  causes
a disturbance in or near any street, road, highway or public place, by screaming,
swearing or singing, or by being drunk, or by impeding or incommoding peaceable
passengers;

 

                   (g.)  by
discharging firearms, or by riotous or disorderly conduct in any street or
highway, wantonly disturbs the peace and quiet of the inmates of any dwelling‑house
near such street or highway;

 

                   (h.)  tears
down or defaces signs, breaks windows, or doors or door plates, or the walls of
houses, roads or gardens, or destroys fences;

 

                   (i.)  being
a common prostitute or night walker, wanders in the fields, public streets or
highways, lanes or places of public meeting or gathering of people, and does
not give a satisfactory account of herself;

 

                   (j.)  is
a keeper or inmate of a disorderly house, bawdy-house or house of ill‑fame,
or house for the resort of prostitutes;

 

                   (k.)  is
in the habit of frequenting such houses and does not give a satisfactory
account of himself or herself; or

 

                   (l.)  having
no peaceable profession or calling to maintain himself by, for the most part
supports himself by gaming or crime, or by the avails of prostitution.

 

Section 208 provided:

 

                   208.  Every loose, idle or
disorderly person or vagrant is liable, on summary conviction before two
justices of the peace, to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars or to
imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding six
months, or to both.

 

                   Historically, the
essence of the offence of vagrancy was that of being a loose, idle or
disorderly person or vagrant, rather than the doing of any of the
specific acts referred to in the vagrancy provisions.  The vagrancy provisions
remained virtually unchanged until the 1950s.  The predecessor to
s. 179(1)(b) was added to the vagrancy offences in S.C. 1951,
c. 47, s. 13.  This section provided that everyone is a loose, idle
or disorderly person or vagrant who:

 

                          238.  . . .

 

                   (k)  having
at any time been convicted of an offence under paragraph (a) of section
two hundred and ninety‑two, section two hundred and ninety‑three,
subsection one or two of section three hundred and one, or
section three hundred and two, is found loitering or wandering in or near a
school ground or playground or public park or public bathing area.

 

                   In the 1953‑54
Criminal Code  (S.C. 1953‑54, c. 51) the vagrancy provisions
were restructured so that the focus shifted from being a vagrant to doing the
acts prohibited by the section.  However, it is significant that the acts
prohibited were still primarily related to the status of the accused rather than
the nature of the acts themselves.  Section 164(1) of the 1953‑54 Code
provided:

 

164. (1)  Every one
commits vagrancy who

 

(a)not
having any apparent means of support is found wandering abroad or trespassing
and does not, when required, justify his presence in the place where he is
found;

 

(b)begs
from door to door or in a public place;

 

(c)being
a common prostitute or night walker is found in a public place and does not,
when required, give a good account of herself;

 

(d)supports
himself in whole or in part by gaming or crime and has no lawful profession or
calling by which to maintain himself; or

 

(e)having
at any time been convicted of an offence under a provision mentioned in
paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) of section 661, is found
loitering or wandering in or near a school ground, playground, public park or
bathing area.

 

Section 164(1)(e), which
eventually became the present s. 179(1)(b), has been amended since
that time to conform to changes in the numbering of the predicate offences in
the Code, and in the definitions of sexual offences in the Code. 
However, it has not changed in substance.

 

II.  How
Should the Word ""Loiter"" be Defined in Section 179(1)(b)?

 

                   The appellant
submits that the word ""loiter"" in s. 179(1)(b) should be
interpreted as requiring a malevolent intent while the respondent takes the
position that ""loiter"" should be given its ordinary meaning.

 

                   When a statutory
provision is to be interpreted the word or words in question should be
considered in the context in which they are used, and read in a manner which is
consistent with the purpose of the provision and the intention of the
legislature:  Elmer A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed.
1983), at p. 87; R. v. Hasselwander, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398. If the
ordinary meaning of the words is consistent with the context in which the words
are used and with the object of the act, then that is the interpretation which
should govern.

 

                   What then is the
ordinary meaning of the word ""loiter""?  The Oxford English
Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), defines ""loiter"" in this manner:

 

                   loiter . . .

 

                   1.  . . .  a.  In
early use:  To idle, waste one's time in idleness.  Now only with more specific
meaning:  To linger indolently on the way when sent on an errand or when making
a journey; to linger idly about a place; to waste time when engaged in some
particular task, to dawdle.  Freq. in legal phr. to loiter with intent
(to commit a felony).

 

Similarly, Black's Law Dictionary
(5th ed. 1979), defines ""loiter"" as follows:

 

To
be dilatory; to be slow in movement; to stand around or move slowly about; to
stand idly around; to spend time idly; to saunter; to delay; to idle; to
linger; to lag behind.

 

                   It is significant
that these definitions are essentially the same as those Constable German
provided to the respondent on June 16, 1989.  None of these definitions
requires a malevolent intent or makes any reference to such a requirement.

 

                   Cases which have
considered the meaning of ""loiter"" in other sections of the Code
support the use of the ordinary meaning of ""loiter"" in
s. 179(1)(b).  In R. v. Munroe, supra, the Ontario
Court of Appeal considered the meaning of ""loiter"" in what was then
s. 171(1) (c) of the Criminal Code  (now s. 175(1) (c)). 
That section makes it an offence to loiter in a public place and in any way
obstruct persons who are in that place.  The Ontario Court of Appeal gave
""loiter"" its ordinary dictionary meaning of ""hanging idly about
a place"".  It further held that if a person has some purpose for
""hanging idly about"" such as waiting for a spouse, then he or she
cannot be said to be idling.  The decision in Munroe was followed by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Gauvin (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 229, at
p. 232.

 

                   The same definition
of ""loiter"" has been applied to s. 177 of the Code.  That
section like its predecessor makes it an offence to loiter or prowl by night
near a dwelling house on the property of another person without a lawful
excuse.  In R. v. Andsten and Petrie (1960), 33 C.R. 213 (B.C.C.A.),
Davey J.A., writing for the court, held at p. 215 that ""`hanging
around' well expresses what is meant by `loiters' as used in s. 162 [now
s. 177]"".

 

                   In R. v.
Lozowchuk (1984), 32 Sask. R. 51 (Q.B.), Geatros J., after considering Munroe,
supra, and Andsten, supra, concluded at p. 54: 
""I find nothing in Code s. 173 to suggest that `loiter' is to
be construed other than in its ordinary and natural meaning"".  A similar
definition was endorsed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Cloutier (M.)
(1991), 51 Q.A.C. 143, 66 C.C.C. (3d) 149.  Chevalier J.A. writing for the
court held at p. 147 Q.A.C. and at pp. 154‑55 C.C.C.:

 

                   [translation]  I will also not
undertake to repeat here the definitions supported by dictionaries, given in
several judgments that I previously quoted, of the English terms
""loitering"" and ""prowling"".  Their French equivalents
""flâner"" and ""rôder"" reflect the same notions in respect of
the attitudes or acts involved.  Other than mere dictionary definitions, and as
confirmation of their correctness, the average person who hears these two words
immediately knows the difference.  And, for him, it is of great importance.

 

                   In
the loiterer, he sees an individual who is wandering about, apparently without
precise destination, who does not have, in his manner of moving, a purpose or
reason to do so other than to pass the time, who is not looking for anything
identifiable and who often is merely motivated by the whim of the moment.  The
dictionnaire des synonymes Bordas (1988), p. 424 gives the following as
synonyms for the verb ""to wander, stroll, to go for a jaunt, saunter, bum
about, dawdle, dillydally, hang about, and so on"".  In short, it is
conduct which essentially has nothing reprehensible about it if, as required by
s. 173, it does not take place on private property where, in principle, a
loiterer has no business.

 

See also R. v. Willis (1987),
37 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (B.C. Co. Ct.).

 

                   Thus, where it is
used in other sections of the Code, the word ""loiter"" has been
given its ordinary dictionary definition.

 

                   The United States
Supreme Court has also interpreted vagrancy statutes as not requiring proof of
any special intent or malevolence in order to convict.  In Papachristou v.
City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972), the court held that a municipal
vagrancy law was void for vagueness.  In discussing the application of the
vagrancy law, Douglas J., writing for the court, held that the law did not
require a specific intent to commit an unlawful act.  He wrote at p. 163:
""The Jacksonville ordinance makes criminal activities which by modern
standards are normally innocent"".

 

                   The ordinary
definition of ""loiter"" is also consistent with the purpose of
s. 179(1)(b).  The section is aimed at protecting children from
becoming victims of sexual offences.  This is apparent from the places to which
the prohibition of loitering applies.  School grounds, playgrounds, public
parks and public bathing areas are typically places where children are likely
to congregate.  The purpose of the prohibition on loitering is to keep people
who are likely to pose a risk to children away from places where they are
likely to be found.  Prohibiting any prolonged attendance in these areas, which
is what the ordinary definition of ""loiter"" does, achieves this goal.

 

                   Furthermore, the
concept of malevolent intent favoured by the appellant (as opposed to a
narrower formula such as unlawful intent, which the appellant does not endorse)
raises problems of definition which make it unworkable.  The Oxford English
Dictionary defines ""malevolent"" as a person
"". . .  Desirous of evil to others; entertaining, actuated by,
or indicative of ill‑will; disposed or addicted to ill‑will"". 
These definitions make it apparent that it is a concept of very broad scope
that is extremely difficult to define.  Malevolent intent could mean almost
anything, and its definition would be dependent upon the subjective views of
the particular judge trying the case.

 

                   The appellant and
the Attorney General of Canada argue that the legislative debates surrounding
the passage of the section in 1951, and again when it was reconsidered in 1986‑87
provide support for the proposition that ""loiter"" in s. 179(1)(b)
includes the notion of some sort of malevolent intent.  In my opinion this
argument is not well founded.  The admissibility of legislative debates to
determine legislative intent in statutory construction is doubtful:  Drieger, supra,
at pp. 156‑58; Pierre‑André Côté, The Interpretation of
Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1992), at pp. 353‑67.  This
Court has repeatedly held that legislative history is not admissible as proof
of legislative intent in the construction of statutes:  Gosselin v. The King
(1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, at pp. 264‑68, per Taschereau C.J.; Attorney
General of Canada v. The Reader's Digest Association (Canada) Ltd., [1961]
S.C.R. 775; R. v. Popovic and Askov, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 308, at
p. 318; Highway Victims Indemnity Fund v. Gagné, [1977] 1 S.C.R.
785, at p. 792.

 

                   It is apparent that
legislative history may be admissible for the more general purpose of showing the
mischief Parliament was attempting to remedy with the legislation:  Toronto
Railway Co. v. The Queen (1894), 4 Ex. C.R. 262, at pp. 270‑71; Lyons
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, at pp. 683‑84.  Additionally,
more flexible rules apply in the admission of legislative history in
constitutional cases.  In those cases the legislative history will not be used
to interpret the enactments themselves, but to appreciate their constitutional
validity: Reference re Anti‑Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373; Re
Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714; Schneider v. The
Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 112; Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights
Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297; Bell Canada v. Quebec (Commission de
la santé et de la sécurité du travail), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 749; R. v.
Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713; PSAC v. Canada,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 424; and R. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.  Legislative
history is also admissible in Charter  cases to help interpret its
provisions:  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at
pp. 506‑9.

 

                   Nonetheless there
are persuasive reasons advanced which support the position that legislative
history or debates are inadmissible as proof of legislative intent in statutory
construction.  Many of these same reasons are also put forward to demonstrate
that such materials should be given little weight even in those cases where
they are admitted.  The main problem with the use of legislative history is its
reliability.  First, the intent of particular members of Parliament is not the
same as the intent of the Parliament as a whole.  Thus, it may be said that the
corporate will of the legislature is only found in the text of provisions which
are passed into law.  Second, the political nature of Parliamentary debates
brings into question the reliability of the statements made.  Different members
of the legislature may have different purposes in putting forward their
positions.  That is to say the statements of a member made in the heat of
debate or in committee hearings may not reflect even that member's position at
the time of the final vote on the legislation.

 

                   Despite the
apparent merits of the rule that legislative history is inadmissible to
determine legislative intent in statutory construction, this Court has on
occasion made use of such materials for this very purpose:  see R. v. Vasil,
[1981] 1 S.C.R. 469, at p. 487, and Paul v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 621.

 

                   However, it is not
necessary in this case to determine the admissibility of the debates for the
purpose of determining legislative intent.  The debates concerning
s. 179(1)(b) are inconclusive with regard to the meaning of
loitering.  In both the 1951 debates (Hansard, June 25, 1951 at pp. 4664‑66)
and the 1986‑87 debates (Legislative Committee Minutes, November 27, 1986
at p. 1:46; December 11, 1986 at pp. 3:24‑3:25; December 18,
1986 at pp. 6:18‑6:19; February 5, 1987 at pp. 8:29‑8:30;
February 17, 1987 at pp. 9:70‑9:75; March 17, 1987 at pp. 10:27‑10:31)
different members of Parliament applied different meanings to the word
""loiter"".  Some used it to mean simply ""hanging around"",
while others attached to it the connotation of lurking or the concept of not
being able to give a good account of oneself.  Thus, even if the debates were
held to be admissible, they are of no assistance in determining the meaning
that Parliament intended to be given to the word ""loiter"" in
s. 179(1)(b).

 

                   Thus, the word
""loiter"" in s. 179(1)(b) should be given its ordinary
meaning, namely to stand idly around, hang around, linger, tarry, saunter,
delay, dawdle, etc.  This is consistent with the meaning given to the word as
used elsewhere in the Code, and with the context and purpose of
s. 179(1)(b).

 

III.  Section 7
of the Charter

 

                   There can be no
question that s. 179(1)(b) restricts the liberty of those to whom
it applies.  Indeed, the appellant made no argument to the contrary.  The
section prohibits convicted sex offenders from attending (except perhaps to
quickly walk through on their way to another location) at school grounds,
playgrounds, public parks or bathing areas ‑‑ places where the rest
of the public is free to roam.  The breach of this prohibition is punishable on
summary conviction and, as this case demonstrates, imprisonment is the
consequence.

 

                   The question this
Court must decide is whether this restriction on liberty is in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice.  The respondent conceded in oral
argument that a prohibition for the purpose of protecting the public does not per
se infringe the principles of fundamental justice.  R. v. Lyons,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 327‑34, held that the indeterminate
detention of a dangerous offender, the purpose of which was the protection of
the public, did not per se violate s. 7.  In light of that decision
this concession was appropriate.  If indeterminate detention in order to
protect the public does not per se violate s. 7, then it follows
the imposition of a lesser limit on liberty for the same purpose will not in
itself constitute a violation of s. 7.  The question, then, is whether
some other aspect of the prohibition contained in s. 179(1)(b)
violates the principles of fundamental justice.  In my opinion it does.  It
applies without prior notice to the accused, to too many places, to too many
people, for an indefinite period with no possibility of review.  It restricts
liberty far more than is necessary to accomplish its goal.

 

A.  Overbreadth

 

                   This Court
considered the issue of overbreadth as a principle of fundamental justice in R.
v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606.  Writing for
the Court, Gonthier J. discussed the relationship between overbreadth and
vagueness at pp. 627‑31.  After looking at the notion of overbreadth
in American constitutional law, he wrote at pp. 629‑31:

 

                   This
Court has repeatedly emphasized the numerous differences which exist between
the Charter  and the American Constitution.  In particular, in the
interpretation of s. 2  of the Charter , this Court has taken a route
completely different from that of U.S. courts.  In cases starting with Irwin
Toy up to Butler, including the Prostitution Reference and Keegstra,
this Court has given a wide ambit to the freedoms guaranteed by s. 2  of
the Charter , on the basis that balancing between the objectives of the
State and the violation of a right or freedom should occur at the s. 1 
stage.  Other sections of the Charter , such as ss. 7  and 8 , do
however incorporate some element of balancing, as a limitation within the
definition of the protected right, with respect to other notions such as
principles of fundamental justice or reasonableness.

 

                   A
notion tied to balancing such as overbreadth finds its proper place in sections
of the Charter  which involve a balancing process.  Consequently, I
cannot but agree with the opinion expressed by L'Heureux‑Dubé J. in Committee
for the Commonwealth of Canada that overbreadth is subsumed under the
""minimal impairment branch"" of the Oakes test, under s. 1 
of the Charter .  This is also in accordance with the trend evidenced in Osborne
and Butler.  Furthermore, in determining whether s. 12  of the Charter 
has been infringed, for instance, a court if it finds the punishment not
grossly disproportionate for the accused, will typically examine reasonable hypotheses
and assess whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate in these
situations (R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, and R. v. Goltz,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 485).  This inquiry also resembles the sort of balancing
process associated with the notion of overbreadth.

 

                   In
all these cases, however, overbreadth remains no more than an analytical tool. 
The alleged overbreadth is always related to some limitation under the Charter . 
It is always established by comparing the ambit of the provision touching upon
a protected right with such concepts as the objectives of the State, the
principles of fundamental justice, the proportionality of punishment or the
reasonableness of searches and seizures, to name a few.  There is no such thing
as overbreadth in the abstract.  Overbreadth has no autonomous value under the Charter . 
As will be seen below, overbreadth is not at the heart of this case, although
it has been invoked in argument.

 

                   The
relationship between vagueness and ""overbreadth"" was well expounded
by the Ontario Court of Appeal in this oft‑quoted passage from R. v.
Zundel (1987), 58 O.R. (2d) 129, at pp. 157‑58:

 

Vagueness
and overbreadth are two concepts.  They can be applied separately, or they may
be closely interrelated.  The intended effect of a statute may be perfectly
clear and thus not vague, and yet its application may be overly broad. 
Alternatively, as an example of the two concepts being closely interrelated,
the wording of a statute may be so vague that its effect is considered to be
overbroad.

 

I
agree.  A vague law may also constitute an excessive impairment of Charter 
rights under the Oakes test.  This Court recognized this, when it
mentioned the two aspects of vagueness under s. 1  of the Charter ,
in Osborne and Butler.

 

                   For
the sake of clarity, I would prefer to reserve the term ""vagueness""
for the most serious degree of vagueness, where a law is so vague as not to
constitute a ""limit prescribed by law"" under s. 1  in limine. 
The other aspect of vagueness, being an instance of overbreadth, should be
considered as such.

 

                   Overbreadth and
vagueness are different concepts, but are sometimes related in particular
cases.  As the Ontario Court of Appeal observed in R. v. Zundel (1987),
58 O.R. (2d) 129, at pp. 157‑58, cited with approval by
Gonthier J. in R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra,
the meaning of a law may be unambiguous and thus the law will not be vague;
however, it may still be overly broad.  Where a law is vague, it may also be
overly broad, to the extent that the ambit of its application is difficult to
define.  Overbreadth and vagueness are related in that both are the result of a
lack of sufficient precision by a legislature in the means used to accomplish
an objective.  In the case of vagueness, the means are not clearly defined.  In
the case of overbreadth the means are too sweeping in relation to the objective.

 

                   Overbreadth
analysis looks at the means chosen by the state in relation to its purpose.  In
considering whether a legislative provision is overbroad, a court must ask the
question:  are those means necessary to achieve the State objective?  If the State,
in pursuing a legitimate objective, uses means which are broader than is
necessary to accomplish that objective, the principles of fundamental justice
will be violated because the individual's rights will have been limited for no
reason.  The effect of overbreadth is that in some applications the law is
arbitrary or disproportionate.

 

                   Reviewing
legislation for overbreadth as a principle of fundamental justice is simply an
example of the balancing of the State interest against that of the individual.  This
type of balancing has been approved by this Court:  see Rodriguez v. British
Columbia (Attorney General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, per Sopinka J., at
pp. 592‑95; R. v. Jones, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284, per La
Forest J., at p. 298; R. v. Lyons, supra, per La Forest
J., at pp. 327‑29; R. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at
pp. 402‑3; Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of
Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 538‑39; and Cunningham v. Canada, [1993]
2 S.C.R. 143, at pp. 151‑53.  However, where an independent
principle of fundamental justice is violated, such as the requirement of mens
rea for penal liability, or of the right to natural justice, any balancing
of the public interest must take place under s. 1  of the Charter :  Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at p. 517; R. v. Swain,
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 977.

 

                   In analyzing a
statutory provision to determine if it is overbroad, a measure of deference
must be paid to the means selected by the legislature.  While the courts have a
constitutional duty to ensure that legislation conforms with the Charter ,
legislatures must have the power to make policy choices.  A court should not
interfere with legislation merely because a judge might have chosen a different
means of accomplishing the objective if he or she had been the legislator.  It
is true that s. 7  of the Charter  has a wide scope.  This was
stressed by Lamer J. (as he then was) in Re B.C. Motor Vehicles Act, supra,
at p. 502.  There he observed:

 

                   Sections
8 to 14 are illustrative of deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and
security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   However, before it
can be found that an enactment is so broad that it infringes s. 7  of the Charter ,
it must be clear that the legislation infringes life, liberty or security of
the person in a manner that is unnecessarily broad, going beyond what is needed
to accomplish the governmental objective.

 

                   The purpose of
s. 179(1)(b) is to protect children from becoming victims of sexual
offences.  This is apparent from the prohibition which applies to places where
children are very likely to be found.  In determining whether s. 179(1)(b)
is overly broad and not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice, it must be determined whether the means chosen to accomplish this
objective are reasonably tailored to effect this purpose.  In those situations
where legislation limits the liberty of an individual in order to protect the
public, that limitation should not go beyond what is necessary to accomplish
that goal.  In Cunningham v. Canada, supra, at p. 153, McLachlin
J. held that changes to the Parole Act which adversely affected the
liberty of prisoners were in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice because ""the prisoner's liberty interest is limited only to the
extent that this is shown to be necessary for the protection of the
public"".

 

                   In my opinion,
s. 179(1)(b) suffers from overbreadth and thus the deprivation of
liberty it entails is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

                   i.  Overbreadth
in Geographical Ambit

 

                   The section is
overly broad in its geographical ambit.  It applies not only to school grounds
and playgrounds, but also to all public parks and bathing areas.  Its
application to schools and playgrounds is appropriate, as these are the very
places children are likely to congregate.  But its application to all public
parks and bathing areas is overly broad because not all such places are places
where children are likely to be found.  Public parks include the vast and
remote wilderness parks.  Bathing areas would include all the lakes in Canada
with public beaches.  Prohibiting individuals from loitering in all places in
all parks is a significant limit on freedom of movement.  Parks are places
which are specifically designed to foster relaxation, indolent contemplation
and strolling; in fact it may be assumed that ""hanging around"" and
""idling"" is encouraged in parks.  The overly broad scope of this
section was remarked upon by Maughan B.C. Prov. Ct. J. in R. v. Graf
(1988), 42 C.R.R. 146, in which she found that what was at the time s. 175
(now s. 179(1)(b)) of the Criminal Code  violated the Charter . 
She wrote at p. 150:

 

                   The
wording of s. 175 makes a person such as Mr. Graf, the accused, a person
in a permanent state of exile within his community who is, because of his
status, absolutely prohibited from standing idly in vast areas of this
country.  Mr. Graf, because of his status, does not have the liberty of
movement and locomotion to go where other citizens are entitled to go and in
the same manner as they are entitled to do.  He is, for example, banned for
life from standing idly about Stanley Park, including the aquarium and the zoo
area, Lost Lagoon, the playing fields, the beaches and the entertainment area. 
Similarly are included Queen Elizabeth Park, English Bay, the Planetarium,
Vanier Park, the endowment lands at the University of British Columbia, the
Courthouse gardens, Jericho Beach, Spanish Banks, Kitsilano Park, the Sky Train
greenbelt, the multitude of small city parks, Manning Park, the marine parks in
the province, waterfront parks, Cleveland Dam, Capilano Hatchery, Mount Seymour
ski area, Lynn Valley Park, Lynn Canyon Park and all beaches, lake and rivers
in Canada capable of being used by people for bathing.

 

                   If the particular
park or part of the park or bathing area is not a place frequented by children,
the object of protecting children is not enhanced by limiting the individual's
freedom.  In my opinion, such a limit should be more narrowly defined, to apply
only to those parks and bathing areas where children can reasonably be expected
to be present.

 

                   ii.Overbreadth by the Life‑Time
Prohibition Without a Review Process

 

                   Section 179(1)(b)
is also overly broad in another aspect.  It applies for life, with no
possibility of review.  The absence of review means that a person who has
ceased to be a danger to children (or who indeed never was a danger to
children), is subject to the prohibition in s. 179(1)(b).  In R.
v. Lyons, supra, La Forest J., writing for the Court on this
issue, held that the fact that a review process existed was essential to the
finding that indeterminate sentences under the dangerous offender provisions
did not violate s. 12 .  La Forest J. wrote at p. 341:

 

                   In
my opinion, if the sentence imposed under Part XXI was indeterminate, simpliciter,
it would be certain, at least occasionally, to result in sentences grossly
disproportionate to what individual offenders deserved.  However, I believe
that the parole process saves the legislation from being successfully challenged
under s. 12 , for it ensures that incarceration is imposed for only as long
as the circumstances of the individual case require.

 

                   Thus the imposition
of an indeterminate sentence upon dangerous offenders in the absence of a
review procedure would constitute a cruel and unusual punishment and violate
the principles of fundamental justice.  It follows that there must be some
review available for the prohibition in s. 179(1)(b) if it is to
accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  Admittedly, the prohibition
in s. 179(1)(b) is a lesser infringement of liberty than the
indeterminate detention of a dangerous offender.  Yet, it is still a very
significant limit on an individual's freedom of movement.  Attendance at the
places listed in s. 179(1)(b) has not as a rule been regulated in
Canada, and still is not regulated for the general public who have not
committed sex offences.  In passing I would observe that a different conclusion
regarding the need for a review might have been reached if the prohibition was
in respect of a regulated activity such as driving or the possession of
firearms.

 

                   The appellant and
the Attorney General of Canada argued that the availability of a pardon under
the Criminal Records Act , as amended, or the royal prerogative of mercy,
meet any concerns about the need for review.  In my opinion they do not.  It is
true that a pardon or the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy would
(subject to any conditions) vacate the conviction and remove the
disqualification that resulted from the conviction:  s. 5 (b) of the
Criminal Records Act ; s. 749(3) of the Code; Clayton C.
Ruby, Sentencing (3rd ed. 1987), at pp. 108‑9.  However,
there are limits to the availability of pardons which make it inadequate and
insufficient as a substitute for the review of the prohibition in
s. 179(1) (b).  For example, the conditions for granting pardons are
not necessarily related to the dangerousness of the individual.  A person who
is not a danger to children may be denied a pardon.  Under the Criminal
Records Act , an individual may not apply for a pardon until five years
after the completion of sentence in the case of an indictable offence, and three
years after the completion of sentence in the case of a summary conviction
offence: see s. 4  of the Criminal Records Act .  As the prohibition
applies to all persons convicted of the listed offences, there are individuals
who will not be dangerous yet will, during the time they cannot apply for a
pardon, still be subject to s. 179(1) (b).

 

                   A more serious
problem is presented by the conditions which must be met in order to obtain a
pardon.  A person convicted of an indictable offence may only obtain a pardon
if he has been ""of good behaviour"", and has not been convicted of an
offence under federal legislation:  s. 4.1(1)  of the Criminal Records
Act .  A sex offender who has not committed any further sexual offences, and
is not considered a danger to re‑offend, would not be eligible for a
pardon if he was considered not to have been of good behaviour in a manner
completely unrelated to sexual offences.  Even if the conditions are met, in
the case of indictable offences a pardon is still discretionary.  In the case
of a person convicted of a summary conviction offence, a pardon is mandatory if
the person has not been convicted of any offence under federal legislation: 
s. 4.1(2)  of the Criminal Records Act .  However, a person who was
no longer a danger, but who had committed an unrelated driving offence would
not be eligible for a pardon.  With respect to the royal prerogative of mercy,
its use is exceptional:  National Parole Board, Pardon Decision Policies,
Annex:  The Royal Prerogative of Mercy (June 1993).  Neither the
availability of a pardon nor the royal prerogative of mercy can constitute an
acceptable review process.

 

                   iii.Overbreadth as to the
People to Whom Section 179(1)(b) Applies

 

                   Section 179(1)(b)
is overly broad in respect to the people to whom it applies.  It applies to all
persons convicted of the listed offences, without regard to whether they
constitute a danger to children.  This approach is contrary to the position
taken by this Court in earlier decisions.  In R. v. Swain, supra,
the detention of all persons found not guilty by reason of insanity was found
to be arbitrary because it was based on the overly inclusive assumption that
all such persons were still dangerous at the time of sentencing:  see
pp. 1009, 1011‑13.  Similarly, in R. v. Lyons, supra,
the necessity of showing that an individual was likely to be a danger in the future
was one of the features which saved the legislation from violating s. 12 
of the Charter  (at p. 338).  It is difficult to accept that a
person who had sexually assaulted an adult fifteen years earlier with no
subsequent offences should be assumed to still be a threat to children.

 

                   This Court has
approved the use of reasonable hypotheses in determining whether legislation
violates s. 12  of the Charter :  R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
1045; R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485.  I think the same process may properly
be undertaken in determining the constitutionality of s. 179(1) (b). 
The effect of the section is that it could be applied to a man convicted at age
18 of sexual assault of an adult woman who was known to him in a situation
aggravated by his consumption of alcohol.  Even if that man never committed
another offence, and was not considered to be a danger to children, at the age
of 65 he would still be banned from attending, for all but the shortest length
of time, a public park anywhere in Canada.  The limitation on liberty in
s. 179(1) (b) is simply much broader than is necessary to accomplish
its laudable objective of protecting children from becoming victims of sexual
offences.

 

                   A new s. 161 
was passed following the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
this case and is set out later in these reasons.  It is significant and telling
that the new section only applies to persons who have committed the listed
offences in respect of a person who is under the age of 14 years.  In addition,
under the new section, the order is discretionary, so that only those offenders
who constitute a danger to children will be subject to a prohibition.  I would
add that in certain circumstances, legislative provisions for notice and for
review of the prohibition may reduce the significance of the factor of
overbreadth in the application of one impugned provision.  It is noteworthy
that the new s. 161  provides for both notice and review of the
prohibition.  These provisions are absent in s. 179(1)(b).

 

                   iv.  Absence
of Notice

 

                   There is another
aspect in which the section offends the principles of fundamental justice.  As
Hutcheon J.A. observed, there is no provision for notice to be given to a
person convicted of a predicate offence of his potential liability for
breaching s. 179(1)(b).  As he points out, great care is taken to
give notice in connection with other provisions of the Code.  For
example, the prohibition against ownership, custody or control of a firearm
under s. 100  must be made part of the sentencing proceeding following a
conviction for the indictable offence involving violence.  Notice must also be
given of the prohibition of operating a motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft
pursuant to s. 260.  Similarly notice must be given of the terms of a
probation order.  The lack of a notice requirement for s. 179(1)(b)
is unfair and unnecessarily so.  It demonstrates that the section by the
absence of a requirement of notice violates s. 7 .

 

                   In summary,
s. 179(1)(b) is overly broad to an extent that it violates the
right to liberty proclaimed by s. 7  of the Charter  for a number of
reasons.  First, it is overly broad in its geographical scope embracing as it
does all public parks and beaches no matter how remote and devoid of children
they may be.  Secondly, it is overly broad in its temporal aspect with the
prohibition applying for life without any process for review.  Thirdly, it is
too broad in the number of persons it encompasses.  Fourth, the prohibitions
are put in place and may be enforced without any notice to the accused.

 

                   I am strengthened
in this conclusion by a consideration of the new s. 161 of the Criminal
Code, S.C. 1993, c. 45, s. 1, which was enacted shortly after the
decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.  The section
provides:

 

                   161. (1)  Where an offender
is convicted, or is discharged on the conditions prescribed in a probation
order under section 736, of an offence under section 151, 152, 155 or 159,
subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 271, 272 or 273, in respect of a
person who is under the age of fourteen years, the court that sentences the
offender or directs that the accused be discharged, as the case may be, in
addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence or any
other condition prescribed in the order of discharge, shall consider making and
may make, subject to the conditions or exemptions that the court directs, an
order prohibiting the offender from

 

(a)  attending
a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of fourteen
years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare
centre, schoolground, playground or community centre; or

 

(b)  seeking,
obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is
remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves
being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of
fourteen years.

 

                   (2)  The
prohibition may be for life or for any shorter duration that the court
considers desirable and, in the case of a prohibition that is not for life, the
prohibition begins on the later of

 

(a)  the
date on which the order is made; and

 

(b)  where
the offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the date on which the
offender is released from imprisonment for the offence, including release on
parole, mandatory supervision or statutory release.

 

                   (3)  A
court that makes an order of prohibition or, where the court is for any reason
unable to act, another court of equivalent jurisdiction in the same province,
may, on application of the offender or the prosecutor, require the offender to
appear before it at any time and, after hearing the parties, that court may
vary the conditions prescribed in the order if, in the opinion of the court,
the variation is desirable because of changed circumstances after the
conditions were prescribed.

 

                   (4)  Every
person who is bound by an order of prohibition and who does not comply with the
order is guilty of

 

(a)  an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years; or

 

(b)  an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   It can be seen that
this section is limited to clearly defined geographical areas where children
are or can reasonably be expected to be present.  Further, the prohibition may
be for life or a shorter period and a system of review is provided. 
Additionally, the order of prohibition is made part of the sentencing procedure
so that the accused is aware of and notified of the prohibitions.  It is thus
apparent that overly broad provisions are not essential or necessary in order
to achieve the aim of s. 179(1)(b).

 

                   The violation of
s. 7  of the Charter  is thus established.  It is now necessary to
consider whether the section may be saved by the provisions of s. 1  of the
Charter .

 

IV.  Section 1
of the Charter

 

                   This Court has
expressed doubt about whether a violation of the right to life, liberty or
security of the person which is not in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice can ever be justified, except perhaps in times of war or
national emergencies:  Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, supra, at
p. 518.  In a case where the violation of the principles of fundamental
justice is as a result of overbreadth, it is even more difficult to see how the
limit can be justified.  Overbroad legislation which infringes s. 7  of the
Charter  would appear to be incapable of passing the minimal impairment
branch of the s. 1  analysis.

 

                   The objective of
s. 179(1)(b) is certainly pressing and substantial.  The protection
of children from sexual offences is obviously very important to society. 
Furthermore, at least in some of their applications, the means employed in
s. 179(1)(b) are rationally connected to the objective.  However,
for the same reasons that s. 179(1)(b) is overly broad, it fails
the minimal impairment branch of the s. 1  analysis.  The new s. 161
is a good example of legislation which is much more carefully and narrowly
fashioned to achieve the same objective as s. 179(1)(b). 
Section 179(1)(b) cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

V.  Remedy

 

                   Counsel for the
appellant argued that even if s. 179(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 
is so overbroad as to result in a violation of s. 7  which cannot be saved
by s. 1 , rather than striking the section down in its entirety, the
section should be read down so as to come within constitutional limits.  In my
opinion reading down is not appropriate in this case.  The changes which would
be required to make s. 179(1) (b) constitutional would not
constitute reading down or reading in; rather, they would amount to judicial
rewriting of the legislation.

 

                   This Court
considered the application of flexible remedial alternatives under s. 52 
of the Constitution Act, 1982  such as reading in and reading down in Schachter
v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679.  Lamer C.J., writing for himself and four
other members of the Court, held that reading in or reading down will only be
warranted where:  (i)  the legislative objective is obvious, and
reading in or reading down would constitute a lesser intrusion on that
objective than striking down the legislation; (ii)  the choice of
means used by the legislature is not so unequivocal that reading in or reading
down would unacceptably intrude into the legislative sphere; and
(iii)  reading in or reading down would not impact on budgetary
decisions to such an extent that it would change the nature of the legislation
at issue.

 

                   Reading in or
reading down in this case would create an entirely new scheme.  Parliament
chose unequivocal means in s. 179(1) (b), namely, a prohibition on
loitering for all persons convicted of the listed offences in all
school grounds, playgrounds, public parks and bathing areas, for life, with
no possibility of review.  The changes required to make the section comply
with s. 7  of the Charter  would constitute a completely different
approach to the problem, and would amount to an unwarranted intrusion into the
legislative domain.  Any changes required to be made over and above the
provisions of the new s. 161  should be made by Parliament.

 

Disposition

 

                   The
constitutional questions are, therefore, answered as follows:

 

1.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
limit the right of the respondent to life, liberty and security of the person
as guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

A.                Yes.

 

2.If
the answer to question 1 is yes, is the limitation one which is reasonable,
prescribed by law and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

A.                No.

 

In view of the answers to the first
two constitutional questions, it is unnecessary to answer the other
constitutional questions.  The appeal is dismissed.

 

                   The reasons of La
Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Gonthier
J. -- I have read the
opinion of Justice Cory and, with all due respect, find I am unable to agree. 
The central issue in this case concerns the interpretation of s. 179(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  By giving the word
""loiter"" its ordinary meaning, Cory J. would interpret the provision
as prohibiting lingering, tarrying, standing idly around, sauntering, delaying,
dawdling, etc. in the enumerated areas.  This interpretation leads him to
conclude that the prohibition created by s. 179(1) (b) violates
s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is not
saved by s. 1  because it is overbroad in terms of the persons, places and
time period to which it applies and because notice to the accused is not
required.  In my view, however, s. 179(1) (b) should be interpreted
as prohibiting the persons affected from being in one of the enumerated places
for a malevolent or ulterior purpose related to the predicate offences.  My
reasons for favouring this interpretation are drawn from the purpose and
legislative history of s. 179(1) (b) as well as precedent and
statutory context.  The first two parts of my reasons are devoted to these
points.  In the third part, I examine the constitutionality of this
interpretation.

 

A.  The legislative
history and purpose of s. 179(1) (b) of the Criminal Code 

 

                   Section 179(1) (b)
makes it an offence for persons who have been convicted of certain enumerated
offences to loiter ""in or near a school ground, playground, public park or
bathing area"".  The enumerated offences are:

 

. 
sexual interference, sexual touching or sexual exploitation of a person under
14 (ss. 151, 152 and 153 respectively);

 

. 
bestiality in the presence of a person under 14 (s. 160(3));

 

. 
sexual exposure to a person under 14 (s. 173(2));

 

. 
the sexual assault provisions (ss. 271, 272, 273); and

 

. 
the ""serious personal injury offences"" identified in s. 687  as
it read before January 4, 1983 (rape, attempted rape, sexual
intercourse with a female under fourteen or between fourteen and sixteen,
indecent assault on a female or male and gross indecency).

 

Clearly a wide range of offenders are
affected, in part because of the inclusion of the general sexual assault
provisions and their antecedents.  The central interpretive question relates to
the scope of the prohibition.  Guidance in answering this question can be taken
from an examination of the legislative history of the section and an analysis
of its purpose.

 

                   Though the
prohibition of ""vagrancy"" in the common law world dates from at least
the fourteenth century, s. 179(1)(b) of the Code was only
added in 1951 (S.C. 1951, c. 47, s. 13).  Excerpts from the
parliamentary debates prior to the adoption of the offence aid in identifying
the mischief which the offence was aimed at and its intended scope:

 

Mr.
Garson:  ...  The British Columbia section of the Canadian Bar Association made
the suggestion.  I think they were actuated in making it by several rather
nasty cases that had arisen in which, as my hon. friend knows is often the
case, children were the victims of these sex perverts.  They thought that by
keeping them away from the places indicated in this section the purpose they
had in mind might be served.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Mr.
Fleming:  ...  If a man is listening to a band concert and behaves himself I do
not think anyone will say he is loitering or wandering about.  It seems to me a
very sound idea that people with records like that who are found in these
public areas loitering or wandering about should be liable to conviction on a
charge of vagrancy.  It is not any more serious than that, but I am sure it
will give more effective opportunity to keep such people moving out of such
places.

 

(House
of Commons Debates, June 25, 1951, at pp. 4664 and 4666.)

 

These two passages demonstrate an
intention to keep sex offenders away from places frequented by children, but
not to prohibit them totally from the enumerated areas.  As with legislative
debates generally, the above passages are not determinative.  They are,
however, properly part of the evidence which a court may consider to identify
the purpose of a statutory provision (see R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.,
[1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at pp. 744-45, per Dickson C.J. for the
majority).

 

                   Turning to the
legislative history of s. 179(1) (b), it should be noted that the original
provision enacted in 1951 prohibited persons convicted of the enumerated
offences from loitering or wandering in the same areas now listed in
s. 179(1) (b).  In 1985, after the reports of the Badgley and Fraser
Commissions, the provision was kept, but amended to remove the word
""wander"".  This specific deletion would indicate that the word
""loiter"" was considered by Parliament to have a different meaning
from ""wander"".  Indeed, the word ""wander"" is somewhat broader
than ""loiter"".  ""Wander"" merely connotes movement without
specific destination; ""loiter"" has a variable connotation according
to the context, though these connotations share the common element of
idleness.  The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), defines
""wander"" in the following general terms:

 

wander
...

 

                   1.a.  ... To move hither and thither
without fixed course or certain aim; to be (in motion) without control or
direction; to roam, ramble, go idly or restlessly about; to have no fixed abode
or station.  

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   e.  To go or take one's way casually or
without predetermined route; to go to a place by a devious and leisurely
course; to stroll, saunter.

 

The word ""loiter"", by
contrast, is defined more narrowly:

 

loiter
... 

 

                   1.  ... a. In early use:  To
idle, waste one's time in idleness.  Now only with more specific meaning:  To
linger indolently on the way when sent on an errand or when making a journey;
to linger idly about a place; to waste time when engaged in some particular
task, to dawdle.  Freq. in legal phr. to loiter with intent (to commit a
felony).

 

                   Other evidence
before the trial judge which is of assistance in understanding the purpose and
scope of s. 179(1) (b) is the testimony of the psychiatric and
psychological experts called on behalf of the Crown.  Filmer Prov. Ct. J.
summarized a crucial portion of this evidence in the following terms:

 

...
the root cause of sexual offending is difficult to diagnose and treat.  It
involves a mechanism wherein sexual stimulation is found and relieved in
various ways but usually in a fairly predictable cycle.  The cycle involves an
increasing need to be stimulated and is usually marked by an ever-increasing
need to be near the object of arousal.  To treat this drive, the subject must
be disassociated from the objects, such as children, which may arouse.  This
separation is paramount in treatment.  In many cases treatment is a lifelong
endeavour.

 

A portion of the evidence of
Dr. Semrau, a psychiatrist, more fully explains some of these points:

 

...
one does not speak of curing sexual offenders and ‑- and particularly so
of pedophiles.  The ‑- one can hope to bring their offending tendency
under some degree of control, but treatment has to involve a very long-term
relapse prevention sort of component and so this kind of restriction is ‑-
is a critical part of that because perhaps an analogy could be made with that
of an alcoholic, [the example was of an alcoholic going into a bar thinking it
would not kill him.  Such a person, however, is at perpetual risk of slipping
into alcoholism again] but the same sort of analogy can be made that once one
has engaged in some such behaviour it ‑- it starts you on a slippery
slope towards reoffending.

 

                   So
that sort of provision in the Criminal Code  is entirely compatible with, and in
keeping with, and supportive of, the basic principles of treatment of sexual
offenders.

 

The psychiatrist stated that offenders
will often believe that their conduct is perfectly lawful; however, in reality
they will be ""on a slippery slope towards reoffending"".  He stressed
that it is an important part of treatment to help offenders to recognize that
such conduct, though normally lawful for everyone else, is not benign in their
case but rather is part of the cycle of re-offending.

 

                   In addition to the
possibility that the risk of re-offending may be perpetual and that
disassociation aids treatment, there was also considerable evidence before the
trial judge on the issue of crossover.  Crossover refers to the situation where
a sexual offender commits a different type of offence when she/he re-offends. 
An example of such crossover would be where a person convicted of a sexual
assault against an adult later molests a child.  Both Dr. Semrau and
Dr. Glackman made reference to the work of Dr. Abel.  Dr. Abel
was described as one of ""half a dozen top experts in the world in the area
of sexual offenders"".  Contrary to conventional wisdom, Dr. Abel
discovered that there is extensive cross-offending so that a given offender is
likely to be involved in a variety of different activities throughout a
lifetime.  Dr. Semrau summarized the implications of this research in the
following terms:  ""So that there is ‑- there's, in fact, a large
crossover from one category to another.  A sexual offender convicted of a
particular offence must be viewed also, in general, as having a substantial
risk for all of the other kinds of sexual offences as well"".  The current
state of knowledge therefore suggests that a person who demonstrates one form
of sexually deviant behaviour may present a more general risk.

 

                   It is hard to deny
that there will be individual cases where the risk of crossover or the risk of
re-offending will not be present, but as both Dr. Semrau and
Dr. Glackman stressed it is impossible, given the current state of
knowledge, to identify such persons with any certainty.  Dr. Semrau
explained the problem in this way:

 

                   Again,
for some individuals it may not be important, but given our lack of ability to
get people to be honest with us or, indeed, we have no ‑‑ we have
some psychological and psychiatric testing and assessment methods which give us
some clues to what an individual's tendencies are but it's very easy, given our
current methods, for offenders to grossly mislead us with regard to what their
tendencies are.  Anyone who's worked in this area has had many painful
experiences of finding that ‑- that, despite perhaps a lot of experience,
that they are ‑- that they were woefully naive in believing people, and
so we don't have the ability to separate out which, let's say adult female
rapists, are going to be at risk for molesting children and which aren't.  We
know that a substantial proportion will, but we don't have any method of
reliably identifying which of those individuals are at the highest risk for
such behaviour, and so it certainly would be appropriate for all sexual
offenders to ‑- to avoid those kinds of high risk situations.

 

Later he reiterated a similar sense of
frustration:

 

Again
though, one can never be fully satisfied in any situation as to being able to
relax the restrictions necessary.  I've had more cases than I would like to
think of in which an individual who seemed to be of the most benign sort and to
be well treated and the problem seemed to be thoroughly dealt with, and ‑-
and I really felt inclined to relax about the particular offender where, you
know, some horrendous thing comes out of the blue.  

 

                   So,
I mean, our ‑- our ability to ‑- to be certain that one can relax
surveillance or restrictions on a particular individual is not very good at
this point in history.  Our methods of assessing sexual offenders are
relatively crude and we ‑- the best therapists in this area frequently
get nasty surprises in which they ‑- they realize that they have been
naive.  We don't have very good methods of being able to make accurate
predictions about what will happen with an individual, so one can speak in
relative terms of individuals who have lesser or greater risk and where
restrictive conditions are more or less necessary or appropriate, but it ‑-
one would never encounter a situation in which you could say that you could
totally relax and completely omit any concern about a future problem.

 

(See
also the evidence of Dr. Glackman.)

 

The concerns with regard to crossover
and the potentially perpetual nature of the risk of re-offending contributed to
the conclusion of both Dr. Glackman and Dr. Semrau that a person who
was convicted of a ""date rape"" type sexual assault offence or a
random sexual assault offence involving physical contact would be a person who
should be subject to the kind of prohibition contained in s. 179(1) (b). 
The evidence on cross-offending and the difficulty of predicting who will
cross-offend or repeat offend would thus seem to justify some form of
restriction on the liberty of persons convicted of sexual offences given our
current state of knowledge.

 

                   Taking the above as
a whole, the objectives embodied in the s. 179(1) (b) prohibition
are relatively clear.  The courts below have unanimously recognized that the
section has at its foundation a concern for public safety and a desire to aid
in the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders.  I agree and would stress
that the provision applies broadly to all persons convicted of the enumerated
offences and therefore provides protection not only to children but also to
others who could be victims of sexual assault in the listed areas.  These
areas, it should be remembered, are places where people will generally lower
their guard.

 

                   The above, though,
does not allow us to identify as easily the specific conduct prohibited.  The
identified objectives are clearly achieved, and perhaps most efficiently, by
the broad interpretation of the prohibition adopted by Cory J.  A less
intrusive interpretation which prohibits the persons affected from being in one
of the enumerated places for a malevolent or ulterior purpose related to the
predicate offences, however, is also consistent with the objectives.  The more
narrow interpretation would go beyond a mere ""attempts"" offence.  It
would preserve the preventive aspect of the section by allowing the state to
deal with activities that are part of the cycle of re-offending, such as taking
photos, which can be proven to reflect a malevolent or ulterior purpose related
to the predicate offences.  At the same time, this interpretation would allow
the affected persons to use the listed areas for the legitimate purposes for
which they were intended.

 

                   The deletion of
""wandering"" and the use of the word ""loitering"" as opposed
to simply ""attending at"" or some other formulation can be seen as
reflecting a concern to limit the scope of the prohibition.  Portions of the
legislative debates which I have noted above can also be invoked in this
regard.  My conclusion to adopt the less intrusive interpretation, however, is
supported by the case law interpreting offences defined in terms of loitering
as well as the statutory context in which s. 179(1) (b) is situated.

 

B.Case Law Interpreting the Word
""Loiter"" and the Statutory Context of Section 179(1) (b)

 

                   As Cory J. has
noted, at p. 789, the ordinary or usual dictionary meaning of loiter is
""to stand idly around, hang around, linger, tarry, saunter, delay, dawdle,
etc.""  There is no suggestion in this definition that the term includes an
evil or malevolent purpose.  The dictionary definition of the French term ""flâner""
is similar.

 

                   The Canadian case
law interpreting the word ""loiter"" deals primarily with
ss. 175(1)(c) and 177 of the Code:

 

                   175. (1)  Every one who 

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c)
loiters in a public place and in any way obstructs persons who are in that
place, ... 

 

is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   177.  Every one who, without lawful
excuse, the proof of which lies on him, loiters or prowls at night on the
property of another person near a dwelling-house situated on that property is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

As will be seen, the interpretation
given to ""loiter"" in relation to these sections, though generally
involving some part of the ordinary meaning of the word, has not been exactly
the same in all cases.

 

                   In R. v. Munroe
(1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 217, per Cory J.A., as he then was, and in R.
v. Gauvin (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 229, the Ontario Court of Appeal gave
loiter its ordinary meaning in the context of s. 175(1)(c):  idly
hanging about.  Munroe dealt with a woman suspected of being a
prostitute, while Gauvin concerned a man who insisted upon taking a seat
reserved for others at a political meeting.  In both cases the court refused to
convict the accused persons on the basis that their activities were purposeful. 
Purposeful activity was held to be the antithesis of idleness.

 

                   In terms of
prohibited physical activity, loiter has been given a similar meaning in the
context of s. 177.  In R. v. Cloutier (M.) (1991), 51 Q.A.C. 143,
66 C.C.C. (3d) 149, the Quebec Court of Appeal also gave loiter its ordinary
dictionary meaning and noted the absence of purpose as a defining element.  In
distinguishing loiter from prowl (""flâner"" from ""rôder""),
the court underlined the ""innocent"" nature of loiter as compared to
prowl.  The court wrote, at pp. 147-48 Q.A.C. and at pp. 154-55
C.C.C., respectively:

 

                          [translation] In the loiterer, he
sees an individual who is wandering about, apparently without precise
destination, who does not have, in his manner of moving, a purpose or reason to
do so other than to pass the time, who is not looking for anything identifiable
and who often is merely motivated by the whim of the moment....  In short, it
is conduct which essentially has nothing reprehensible about it if, as required
by s. [177], it does not take place on private property where, in principle, a
loiterer has no business.

 

                   Opposite
to this, for the average person, ""prowl"" inspires a pejorative
reaction.  The verb includes a notion of evil; it depreciates in his eyes the
person who is involved in the action that it represents.

 

Similarly, in R. v. Lozowchuk
(1984), 32 Sask. R. 51 (Q.B.), Geatros J. held that the accused could not be
convicted of loitering within the terms of s. 177 because, in going to his
girlfriend's home late one evening, he had a definite purpose in mind.

 

                   The interpretation
of s. 177, however, has not been entirely consistent.  In at least one
case, a Court of Appeal has departed from the interpretation that the offence
is defined by the absence of purpose associated with idleness.  In R. v.
Andsten and Petrie (1960), 33 C.R. 213, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal upheld the convictions of two private detectives who had been snooping
around the complainant's house looking for evidence which would be relevant to
divorce proceedings.  The court concluded that ""hanging around""
expressed what was meant by loiter in s. 177.  The existence or absence of
a purpose was held to be irrelevant to the question of whether a person is loitering
within the terms of s. 177 (ibid., at p. 214). 
Davey J.A., perhaps foreseeing the difficulties presented by the different
uses of the word loiter in the Code, was careful to stress that the
court's discussion of the meaning of loiter was restricted to issues involving
invasion of private property.

 

                   In my view, the
case law summarized above suggests that the term ""loiter"" will vary
to some extent according to its context.  Ascribing an absence of purpose may
make sense in terms of s. 175; however, as at least Andsten and Petrie,
supra, clearly demonstrated, it may not be applicable under
s. 177.  Similarly, the absence of purpose element in the ordinary meaning
of loiter can have no application in the context of s. 179(1) (b). 
Clearly Parliament intended to include conduct of convicted sex offenders whose
purpose was related to re-offending.

 

                   My suggestion that
the meaning of loiter will vary according to the specific statutory context is
merely an illustration of a caveat to the general rule that words be given
their ordinary meaning.  Pierre-André Côté expressed this caveat in The
Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1992), at p. 221 (as
quoted below), citing Laskin C.J., in Attorney General for Ontario v.
Regional Municipality of Peel, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1134, at p. 1145:

 

                   The
need to determine the word's meaning within the context of the statute
remains.  Dictionaries provide meanings for a number of standard and recurring
situations.  Even the best of them will only tersely indicate the context in
which a particular meaning is used.  The range of meanings in a dictionary is
necessarily limited.  It cannot be sufficiently repeated ""how much context
and purpose relate to meaning"".

 

An illustration of this basic principle
in relation to the word loiter and of the nuances which arise from context is
found in a recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Attorney-General
of Hong Kong v. Sham Chuen, [1986] 1 A.C. 887.

 

                   In Sham Chuen,
the Privy Council considered s. 160(1) of the Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance. 
Section 160(1) made it an offence to loiter in a public place or in the common
parts of any building unless the person was able to give a satisfactory account
of her/his presence.  The crucial portions of the Privy Council's reasoning as
to the scope of the offence are contained in a single rather long paragraph. 
For ease of discussion, I have broken the paragraph (at pp. 895-96) into
two parts.

 

                   A
considerable amount of argument before the Board was directed to the meaning of
""loitering"" in section 160(1).  Given that the acceptable dictionary
meaning of the word was simply ""lingering"", three possible
constructions of the word in its present context were suggested.  These were
(i) any lingering; (ii) lingering with no apparent purpose at all; and (iii)
lingering in circumstances which suggest an unlawful purpose....  Reference was
made at some length to the legislative history of this particular enactment and
of similar enactments in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, as well as to a
number of reported decisions on the interpretation of such enactments.  In
their Lordships' opinion no helpful guidance is to be obtained from any of
them.  The word is to be construed in the light of the context in which it
appears in this particular enactment.

 

My review of the Canadian case law
summarized above supports the Privy Council's suggestion that the task of
ascertaining the specific meaning of ""loiter"" and therefore of the
offence of which loiter is an element in any given case will not always be
eased by referring to the interpretation of other enactments.  Rather, as I
have suggested and as the Privy Council concluded, a contextual approach
attuned to the particular enactment is more apposite.  The Privy Council's
contextual interpretation of s. 160(1), however, is of some assistance to the
interpretive question now before this Court.  The Privy Council wrote, at
p. 896:

 

Subsections
(2) and (3) of section 160 are each concerned with loitering of a particular
character, the first being loitering which causes an obstruction and the second
being loitering which causes reasonable concern to a person for his safety or
well-being.  In their Lordships' opinion subsection (1) is also concerned with
loitering of a particular character, namely loitering which calls for a
satisfactory account of the loiterer and a satisfactory explanation for his
presence.  Obviously a person may loiter for a great variety of reasons, some
entirely innocent and others not so.  It would be unreasonable to construe the
subsection to the effect that there might be subjected to questioning persons
loitering for plainly inoffensive purposes, such as a tourist admiring the
surrounding architecture.  The subsection impliedly authorises the putting of
questions to the loiterer, whether by a police officer or by any ordinary
citizen.  The putting of questions is intrusive, and the legislation cannot be
taken to have contemplated that this would be done in the absence of some
circumstances which make it appropriate in the interests of public order.  So
their Lordships conclude that the loitering aimed at by the subsection is
loitering in circumstances which reasonably suggest that its purpose is other
than innocent.

 

Despite the absence of any sort of
charter of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, the Privy Council concluded that
the legislation should be given a circumscribed interpretation so that
""innocent"" loitering was not subject to criminal sanction.  The Privy
Council's decision demonstrates that the word ""loiter"" on its own may
create an offence which is excessively intrusive.  Generally, this has been the
chief problem identified in regard to vagrancy or loitering provisions (see the
discussion contained in the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Papachristou
v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972)).  As the decision in Sham
Chuen, supra, demonstrates, however, such excessive intrusiveness
can and should be avoided where it would be consistent with the statutory
context.

 

                   As stated at the
outset, I am of the view that the prohibition contained in s. 179(1) (b)
should be narrowed to render the prohibition less intrusive and to tailor it
more carefully to the objectives being pursued.  Just as in Sham Chuen, supra,
not all loitering should be caught by the prohibition contained in
s. 179(1) (b).  Rather, the intrusion into the activities of
individuals should be tied to some reason of public order.  The three
provisions in which loiter is used in our Code suggest a structure with
some parallels to the situation in Hong Kong.  In each case, it is loitering of
a particular character which is being prohibited.  Section 175(1)(c)
deals with loitering which causes an obstruction.  Section 177 pertains to
loitering at night on the property of another without lawful excuse.  In this
context, s. 179(1) (b) prohibits loitering related to the enumerated
sexual offences.  The enumerated offences thus qualify the word
""loiter"" and limit the otherwise broad scope of the prohibition.

 

                   I draw additional
support for narrowing the scope of the prohibition created by s. 179(1) (b)
from the opinion of a distinguished commentator of the Code.  In the
1962 edition of his treatise, Droit pénal canadien, Irénée Lagarde
explained the antecedent version of s. 179(1) (b) as follows, at
p. 224:

 

[translation]  [Persons who
have been convicted of one of the enumerated offences] may not
""loiter"" or ""prowl"" near (1) a school, (2) a
playground, (3) a public park or (4) a public beach.  Like anyone else such a
person is entitled to sit on a bench in a public park, to bathe at a public
beach and to be found near a school or playground.  The legislature is
prohibiting not his or her presence but ""loitering"" or
""prowling"".  What are we to understand by these terms?  It seems to
me that they mean a presence which tends to indicate a probable guilty
intent and which by its persistence might reasonably suggest that the
accused has the intention of sexually attacking children or adults.  In other
words, the legislature prohibits him or her from hanging about near a schoolyard,
public beach or playground without any specific purpose.  In a public park, the
accused may relax peacefully but without ""watching"", ""being on
the lookout for"" or ""abnormally observing"" persons who might
become his or her victims.  The particular circumstances of the case will
determine whether or not there was ""loitering"".  [Emphasis in
original.]

 

While I do not entirely agree with
Lagarde's description of the offence, his concern to exclude from the criminal
prohibition presence in the enumerated areas for legitimate purposes would
appear to be well founded.  I also support the suggestion that the restriction
created by s. 179(1) (b) will not be the same in each of the listed
areas.  While it may be perfectly legitimate to rest in a public park with no
other apparent purpose, the same cannot be said for hanging around a school
yard.  An application of the section which is not sensitive to these points
will create a prohibition which is more intrusive than necessary.

 

                   Additional support
for the interpretation I would give to s. 179(1) (b) is found when
the section is analyzed in conjunction with ss. 161 and 810.1.  Sections
161 and 810.1 were enacted by Parliament following the decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.  Section 161 allows a court at the
time of sentencing to make an order prohibiting a sexual offender from attending
at day care centres, school grounds, playgrounds, community centres, or any
public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are
present or can reasonably by expected to be present.  The section relies on a
similar list of offences to that contained in s. 179(1) (b), but the
s. 161 prohibition is available only in relation to persons who have
committed offences against children under the age of 14.  The prohibition may
be for life or any shorter duration and the court which makes the order can
vary it at any time on application of the offender or the prosecutor.  This
provision is thus a powerful means of enhancing public safety and aiding offender
treatment.  Section 161 though does not apply to sex offenders convicted
prior to its enactment.

 

                   Sections 179(1) (b)
and 810.1 read together, however, produce a similar result to that achieved by
s. 161 in relation to those convicted prior to the enactment of s. 161. 
Section 810.1 allows any person who has reasonable grounds to fear that
another person will commit one of a number of sexual offences to appear before
a provincial court judge and seek an order prohibiting the person in question
from attending areas where children under 14 are likely to be present. 
This procedure, while eventually achieving the same result as s. 161,
would obviously require the expenditure of significant time and energy before a
prohibition could be ordered.  The interpretation I would give to
s. 179(1) (b) allows it to serve as a useful means for law
enforcement officers to take immediate preventive steps when a person who has
been convicted of one of the enumerated sexual offences is in one of the listed
areas and demonstrates an ulterior or malevolent purpose related to the
predicate offences.  In short, the provision allows the police to intervene
before a previous offender re-offends.  In such cases, s. 810.1 would then
be available to subject the offender to a prohibition similar to s. 161 if
it can be shown that there are reasonable grounds to fear that the person will
commit one of the predicate offences specified in s. 161.  Satisfying the
requirements of s. 179(1) (b) and demonstrating that the accused had
a malevolent or ulterior purpose related to one of the predicate offences would
no doubt help to satisfy the reasonable grounds requirement in s. 810.1. 
An excessively broad view of the prohibition contained in s. 179(1) (b)
would destroy this symmetry.

 

                   My review of the
legislative history, purpose and context of s. 179(1) (b) thus leads
to the conclusion that the offence should be interpreted as lingering or
hanging about the enumerated areas for a malevolent or ulterior purpose related
to any of the predicate offences.  This interpretation is suggested by the
terms of the offence and general desire to limit the intrusiveness of the
prohibition while still achieving the objectives of public safety and offender
treatment.  As will be seen in the next section, this interpretation is also
consistent with the Charter .

 

C.  Section 179(1)(b) and
Its Conformity with the Charter 

 

                   The two primary Charter 
concerns raised by s. 179(1) (b) pertain to vagueness and
overbreadth.  The interpretation of the provision adopted by Filmer Prov.
Ct. J. and Melvin J., requiring proof of an ""untoward or improper
motive"", is arguably unconstitutionally vague.  Cory J.'s broader
interpretation of s. 179(1) (b) eliminates any vagueness problem,
but, in his view, leads to a prohibition which is unjustifiably overbroad.  The
interpretation I have adopted avoids both these problems.

 

                   As discussed in R.
v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at p. 643,
a provision which is unconstitutionally vague provides an intolerable level of
prosecutorial discretion and fails to give those subject to the provision
notice of its content.  Put in its most simplistic form, what is prohibited
will be what those charged with law enforcement decide at any given moment
should be prohibited.  Interpreting s. 179(1)(b) to prohibit
lingering with an ""untoward or improper motive"" would arguably be an
example of an unconstitutionally vague restriction on liberty.  ""Untoward
or improper motive"" gives little basis for legal debate within the terms
of Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society.  It is difficult to identify the
factors to be considered or the determinative elements in ascertaining whether
a motive is untoward or improper.  The United States Supreme Court made a
similar suggestion in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra,
at p. 164.  Qualifying malevolent or ulterior purposes by reference to the
predicate offences, however, eliminates any concerns as to vagueness.  The
enumerated offences provide a clear basis for legal debate and narrow the scope
of potential liability.  The persons affected would thus have notice of what is
prohibited and prosecutorial discretion would be sufficiently restricted.

 

                   Cory J.,
however, suggests that the prohibition created by s. 179(1)(b) is
overbroad in terms of the persons, places and time period to which it applies. 
I express no opinion on the soundness of this analysis of liberty because it is
not necessary in this case to decide the issue.  The interpretation I advocate
eliminates Cory J.'s concern that the prohibition is overbroad.  A
lifetime prohibition of activities with a malevolent or ulterior purpose
related to re-offending is in no way objectionable or overbroad.  Such a
prohibition would impose a restriction on the liberty of the affected
individuals to which ordinary citizens are not subject, but that restriction is
directly related to preventing re-offending.  The affected persons' history of
offending, the uncertainties prevalent in treating offenders and a desire to
disrupt the cycle of re-offending justify what is in effect a minor intrusion
which does not breach the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   That restraint of
the affected persons' liberty is minor and easily illustrated.  As noted above,
use of public parks for the legitimate purposes for which they are intended
would not be caught.  Furthermore, though trite, it must be remembered that the
Crown will bear the burden of proving all elements of the offence beyond a
reasonable doubt.  This burden guarantees that only loitering which can be
proven to be related to one of the predicate offences will be subject to the
criminal prohibition.  I recognize that this formulation of the offence will
likely lead to certain evidentiary presumptions which, absent a satisfactory
explanation, may cause a judge to draw an adverse inference.  Take for example
a person with a history of offences in relation to children who is observed
hanging around a playground and offering children candy.  Similarly, as
discussed above, just lingering about a school yard with no apparent purpose,
as distinct from a public park, would give rise to legitimate suspicions.  Such
presumptions, however, in no way reverse the burden of proof, nor do they
violate the accused's right to silence.

 

                   One of the most
obvious objections to the more narrow formulation is that it is potentially
less efficient than the alternatives in terms of achieving the legislative
objective.  As I noted above, a broad prohibition preventing certain persons
from even attending at areas where the risk of re-offending is high may be a
superior way to achieve the objectives of public safety and offender
treatment.  As Cory J. convincingly demonstrates, however, for such a
broad prohibition to be constitutional, it would probably have to be
accompanied by the same kind of guarantees present in the new s. 161.  It
is well beyond the proper scope of the judicial role to contemplate such
extensive additions in this case.

 

                   In addition to
overbreadth, the absence of any notice of the prohibition contained in
s. 179(1)(b) was relied upon by Cory J. in concluding that
s. 7  of the Charter  was violated.  The basis for this conclusion
was that notice is provided for in the case of certain other prohibitions
contained in the Code and that the lack of notice in the case of
s. 179(1) (b) ""is unfair and unnecessarily so"".  In so
concluding, Cory J. would make notice, albeit in limited circumstances, a
principle of fundamental justice.  With all due respect, I cannot agree.  It is
a basic tenet of our legal system that ignorance of the law is not an excuse
for breaking the law.  This fundamental principle has been given legislative
expression in s. 19  of the Criminal Code :  ""Ignorance of the
law by a person who commits an offence is not an excuse for committing that
offence.""  Though formal notice of the content of s. 179(1) (b)
might be preferable, I can see no basis for transforming the legislator's
decision to provide notice in respect of certain Code prohibitions into
a principle of fundamental justice.

 

                   For his part and in
addition to s. 7 , the respondent alleges that s. 179(1)(b)
violates ss. 9 , 11 (d), (h) and 12  of the Charter . 
These allegations are without foundation and can be dismissed summarily.

 

                   Section 9  of
the Charter  provides a guarantee against being arbitrarily detained or
imprisoned.  The respondent's argument that any detention or imprisonment
pursuant to s. 179(1) (b) would be arbitrary related largely to his
objection to the absence of notice.  As I have stated, the absence of notice
does not provide a basis for attacking the validity of s. 179(1) (b). 
The reasoning set out above applies with equal force to the respondent's
arguments in respect of s. 9  of the Charter .

 

                   Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  enshrines the right to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty.  The respondent argues that s. 179(1) (b) presumes that an
offender will re-offend and therefore violates the presumption of innocence. 
In reality, the provision does not assume recidivism, but rather provides the
means to prevent it when convicted sex offenders demonstrate, through their
conduct, a malevolent intent related to re-offending.  Furthermore as I
stressed above, anyone charged under s. 179(1) (b) will be presumed
innocent and the burden remains on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused committed the offence as interpreted.

 

                   Section 11 (h)
protects a person found guilty and punished for an offence from being tried or
punished again for the same offence.  The class of persons to whom
s. 179(1)(b) applies is identified by the fact of having been
convicted of one of the enumerated offences.  Any conviction under that
section, however, will be based on violating its terms and not of having been
convicted of one of the enumerated offences.  Section 11 (h) is
therefore not violated.

 

                   Finally, the
s. 12  guarantee against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment is also
of no avail to the respondent.  Even if the respondent could demonstrate that
he is subject to a punishment or treatment within the meaning of s. 12 ,
which I doubt, it is clear that any such punishment or treatment is not cruel
and unusual.  A punishment or treatment will only be cruel and unusual where it
is ""so excessive as to outrage standards of decency"" or where its
effect is ""grossly disproportionate to what would have been
appropriate"" (see R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at
p. 1072; R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at p. 499).  As
explained above in the context of my discussion of s. 7  of the Charter ,
the lifetime prohibition of activities with a malevolent or ulterior purpose
related to re-offending is both a minor and justifiable restraint of the
affected persons' liberty.  In the circumstances, neither the prohibition
created by s. 179(1) (b) nor any punishment which would result from
its infringement can be said to be grossly disproportionate to what would be
appropriate or so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency.

 

                   Prohibiting
lingering or hanging about the enumerated areas for a malevolent or ulterior
purpose related to one of the predicate offences thus survives Charter 
scrutiny.  The predicate offences provide an ample basis for limiting
prosecutorial discretion and giving guidance as to what is prohibited to those
affected.  Furthermore, prohibiting only conduct which can be demonstrated to
be part of the cycle of re-offending carefully balances the objectives of
public safety and offender treatment with a desire to limit the intrusiveness
of the prohibition.

 

D.  Disposition

 

                   For the foregoing
reasons, s. 179(1)(b) of the Code should be interpreted as
prohibiting lingering or hanging about the enumerated areas for a malevolent or
ulterior purpose related to any of the predicate offences.  Based on this
interpretation the constitutional questions are, therefore, answered as
follows:

 

1.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , limit the right of the respondent to life, liberty and security
of the person as guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter ?

 

A. 
No.

 

3.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , limit the right of the respondent to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty according to law as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ?

 

A. 
No.

 

5.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 ,
limit the right of the respondent not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment as guaranteed by s. 12  of the Charter ?

 

A. 
No.

 

7.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , limit the right of the respondent not to be arbitrarily detained
or imprisoned as guaranteed by s. 9  of the Charter ?

 

A. 
No.

 

9.Does
s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985,
c. C-46 , limit the right of the respondent, if finally found guilty and
punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again, as
guaranteed by s. 11 (h) of the Charter ?

 

A. 
No.

 

Given the negative answers to
questions 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, it is unnecessary to answer questions 2, 4, 6, 8
and 10.

 

                   In this case, the
evidence demonstrated beyond any doubt that the accused had a malevolent
purpose related to the predicate offences.  I would therefore allow the appeal
and restore the accused's conviction.

authority ‑‑ Avenues available for third parties to challenge ban.

 

                   A young offender
was charged with a number of criminal offences, including sexual assaults on
two children.  Her trial was the first of a series of related trials involving
the same complainants.  The other accused were all adults.  The Crown in the
youth court trial applied for a non‑publication order and the CBC and
other news media were granted status to make representations on the
application.  The youth court judge banned the publication of the evidence and
proceedings at the young offender's trial until the trials of the other accused
were completed.  The CBC challenged the order on the ground that the youth
court judge had gone too far in applying the common law rule governing publication
bans, and in so doing had violated the CBC's freedom of expression. The Court
of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the CBC had no right of appeal to
the Court of Appeal and that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 

                   Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka,
Gonthier, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.: The general principles and
practices enunciated in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994]
3 S.C.R. 835, on the jurisdictional issue should be adopted.  The Crown's
application for a ban was correctly brought before the judge in charge of the
youth court trial and the CBC should have made an application for certiorari
to a superior court judge to challenge the publication ban order.  The Court of
Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear the CBC's appeal.  While this Court
has jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Court of Appeal's decision, it
does not have jurisdiction to review the order itself.  Had the CBC applied for
certiorari to a superior court judge, an appeal would have been
available to the Court of Appeal under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code 
and then to this Court under s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  It
is not open to this Court to grant leave to appeal the order itself proprio
motu, nunc pro tunc, ex post facto since there is no direct appeal avenue
to this Court from an order banning publication made by a provincial court
judge.

 

                   Per La Forest J.: Subject to the comments
in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, Lamer
C.J.'s reasons were agreed with. 

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.:  The
CBC had no right of appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal or to this Court
since there is no third party right of appeal from an interlocutory criminal
order.  While a third party can challenge an interlocutory criminal order by
way of certiorari where such an order was issued by a provincial court
judge, the CBC made no such challenge. 

 

                   Where the order
being reviewed is the product of a provincial court judge's legally authorized
discretion, a challenge by way of certiorari should only rarely
succeed.  This extraordinary remedy cannot be used to substitute one judge's
discretion for that of another.  Furthermore, a discretionary order per se cannot
be challenged on Charter grounds as the Charter does not apply to
court orders per se.  While the Charter applies to common law
rules authorizing such court orders, the common law rule governing the issuance
of publication bans in criminal proceedings is consistent with the Charter
and, consequently, any challenge to this aspect of the common law must fail. 
The question of whether the remedial powers of certiorari ought to be
enlarged should be left for an appropriate case.

 

                   Per McLachlin J.:  For the reasons
given on the jurisdictional issue in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, Lamer C.J.'s disposition is agreed with.

C.J. --

 

I. Factual and Procedural
Background

 

I.                 T.S., now 22 years of age, was
charged with a number of offences under the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. Y-1 . It was alleged that between May 1, 1988 and July 31, 1991 she had
committed sexual assaults on two children, touched them for sexual purposes,
confined them, threatened to use a weapon on one of them, and uttered a threat
to cause death to one of them.

 

II.                The respondent Crown made an
application under s. 486  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s.
39 of the Young Offenders Act and the common law for either an order of
non-publication of any of the evidence or an order of non-publication of
evidence relating to the allegations of the children.  The appellant, the
respondent Armadale Communications and media representatives, sought leave to
make representations in relation to the application.  The trial of T.S. was the
first of a series of related trials, involving the same complainants, but her
trial was the only one where a request for a restriction on publication of
evidence was made.

 

III.               A voir dire was held and
Lavoie Prov. Ct. J. of the provincial youth court ruled that media
representatives could be present but could not cross-examine the witnesses. 
They were allowed to submit oral or written arguments but were not given leave
to call viva voce evidence or to file affidavit evidence.  However, they
were allowed to re-apply to the court for such leave at any stage of the voir
dire.  

 

IV.              On March 3, 1993, Lavoie Prov. Ct.
J. granted the application and ordered the prohibition of the publication of
all of the evidence and proceedings in this trial (except the ruling on the voir
dire and the verdict therein) until the trials involving the same
complainants were completed.  The appellant appealed the decision on the voir
dire to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan.  On March 11, 1993, the Court
of Appeal ruled (with reasons to follow) that it did not have jurisdiction to
hear the appeal.  On May 25, 1993, the Court of Appeal released its reasons:
(1993), 109 Sask. R. 96, 42 W.A.C. 96, 82 C.C.C. (3d) 352, 15 C.R.R. (2d) 263.
On October 14, 1993, leave to appeal the Court of Appeal decision to the
Supreme Court of Canada was granted, [1993] 3 S.C.R. v.

 

II. Decisions Below

 

Provincial Youth Court

 

V.                Lavoie Prov. Ct. J. held that he
had no statutory power to ban publication in this case.  However, he held that
there was power at common law to make an order banning publication.  He then
held that:

 

                   As
to publication, there are two important but competing issues.  First, the
ever-important and at times almost overwhelming need to protect the child
victim witness during a court process and prevent that which ""would be
seriously injurious or seriously prejudicial"" to them as contemplated by
s. 39 of the Young Offenders Act.  Secondly, the freedom of expression
including freedom of the press under s. 2 (b) and the right to a ""public
hearing"" under s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  The role of the court is to find
a procedure which will best balance and protect these two, in this case,
opposing issues.  A solution which may be perfect in relation to one interest
may not be so for the other.  The court must be evermindful that the procedure
be a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 

He noted that the Crown was asking for
non-publication not only for the protection of the child witnesses but also to
protect the integrity and fairness of the trials of the adult accused which
will take place in the Court of Queen's Bench.

 

VI.              Lavoie Prov. Ct. J. found that the
evidence in relation to the fears of the children did not establish that
publication of the proceedings would destroy any further counselling although
it could delay therapy or possibly make it more difficult.   Nevertheless, he
ruled that: 

 

                   There
will be an order of non-publication of the evidence and proceedings in this
trial, except this ruling on the voir dire and the verdict herein, by any means
and in any way including any document, book, newspaper or broadcast.  Such
order shall be in effect until a verdict is rendered in the trials of the
charges, involving the same complainants, against the following adult accuseds
. . .; or the charges having been determined according to law by stay of
proceeding, withdrawal, dismissal or other lawful disposition.  For further
clarity such order does not extend to any appeals that may occur after verdict
is rendered in the trials.

 

Court of Appeal (1993), 109 Sask. R. 96

 

VII.             The Court of Appeal held that the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (""CBC"") had no right of appeal to
the Court of Appeal and that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear
the appeal.  Bayda C.J.S., writing for the court, began by noting that the
trial judge had ordered the publication ban pursuant to a power vested in him
by the common law.  He further observed that the CBC had not claimed that the
common law rule stated by Watt J. in Re Church of Scientology of Toronto and
The Queen (No. 6) (1986), 27  C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 209, and
applied by Lavoie Prov. Ct. J. was actually not the law.  Nor had the CBC
attacked the ruling on the ground that the common law rule was
unconstitutional.  Rather, Bayda C.J.S. noted, the CBC had attacked the order on
the ground that Lavoie Prov. Ct. J., in applying the common law rule, had gone
too far, and in so doing had violated the CBC's freedom of expression as
embodied in s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
It was on this basis that the CBC sought to have the order set aside.

 

VIII.            Bayda C.J.S. continued by observing
that if the appeal before him were treated simply as an ordinary appeal in a
criminal proceeding, then, following s. 674  of the Criminal Code , the
CBC would have no right of appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.  Appeals
are solely creatures of statute, Bayda C.J.S. remarked, and there is no
inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court.  Moreover, he declared, jurisdiction
in this case could not be found in s. 6 of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-42: R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764. 
Similarly, jurisdiction could not be grounded in the inherent power vested in
the Court of Appeal by s. 24(1)  of the Charter  and s. 52(1)  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 .  In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, if the appeal in the case at bar were
seen as an appeal from an interlocutory ruling by the trial court judge in the
course of a criminal proceeding, then the fact that it involved an alleged Charter 
breach did not vest the Court of Appeal with any special power to hear an
appeal.  Rather, the right of appeal was governed by the same principles that
applied to an appeal from an ordinary interlocutory ruling (and there is no
appeal from an interlocutory ruling made in a criminal proceeding).

 

IX.              Alternatively, if the appeal were
characterized as an appeal from a final ruling (in so far as the CBC was
concerned), Bayda C.J.S. noted that it was ""important to keep in mind the
nature of the Charter  component upon which the C.B.C. relie[d] as the
basis for its appeal"" (p. 104).  He remarked (at p. 104):

 

C.B.C.
has not appealed a ruling by a trial judge finding a violation by a
governmental official of a person's Charter  right and awarding to the
person a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter ....  Rather, C.B.C.
contends that it was the trial judge himself who was the violator of C.B.C.'s
s. 2 (b) Charter  right, and it was his ruling that created the violation. 
It now seeks a remedy under s. 24(1)  to redress that violation.  The remedy it
seeks is a setting aside of the judge's ruling.

 

Consequently, Bayda C.J.S. noted, the
CBC was asking the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to make an initial ruling
respecting the alleged violation.  This amounted to asking the Court of Appeal
to act as the court of first instance under s. 24(1) .  Bayda C.J.S. stated (at
p. 105):

 

In
my respectful view, this court's jurisdiction, whatever it may be, does not
extend that far.  The court by definition is not a court of first instance. 
Although the court does have original jurisdiction in situations involving a
review by way of prerogative writs [citations omitted], the jurisdiction which
C.B.C. seeks to engage in the present case is not that jurisdiction. 

 

Furthermore, Bayda C.J.S. observed
that in RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, the
Supreme Court of Canada had ""held that a judge acting in his or her
judicial capacity cannot be a Charter  right violator and an order of a
court cannot, for the purpose of a Charter  application, constitute the
necessary ""governmental action"" upon which to found a Charter 
violation and a consequential remedy to redress the violation.  In short,
although courts are bound by the Charter  as they are bound by all law,
the Charter  does not apply to court orders"" (p. 105).

 

X.                For these reasons, Bayda C.J.S.
concluded that the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear an
appeal  from Lavoie Prov. Ct. J.'s ruling.  He remarked, however, at p. 107,
that:

 

                   The
nature of C.B.C.'s complaint and its legal inability to have the propriety of
the ruling it received respecting that complaint immediately tested on appeal,
leaves one with a sense of unease.  Given the structure of our appellate law,
it is Parliament, and Parliament alone, that is empowered to relieve that
unease by providing some form of immediate appellate review -- apart from s. 40 
of the Supreme Court Act . . . .

 

He noted that in other contexts
Parliament had been able to establish efficacious appeal procedures, and
observed that the English Parliament had established appeal procedures in
respect of publication ban orders.

 

III. Analysis

 

XI.              With respect to the general
principles and practices for the jurisdictional question, I adopt my reasons in
Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835.  With respect
to the application of the general principles and practices to the case at bar,
I draw the following conclusions.

 

A. The Facts

 

XII.             The case of T.S. was being heard in
the provincial youth court of Saskatchewan.  The trials of the adult accused
arising out of similar circumstances (Ronald Sterling, Linda Sterling, Travis
Sterling, James Elstad, Darryl Ford, Edward Revesz, Darren Sabourin, John
Popowich) were scheduled to commence in the Saskatoon Queen's Bench Court
(provincial superior court) in May 1993 and to be heard continuously and
consecutively until sometime in 1994.

 

B. The Application of the Law to
the Facts

 

XIII.            The Crown brought the motion to the
correct judge (the judge in charge of the trial of T.S.).  The CBC tried to
appeal the trial judge's decision to the Court of Appeal.  The CBC should have
made an application for certiorari to a superior court judge because the
trial judge was a judge in the provincial youth court and that is not a
provincial superior court.  If the application had been denied, then the CBC
could have appealed the superior court judge's decision to the Court of Appeal
(under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code ).

 

C. The Disposition on Jurisdiction

 

XIV.            The Court of Appeal did not have
jurisdiction to hear from the CBC.  While this Court had jurisdiction to hear
the appeal from the Court of Appeal decision, this Court does not have
jurisdiction to review the order itself.  The CBC should have made an
application for certiorari to the superior court.  From there, an appeal
was available to the Court of Appeal under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code . 
From there, an appeal was available to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .  Unlike in the companion case of Dagenais,
it is not open to this Court to grant leave to appeal the order itself proprio
motu, nunc pro tunc, ex post facto.  There is no direct appeal avenue to
the Supreme Court from an order banning publication made by a provincial court
judge.

 

IV. Disposition

 

XV.             I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. -- Subject to
my reasons in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R.
835, issued concurrently, I agree with the Chief Justice.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- I have read the
reasons of Lamer C.J. and agree that this appeal should be dismissed.  I reach
this conclusion, however, for somewhat different reasons.

 

XVI.            First, as I wrote in the companion
case of Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835,
there is no third party right of appeal from an interlocutory criminal order. 
This is true whether the order is issued by a superior court judge or a
provincial court judge.  In this respect, I agree fully with the reasons of
Bayda C.J.S. and find that the appellant had no right of appeal to the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and no right of appeal to this Court.  

XVII.          Nonetheless, while a third party cannot
challenge an interlocutory criminal order by way of appeal, I agree with Lamer
C.J. that a third party can challenge an interlocutory criminal order by way of
certiorari where the interlocutory order in question was issued by a
provincial court judge.  In the case at hand, however, the appellant made no
such challenge.  Accordingly, it is not strictly necessary to discuss the scope
of review under certiorari or the remedial power available to the
reviewing judge under this extraordinary remedy.  Nonetheless, I wish to
emphasize that where the order being reviewed is, as here, the product of a
provincial court judge's legally authorized discretion, a challenge by way of certiorari
should only rarely succeed.  Certiorari is an extraordinary remedy and
cannot be used to substitute one judge's discretion for that of another. 
Furthermore, a discretionary order per se cannot be challenged on Charter 
grounds as the Charter  does not, as I noted in Dagenais, apply to
court orders per se.  

 

XVIII.         While the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  does not apply to court orders per se, it does apply to
common law rules authorizing such court orders.  However, this said, I
concluded in Dagenais that the common law rule governing the issuance of
publication bans in criminal proceedings is consistent with the Charter . 
Consequently, any challenge to this aspect of the common law must fail.

 

XIX.            Finally, with respect to the remedial
powers of certiorari, I agree with Lamer C.J. that currently they are
limited to the power to quash the order or decision under review.  I leave open
the question of whether or not the expansion of these remedial powers proposed
by Lamer C.J. in obiter comments in Dagenais is appropriate in
the case of the judicial review of publication bans.

 

XX.             For the reasons outlined above, I
would dismiss the appeal.  

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- For the reasons
given on the jurisdictional issue in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, released concurrently, I agree with the disposition of the
Chief Justice.

 

                   Appeal dismissed.

S-26 , s. 40(1) , (3)  -- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 674 .
     The respondents, former and present members of a Catholic religious order, were charged with physical and sexual abuse of young boys in their care at training schools in Ontario.  They applied to a superior court judge for an injunction restraining the CBC from broadcasting the  mini-series The Boys of St-Vincent, a fictional account of sexual and physical abuse of children in a Catholic institution in Newfoundland, and from publishing in any media any information relating to the proposed broadcast of the program.  At the time of the hearing, the trials of the four respondents were being heard or were scheduled to be heard in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) before a judge and jury.  LD's trial was in its final stage and a trial judge had been appointed for LM's case.  The superior court judge granted the injunction, prohibiting the broadcast of the mini-series anywhere in Canada until the end of the four trials, and granted an order prohibiting publication of the fact of the application, or any material relating to it.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision to grant the injunction against the broadcast but limited its scope to Ontario and CBMT-TV in Montreal and reversed the order banning any publicity about the proposed broadcast and the very fact of the proceedings that gave rise to the publication ban.
     Held (La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the publication ban order set aside.
     Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ.:  To have a publication ban issued under a judge's common law or legislated discretionary  


page 837

authority, the Crown and/or the accused's motion should be made before the trial judge, if one has been appointed, or before a judge in the court at the level where the case will be heard.  If the level of court has not been established and cannot be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions, the motion should be made before a superior court judge.  In a jury trial, the  motion must be heard in the absence of the jury.  To challenge a ban on appeal, the Crown and the accused should follow the avenues of appeal available through the Criminal Code .  When the initial ban order is made by a judge other than the trial judge, some flexibility should be recognized in the application of the rule against collateral attacks.
     The judge hearing a motion for a publication ban has the discretion to direct that third parties be given notice and to grant them standing in accordance with the provincial rules of criminal procedure and the common law principles.  If third parties wish to oppose the motion, they should attend at the hearing, argue to be given status, and if given status, participate in the motion.  When third parties, usually the media, seek to challenge publication bans ordered by judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority, no direct appeal is available through the Criminal Code .  If the publication ban was ordered by a provincial court judge, the third party should make an application for certiorari to a superior court judge.  The common law rule does not authorize publication bans that limit Charter  rights in an unjustifiable manner, so an order implementing such a ban is an error of law on the face of the record.  While certiorari has traditionally been limited remedially, when a judge exceeds his authority under the common law rule governing publication bans, the remedies available through a certiorari challenge to the judge's action should be enlarged to be the same as the remedies that would be available under the Charter .  To challenge a denial of certiorari, third parties should appeal the superior court judge's decision to the Court of Appeal under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  To challenge a dismissal of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, they should apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  If the publication ban was ordered by a superior court judge, third parties should challenge the ban by applying for leave to the Supreme Court under s. 40(1) .  A publication ban order issued by a superior court judge can be seen as a final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province or a judge thereof in which judgment can be had in the particular case.  Neither s. 40(3) of the Act nor s. 674  of the Criminal Code  precludes an  


page 838

appeal to the Supreme Court under s. 40(1)  in such cases.
     Section 24(1)  of the Charter  is unavailable to challenge a publication ban since such a challenge can be framed in terms of error of law and since certiorari and s. 40(1)  are available.  Furthermore, given that a motion for a publication ban in the context of criminal proceedings is criminal in nature, the civil procedures avenues to challenge a ban are not available.
     Here, the superior court judge who issued the publication ban order had jurisdiction to hear only the motions for a ban made by JD and RR, since a trial judge had already been appointed for LD and LM.  The Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear the CBC's appeal, and this Court had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision and to draw these conclusions on the issue of jurisdiction.  This Court also had jurisdiction under s. 40(1)  to grant leave to appeal the initial order of the superior court judge.  The CBC, however, did not seek leave to appeal this order.  Because it would be unfair to penalize the CBC for not following the correct procedure where the correct procedure was unknown, because the issue of publication bans is of national importance, and because no one is prejudiced by the granting of leave, leave to appeal from that order should be granted under s. 40(1)  proprio motu, nunc pro tunc, ex post facto.
     This case deals with an error of law challenge to a publication ban imposed under a common law discretionary rule.  Discretion conferred by a common law rule must be exercised within the boundaries set by the Charter ; exceeding these boundaries results in a reversible error of law.  The traditional common law rule governing publication bans -- that there be a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial  


page 839

-- emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban and, in the context of post-Charter Canadian society, does not provide sufficient protection for freedom of expression.  When two protected rights come into conflict, Charter  principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance of both rights. A hierarchical approach to rights must be avoided, both when interpreting the Charter  and when developing the common law.  The common law rule governing publication bans must thus be reformulated in a manner that reflects the principles of the Charter  and, in particular, the equal status given by the Charter  to ss. 2 (b) and 11 (d).  Given that publication bans, by their very definition, curtail the freedom of expression of third parties, the common law rule must be adapted so as to require a consideration of both the objectives of a publication ban, and the proportionality of the ban to its effect on protected Charter  rights.  The modified rule may be stated as follows:  a publication ban should only be ordered when (a) such a ban is necessary in order to prevent a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, because reasonably available alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and (b) the salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the ban.  If the ban fails to meet this standard, then the judge committed an error of law in making the order and the challenge to the order on this basis should be successful.  This standard reflects the substance of the Oakes test, which itself should be rephrased to recognize in the third step of the proportionality branch that there must be a proportionality not only between the deleterious effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the rights or freedoms in question and the objective, but also between the deleterious and the salutary effects of the measures.
     Publication bans, however, should not always be seen as a clash between  freedom of expression for the media and the right to a fair trial for the accused.  The clash model is more suited to the American constitutional context and should be rejected in Canada.  Other important concerns have a place at each stage of the analysis that is required when considering whether a particular publication ban can be justified under the common law  


page 840

rule.  The efficacy of a publication ban is also a relevant factor in this analysis.
     The party claiming under the common law rule that a publication ban is necessary to avoid a real and serious risk to the fairness of the trial bears the burden of justifying the limitation on freedom of expression.  He must prove that the proposed ban is necessary, in that it relates to an important objective that cannot be achieved by a reasonably available and effective alternative measure, that the proposed ban is as limited as possible, and that there is a proportionality between the salutary and deleterious effects of the ban.  The fact that the party seeking the ban may be attempting to safeguard a constitutional right must be borne in mind when determining whether the proportionality test has been satisfied.  The judge should, where possible, review the publication ban at issue.  He must consider all other options besides the ban and find that there is no reasonable and effective alternative available.  He must also limit the ban as much as possible.  Lastly, the judge must weigh the importance of the objectives of the particular ban and its probable effects against the importance of the particular expression that will be limited to ensure that the positive and negative effects of the ban are proportionate.
     The publication ban in this case cannot be upheld.  While the ban was clearly directed toward preventing a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial of the four respondents, the initial ban was far too broad. It prohibited broadcast throughout Canada and even banned reporting on the ban itself.  In addition, reasonable alternative measures were available to achieve the objective  without circumscribing the expressive rights of third parties. The publication ban therefore cannot be supported under the common law.  In purporting to order the ban under her common law discretionary authority, the superior court judge thus committed an error of law.
     Per McLachlin J.: Court orders in the criminal sphere which affect an accused's Charter  rights or his ability to enforce them are themselves subject to the Charter .  The ban at issue in this case falls into this category.  The publication ban was related to the protection of the respondents' constitutional right to a fair trial and may be viewed as a case of the criminal law being applied to vindicate the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms protected by the Charter .  The ban was not made by Parliament or a legislature but can be considered an act of  


page 841

""government"" in relation to a matter within the authority of Parliament or the legislatures.
     Courts must be able to provide a full and effective remedy for any Charter  infringement.  This requires more than the opportunity to address the trial court prior to the issuance of the ban and must include recourse to an appellate tribunal. The appellate procedures proposed by Lamer C.J. for third party challenges of publication ban orders satisfy this minimal requirement.  While they involve some extension of the common law remedy of certiorari, this extension is warranted in the case of appeals from publication bans and hence justified under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  The extension is warranted because there is no other way that overbroad publication bans can effectively be limited on appeal. Given that the Charter  applies to a court-ordered publication ban, such a ban might be challenged on the basis of error of law in that it constitutes a direct violation of the Charter .  The proposed appellate procedures should not, however, be understood to derogate from the principle that criminal trials should not be interrupted and delayed for the purpose of pursuing interlocutory appeals.
     The right to broadcast a fictional cinematic work falls squarely within the ambit of s. 2 (b) of the Charter  and the limits on freedom of expression imposed by the ban must be justified under s. 1 .  The objective of the ban was to preserve the respondents' rights to a fair trial and, in particular, to avoid the risk that an impartial jury could not be sworn, or if sworn, could not render a true verdict because of the poisonous effects of the publication.  Under the proportionality branch of the Oakes test, a publication ban may be justified where there are special circumstances in a case which indicate a serious risk (as opposed to a speculative possibility) to the fairness of the trial, and provided that the ban goes no further than required to avoid the demonstrated risk of an unfair trial.

It is not a question of deciding where the balance should be struck between a fair trial and freedom of expression.  The right to a fair trial is fundamental and cannot be sacrificed. In general, the clash model is also largely inappropriate. The common law test governing the issuance of publication bans,  properly applied, meets the requirements of justification of an infringing measure under s. 1.  What is required is that the risk of an unfair trial be evaluated after taking full account of the  


page 842

general importance of the free dissemination of ideas and after considering measures which might offset or avoid the feared prejudice.  Here, the judge ordering the ban failed to direct herself to the considerations which go to establishing rational connection and minimal impairment.  It follows that the ban cannot be supported and must be set aside.
     Per Gonthier J. (dissenting):  The superior court judge was a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a publication ban in the cases of JD and RR; and, in doing so, she was bound to apply the Charter  and her decision constituted the implementation of a Charter  remedy under s. 24(1) .  She had no jurisdiction, however, to issue a ban on the applications of LD and LM who could only apply to their appointed trial judge.  The question of whether there is a right of review or appeal of the ban order bearing on its correctness and conformity with the Charter  rights of the persons affected thereby is a distinct issue.  By referring to a ""court of competent jurisdiction"", s. 24(1)  does not create courts of competent jurisdiction, but merely vests additional powers in courts which are already found to be competent independently of the Charter .  Further, s. 24(1) does not of itself create a right of review or appeal from a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction where such a right is already provided by law.  In this case, Lamer C.J.'s views as to rights of review by way of certiorari of publication ban orders by provincial court judges pursuant to the Charter  and rights of appeal pursuant to s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  were agreed with.
     Publication bans can be ordered to protect the fairness of a pending or current trial.  The fact such bans restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the press means that they should be imposed only in exceptional cases.  The exceptional nature of publication bans has been assured at common law by requiring that there be a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial.  The application of the Charter  to the evaluation of publication bans, while not directly altering the common law test, restructures the analysis to some extent.  In terms of Charter  review, determining the correct balance between fair trial and freedom of expression rights falls to the s. 1  analysis.  Under s. 1, each party bears an initial burden of showing a Charter  infringement.  After that initial burden is discharged, the balancing of competing Charter  rights is incompatible with a burden on  


page 843

either party and the s. 1 analysis should be carried on without privileging or disadvantaging either of the rights at issue.  The validity of imposing a ban under s. 1 will be determined almost exclusively at the second and third branches of the proportionality part of the Oakes test since the other elements of the test are easily satisfied.  The second or minimal impairment branch requires that bans be carefully limited both in terms of temporal and geographic application, and requires evaluation of alternative measures to protect the right to a fair trial.  The third branch requires proportionality between the effects of the measure limiting the freedoms in question and the objective, and also proportionality between the salutary and deleterious effects of that measure.

Thus,  in analysing publication bans through s. 1, the essence of the decision to issue a ban or not is a balancing of various factors to determine whether such a preventive measure is a necessary and reasonable response to the facts of any given case.  The trial judge must consider the nature of the threat to the fairness of the trial, including the susceptibility of juries to being influenced, the extent of the restriction on freedom of expression and the availability of alternative measures.  It is not necessary, however, for the trial judge to determine with certainty that the alternative measures would be insufficient to protect the fairness of the trial.  What is required is that the trial judge be satisfied that the publication will create a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, which available alternative measures will not prevent.  Where circumstances permit it is desirable for the trial judge to review the proposed publication as part of the evidence before determining whether to issue a ban.  Finally, the decision of a trial judge, made after weighing all the factors, should not be interfered with unless it is based on an error in principle or it cannot be reasonably supported on the evidence.
     Here, the superior court judge did not err in banning the broadcast of the mini-series until the end of the pending trials some eight months later.  The mini-series was a work of fiction based on a number of similar, ""almost interchangeable"", cases which was to be shown in prime time to a potentially huge audience.  On the basis of the evidence, it was open to the judge to find  that even though the mini-series was not directly about  


page 844

any of the respondents, it would have seriously compromised the possibility of finding an impartial jury given the context of widespread prior publicity, and that the alternative measures were bound to be ineffective.  Though this test differs on a formal level from the ""real and substantial risk"" test, they are equivalent in substance.  While the ban temporarily denied the appellants their freedom of expression, this impairment was very minor.  The mini-series is a work of fiction, not a news event, and could be broadcast later with minimal inconvenience.  Commercial loss cannot justify risking an accused's right to a fair trial, especially when a portion of the losses can be recouped when the mini-series is eventually broadcast.  Finally, the purpose of provoking public exploration of the issues of child physical and sexual abuse, as an integral part of a process of seeking solutions, was not frustrated by the temporary ban.  These issues would still have been topical at the end of the pending trials.  The geographic scope of the ban, however, was clearly overly broad.  Since there was no legal possibility that the trials could be moved outside Ontario, the ban should have been limited to any broadcast in the province and to CBMT-TV in Montreal.
     Per La Forest J. (dissenting):  There is no direct appeal to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  from the superior court judge's order.  On the basis of the reasoning in support of such an appeal, applications for leave from any number of interlocutory rulings in criminal proceedings could be made to this Court.  The appellants, however, are not without remedy.  Apart from declaratory actions, a remedy might well be available under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  even against a decision of a superior court judge.  Since a decision made under that provision is not otherwise open to appeal, it is a final order within the meaning of s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act , and so open to appeal with leave to this Court.  No other avenue or appeal route was available to the appellants to challenge the ban.
     The ban order is not immune from Charter  scrutiny by reason only that it is a court order.  The order is one exercised pursuant to a discretionary power directed at the governmental purpose of ensuring a fair trial.  It is a by-product, in this case having effect outside the criminal process, of the institution by the Crown of criminal proceedings.  The fact that the rule under which it was made was judicially created does not matter.  The  


page 845

Charter  applies to common law as well as to statutes.  Since the effect of the order was the infringement of the appellants' Charter  right to freedom of expression to serve a governmental purpose, the order may be subjected to Charter  scrutiny.
     If an expansion of certiorari jurisdiction is to be permitted when publication bans made by provincial court judges are being challenged, discretion to grant such a remedy should be exercised in a restrained manner to avoid undue interference with the trial process.  It might, in fact, be as well simply to leave third parties the right to apply for a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  That remedy is itself discretionary.  It is akin to a court's discretionary power to grant a declaration and should be exercised with similar restraints.
     Although it is unnecessary to consider the substantive issue, the following comments could be made in light of the disposition of the case by the Court.  There is agreement with Lamer C.J. that the common law rule did not give sufficient protection to freedom of expression, and substantial agreement with his list of factors a judge should consider in determining whether a ban should issue.  The extent to which a ban could disrupt the trial is another factor that should be weighed.
     Per L'Heureux-Dubé J. (dissenting):  Freedom of expression is a fundamental value in our free and democratic society. The jurisdictional issue raised in this case, however, concerns the right of appeal, not the right to freedom of expression.  The right to freedom of expression is protected by access to an initial remedy.  While the axiom ""where there is a right, there is a remedy"" may not be absolute, when a person alleges a wrong, that person is entitled to submit his case to a forum in order to try to obtain redress.  Here, the CBC was provided with such an opportunity:  the CBC had standing and was heard by a court of law prior to the issuance of the publication ban.  Even though the CBC was unsuccessful in preventing the issuance of the publication ban, it still had access to an initial remedy.  Consequently, the jurisdictional question raised by this appeal is not whether the CBC should have access to a remedy but whether the CBC should have a right to appeal a decision with which they are not satisfied.


page 846


     In this respect, the jurisdictional question has broad implications.  If the media are permitted to appeal a publication ban issued in the criminal context then every third party will be able to appeal any interlocutory order issued in the criminal context which they believe infringes their Charter  rights.  Such a broad interlocutory right of appeal will result in significant delay to the trial process, will adversely impact upon the accused's Charter  right to be tried within a reasonable time and will adversely affect the administration of justice.
     With this broad context in mind, this Court is found to have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.  Similarly, there was no jurisdiction in the Court of Appeal to hear this appeal.  In our free and democratic society, a right of appeal is not available in every situation.  With the exception of the possibility of a limited common law jurisdictional appeal, a right of appeal exists only if specifically provided by statute.  Here, the Criminal Code  does not provide for such a right. Furthermore, since this appeal qualifies as a proceeding in respect of an indictable offence, s. 674 of the Code does not authorize any other proceedings through which the ban can be challenged.  Even assuming, however, that s. 674  does not restrict the scope of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act, s. 40(1)  still does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to hear an appeal such as this one from an interlocutory criminal order.  To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the jurisprudence of this Court.  Section 40(1)  was intended to confer broad appellate jurisdiction on this Court, but it was not intended to override the principle against interlocutory criminal appeals.  This principle is equally applicable to the accused, the Crown and third parties.  While an order affecting a third party issued during a criminal proceeding may be final with respect to that third party, it is interlocutory with respect to the accused.  Since the focus in criminal proceedings must be on the accused and the determination of guilt and innocence, to the extent that the order is interlocutory from the accused's point of view it should not be subject to a third party appeal unless the right to such an appeal is specifically and clearly provided by statute.  Section 40(1)  does not meet this test. Just as it has not been interpreted to provide parties to criminal proceedings with an interlocutory right of appeal, it should not be so interpreted with respect to third parties.  Finally, the Charter  does not confer appellate jurisdiction.  Section 24(1)  cannot provide a right of appeal where none is provided by law.  It is only if there were no access whatsoever to an initial remedy that s. 24(1)  might confer jurisdiction to provide an initial remedy, such as  


page 847

giving a third party standing to raise the issue.  However, this is not such a case.  If third party interlocutory criminal appellate procedures are needed, it is Parliament, not the courts, which must develop such procedures.
     With respect to the applicability of the Charter  to court orders, while some judicial activity may be subject to the Charter , a court order per se is not.  The Charter  therefore does not apply to the impugned publication ban. The Charter  does, however, apply to the common law governing the issuance of publication bans.
     The initial motion for a publication ban should be made before the appointed trial judge wherever possible.  Since a trial judge had already been appointed for LD and LM, the superior court judge had no jurisdiction to hear their motions for a publication ban.
     On the substantive issue, had jurisdiction been found in this Court to entertain this appeal, Gonthier J.'s reasons would have been agreed with.  The common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans in the criminal law context is consistent with the Charter  and the superior court judge did not commit any reviewable error in exercising her discretion and applying the common law rule to the facts of this case and determining that a publication ban was necessary.

     The judgment of Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Cory, Iacobucci and Major JJ. was delivered by
     LAMER C.J. --

I. Factual Background
     This is an appeal from the judgment dated December 5, 1992 of the Ontario Court of Appeal restraining the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (""CBC"") from broadcasting a mini-series co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada (""NFB"") anywhere in Ontario or on the English-language station CBMT-TV in Montreal until the completion of the criminal trials of the four respondents.
     The respondents (Lucien Dagenais, Léopold Monette, Joseph Dugas and Robert Radford) are either former or present members of a Catholic religious order known as the Christian Brothers.  They were all charged with physical and sexual abuse that allegedly took place in Catholic training schools where the respondents were teachers and the victims were young boys in their care.
     At the time of the hearing on the publication ban, the trials of the four respondents were being heard or were scheduled to be heard in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) in front of judge and jury.  All of the respondents had been pre-tried and there was no prospect of pre-trial resolution.  Dagenais was in week five of his trial before Soublière J.  Monette was scheduled to be tried before Cusson J. from February 1 to February 26, 1993.  Trial judges had not yet been named for Radford or Dugas, but Radford's trial was scheduled to run from April 5 to May 4, 1993, and Dugas' trial was scheduled to commence some time between May 31 and July 2, 1993.
     In early November, the appellant CBC began advertising the nation-wide broadcast of a  


page 852

four-hour mini-series entitled The Boys of St. Vincent, a fictional account of sexual and physical abuse of children in a Catholic institution.  The broadcast was to be in two two-hour segments, one on Sunday evening, December 6, 1992, and the other on the following evening.
     Soublière J. was scheduled to charge the jury in Dagenais' trial on December 7.  On December 3, defence counsel brought an application before Soublière J. requesting that he charge the jury on December 4 instead of on December 7 or that he sequester the jury over the weekend of December 5 and 6.  Soublière J. declined to do either but he did direct the jury not to watch the broadcast.
     On December 4, 1992, the respondents turned to Madam Justice Gotlib, a colleague of Soublière J. in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division).  They applied for an interlocutory injunction under the Ontario Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, restraining the CBC from broadcasting The Boys of St. Vincent and from publishing in any media any information relating to the proposed broadcast of that program.  At the beginning of the hearing the application was amended to indicate that the application was for an injunction to last until the end of the four trials.  Gotlib J. of the Ontario Court of Justice granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the broadcast of The Boys of St. Vincent anywhere in Canada until the completion of the trials of the respondents.
     The respondents also requested and were granted an order permitting the hearing of the application on short notice.  In addition, they requested and were granted an order prohibiting the publication of the fact of the application, or any material relating to it, pending completion of the four trials (but not including any time involved in an appeal process).
     The NFB, John Newton Smith, and Thomson Newspapers Company Limited were added as appellants on appeal.  The Court of Appeal heard the appeal from Gotlib J.'s judgment on December 5, 1992, affirmed the lower court's decision to  


page 853

grant the injunction against the broadcast but limited the scope of the injunction to Ontario and CBMT-TV in Montreal and reversed the order banning any publicity about the proposed broadcast and the very fact of the proceedings that gave rise to the publication ban.
     II. Decisions Below
     Ontario Court of Justice (General Division)
     Gotlib J. made the following orders:
     1.THIS COURT ORDERS that this matter be heard on short notice.
     2.THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND PROHIBITS any publication of the fact of this Application or any of the material relating to it, until the completion of the criminal trials of the four Applicants, but not extending to any appeals therefrom.
     3.THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the Respondent, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, be and is hereby restrained from broadcasting the program ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" and from publishing in any media any information relating to the proposed broadcast of the program until the completion of the four criminal trials of the four applicants but not extending to any appeals therefrom.
     4.THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that this Court file be sealed, until the completion of the four criminal trials of the four applicants but not extending to any appeals therefrom.

In deciding to restrain the broadcast of the mini-series until after the trials of the respondents, Gotlib J. stated:
     I, too, have great faith in the jury system, as indicated in the cases, and by counsel before me.  Juries are not stupid.  They come, for the most part, from a variety of sophisticated backgrounds, and can understand and follow instructions from a judge.  What we have here, however, is, in the particular charges against the four [respondents], a highly explosive and inflammatory  


page 854

issue to be decided by, in effect, four separate juries in four separate courts.
     There has already been wide-spread publicity, and I take judicial notice of the large amount of publicity. There has been a substantial amount of publicity involving the Mount Cashel charges, and other educational institutions operated by the Christian Brothers, both in Ontario, Newfoundland, and elsewhere.  It may well be that in future trials (and I have no idea how, in the case before Justice Soublière, jury selection proceedings have been conducted) that potential jurors will have to be challenged for cause as to, first of all, their contact with publications already available, and secondly, if they have seen or read the material that pertains to other trials of a similar nature whether or not they feel that they can render an impartial verdict.  I see, however, no need to add fuel to the fire, particularly in view of the imminent dates for trial of the three remaining accused persons.  Those trials will be concluded, for the most part, by the fall of 1993.
     She summarized her position in the following manner:
     In all, I am satisfied that the harm that would be caused by the showing of this particular film before the jury trials of the three remaining accused persons would be such that the possibility of impartial jury selection virtually anywhere in Canada would be seriously compromised.  For that reason, I grant an interim injunction restraining the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from broadcasting the TV programme, ""The Boys of St. Vincent"", and from publishing further media information relating to the proposed broadcast until such time as the three remaining criminal trials are completed.
     Court of Appeal for Ontario (1992), 12 O.R. (3d) 239
     The Court of Appeal made the following orders:

1.THIS COURT ORDERS that the Judgment of Madam Justice Gotlib dated December 4, 1992 be varied and the same is varied as follows:
     (a)Paragraphs 2 and 4 of the Judgment are hereby deleted and the Orders therein are set aside;


page 855


     (b)Paragraph 3 of the Judgment shall read:
     ""THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the Respondent, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, be and hereby is restrained from broadcasting the program ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" to the Province of Ontario and by the television station CBMT-TV in Montreal until the completion of the four criminal trials of the four applicants but not extending to any appeals therefrom.""
     2.THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that in all other respects the appeals of the Appellants be and hereby are dismissed.
     Dubin C.J.O. for the court noted that it was the common law courts that first recognized the importance of freedom of expression and the crucial role of the press in informing the public in a free and democratic society.  It was also the common law courts that first recognized, as a fundamental legal right, the right of an accused to a fair trial and the right of public access to their proceedings. Dubin C.J.O. indicated, however, that where there was a conflict between the two values, the courts had persistently held that the right to a fair trial is paramount (Steiner v. Toronto Star Ltd., [1956] O.R. 14 (H.C.), and R. v. Begley (1982), 38 O.R. (2d) 549 (H.C.)). Since the two values have been given constitutional status with the enactment of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the courts have again struck a balance between the two values and have held that the right to a fair trial must be given priority over freedom of the press (Fraser v. Public Service Staff Relations Board, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455).
     After referring to the unique circumstances of the case at bar, Dubin C.J.O. concluded at pp. 247-48 that:

The risk of denying the respondents a fair trial far outweighs any inconvenience which the appellant, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, may suffer by not airing the film when it proposed to do so.  No pressing need was shown why the film had to be aired before the conclusion of the four trials.  The film will still be timely when it is shown at a later date and the interests of  


page 856

justice dictate postponing its airing rather than running the risk attendant upon showing it at the time proposed.
     In order to assure the four respondents a fair trial, the learned motions court judge had a broad discretion and I cannot say that she erred in the exercise of her discretion in directing that the airing of the film be postponed.
     However, I think, with respect, that she erred in directing that the airing of the film be postponed throughout Canada and should have limited the postponement of the showing of the film to the Province of Ontario and the appellant's television station in Montreal, the signal of which reached L'Orignal.
     I also think the motions court judge erred by prohibiting the publishing in any media of any information relating to the proposed broadcast of the program until the completion of the criminal trials of the four respondents, as well as banning publication of the fact of the proceedings before her.
     III. Analysis
     A. Introduction
     This case turns in part on the issue of jurisdiction -- what court(s) have jurisdiction to hear a third party challenge to a publication ban order sought by the Crown and/or the defendant(s) in a criminal proceeding and made by a provincial or superior court judge under his or her common law or legislated discretionary authority?  This case also turns in part on the issue of publication bans -- on what grounds should a publication ban be ordered by a judge under his or her discretionary authority and on what grounds should it be altered or set aside by a higher court?

I should note in passing that, for the sake of convenience, I use the expression ""publication ban"" throughout my reasons to denote a ban on publishing in print and/or broadcasting on television, film, or radio.  I should also note that I will be discussing publication bans issued under common law or legislated discretionary authority and will  


page 857

not be discussing publication bans required by common law or statute.
     B. Jurisdiction
     (1) General Principles
     In cases involving publication bans issued in the context of criminal proceedings, the Crown and the accused have established avenues to follow when seeking or challenging a ban.  These avenues are consistent with and informed by the common law principle against interlocutory appeals in criminal matters (see McIntyre J.'s reasons in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p. 959, and R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764, at p. 1774).  To seek a ban under a judge's common law or legislated discretionary authority, the Crown and/or the accused should ask for a ban pursuant to that authority.  This request should be made to the trial judge (if one has been appointed) or to a judge in the court at the level the case will be heard (if the level of court can be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions such as ss. 468 , 469 , 553 , 555 , 798  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and s. 5  of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1 ).  If the level of court has not been established and cannot be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions, then the request should be made to a superior court judge (i.e., it should be made to the highest court that could hear the case, in order to avoid later having a superior court judge bound by an order made by a provincial court judge).  To seek or challenge a ban on appeal, the Crown and the accused should follow the regular avenues of appeal available to them through the Criminal Code  (Parts XXI and XXVI).
     It has been argued before this Court that third parties (specifically, the media) have a range of possible avenues open to them to appeal publication bans.  These include: criminal procedures; s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.  


page 858

S-26; civil procedures; extraordinary remedies; and s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  I have considered each of these in turn and conclude that the extraordinary remedy of certiorari should be used for bans ordered by provincial court judges and that s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act should be used for bans ordered by superior court judges.
     I should note at the outset that none of these avenues is absolutely satisfactory.  I am forced to choose the least unsatisfactory of a set of unsatisfactory options.  I offer the following overview of each of the possible avenues in an effort to convey to all the jurisdictional difficulties confronting the courts as well as the Bar and in the hope that my doing so will prompt Parliament to rectify this situation by enacting legislation that provides for a right of appeal for third parties (usually the media) seeking to challenge publication bans ordered by judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority.
     (i) Criminal Code 
     Section 674  of the Criminal Code  provides that:

674.  No proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXVI shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences.
     Parts XXI and XXVI do not authorize any proceedings through which the media can challenge a ban.  Therefore, there is no direct appeal available to the media through the Criminal Code .
     (ii) Supreme Court Act
     While on a literal reading, s. 674  of the Criminal Code  could be taken as excluding any resort to s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act ""in respect of indictable offences"", such literal interpretation cannot be adopted, given the legislative history and purpose of these provisions.


page 859


     What is now s. 674  was first enacted in 1892 to abolish the writ of error:  Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 743.  This was part of the transition from a system for review employing such procedures as the case reserved by the trial judge, the prerogative writs and the writ of error to the current approach of a statutorily mandated system of appeals.  The purpose of s. 743 and its successors was to make clear that the new statutory appeals were a substitute for, not in addition to, the former procedure in error.
     Section 40  of the Supreme Court Act has as its object the conferral upon the Supreme Court of Canada of comprehensive jurisdiction in federal and provincial laws.  As Pigeon J. expressed it in Hill v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827, at p. 850:

Section 41 [now s. 40] was enacted substantially in its present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council were being abolished and this court was being made truly supreme.  The Privy Council had enjoyed unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent that the new provision was intended to effect the change from a limited specific jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction.  To hold that the inconsistencies resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of leaving some wide gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted.  On the contrary, the enactment of a provision that undoubtedly confers some jurisdiction in criminal matters beyond that existing under the Criminal Code , clearly indicates Parliament's will to remedy the omission to extend the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council's jurisdiction in such cases was effectively abolished after the Statute of Westminster.
     This reasoning was cited with approval and relied upon by a majority of this Court in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368.  I note as well that in R. v. Barnes, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, in which a majority found that the Court did not have jurisdiction, such jurisdiction was excluded by s. 40(3) of the Supreme Court Act, not s. 674 of the Code.
     Section 40  of the Supreme Court Act contains its own limiting provision in s. 40(3).  That subsection  


page 860

excludes the granting of leave under s. 40(1)  from a judgment ""acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence"".  However, s. 40(3) does not prevent this Court from granting leave under s. 40(1)  to consider questions of criminal law not excluded by s. 40(3) such as those arising in the sentencing process as in Gardiner, supra, and those arising from the provisions in the Criminal Code  authorizing the review of the parole eligibility date for those convicted of high treason and first or second degree murder as in R. v. Vaillancourt (1990), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 384 (S.C.C.), and R. v. Swietlinski, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 481.
     For these reasons, I find that s. 674  of the Criminal Code  does not limit our jurisdiction to grant leave in cases such as this under s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act.
     At first glance, s. 40(3)  of the Supreme Court Act might also appear to preclude an appeal to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act.  Section 40(3)  states that:
     40. . . .

(3) No appeal to the Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.
     However, an appeal against an order issuing a publication ban is not an appeal from a judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence.  Therefore, it is not precluded by s. 40(3).


page 861


     Section 40(1)  states that:
     40. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal or of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court, where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its public importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed law and fact involved in that question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from that judgment is accordingly granted by the Supreme Court.
     A publication ban order can be seen as a final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province or a judge thereof in which judgment can be had in the particular case.  Therefore, the Supreme Court of Canada may grant leave to appeal under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act.
     The advantage of this avenue is that it uses established procedures and is not inconsistent with previous Supreme Court of Canada case law.  This may be thought to be problematic on the grounds that it is expensive and time-consuming.  However, a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada can be faster than an appeal to most courts of appeal in the country.  In addition, it is less expensive to come directly to the Supreme Court of Canada than it is to go through a court of appeal before getting to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Concerns about cost and delay are, therefore, misplaced.
     This avenue is problematic in so far as it provides for an appeal only by leave of the Supreme Court of Canada.  It therefore does not provide optimal protection for important rights (e.g., freedom of expression).  It also could result in an increased number of applications for leave coming before this Court and an increased number of cases  


page 862

needing to be heard by this Court -- all cases involving individuals charged with indictable offences and publication bans made by superior court judges could potentially seek leave and, depending upon the length and breadth of the bans, a number of these applications could raise issues of national importance (significant publication bans arguably go beyond the interest of the immediate litigants to the interests of Canadians generally).

However, despite the difficulties, I find that this is the least unsatisfactory avenue and I therefore adopt it for third party challenges to publication ban orders made by superior court judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority in the context of criminal proceedings.
     Some concern was voiced that this appeal could lead to appeals brought directly to this Court by witnesses at criminal trials. There is no need for such concern.  The problem for a witness most frequently arises out of a citation for contempt for refusal to testify.  It is true that pursuant to s. 9  of the Criminal Code  a judge may cite persons, including witnesses, for contempt of court.  Yet s. 10 of the Code sets out the procedure for bringing a conviction for contempt before a court of appeal. This decision will not change or affect that statutory procedure and right of appeal.
     (iii) Civil
     Provincial Judicature Acts provide for appellate jurisdiction over civil matters.  For example, according to s. 6 of the Ontario Courts of Justice Act:


page 863


     6. -- (1)  An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from,
     (a)an order of the Divisional Court, on a question that is not a question of fact alone, with leave as provided in the rules of court;
     (b)a final order of a judge of the Ontario Court (General Division), except an order referred to in clause 19(1)(a) [certain claims involving not more than $25,000 exclusive of costs];
     (c)a certificate of assessment of costs issued in a proceeding in the Court of Appeal, on an issue in respect of which an objection was served under the rules of court.

(2) The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal that lies to the Divisional Court or the Ontario Court (General Division) if an appeal in the same proceeding lies to and is taken to the Court of Appeal.
     (3) The Court of Appeal may, on motion, transfer an appeal that has already been commenced in the Divisional Court or the Ontario Court (General Division) to the Court of Appeal for the purpose of subsection (2).
     If an application challenging an order banning publication is characterized as a criminal matter, then the Judicature Acts do not provide jurisdiction.  If it is characterized as a civil matter, then it may be argued that these Acts do provide jurisdiction.
     This avenue has the advantage that it uses established procedures.  Furthermore, it has intuitive appeal to those who think that the object of an application by the media is a civil remedy which affects a civil right (the right of the media to free speech).  Nevertheless, I reject this avenue.
     First, it is important to keep in mind what La Forest J. said in Kourtessis v. M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, at p. 80:
     The admixture of provincial civil procedure with criminal procedure could, I fear, result in an unpredictable mish-mash where, in applying federal procedural law, one would forever be looking over one's shoulder to see what procedure the provinces have adopted (and this may differ from province to province) to see if there was something there that one judge or another would  


page 864

like to add if he or she found the federal law inadequate.  And I see no reason in principle why appeals could not be read in for other interlocutory proceedings, or indeed why other provincial rules of procedure might not be adopted, as was attempted in Lafleur.  That, barring federal adoption, is in my view constitutionally unacceptable.  It is certainly impractical.  In dealing with procedure, and particularly criminal procedure, it is important to know what one should do next.  That is why, no doubt, Parliament adopted a comprehensive procedure under the Criminal Code ....
     Second, we are dealing here with media challenges to publication bans ordered by judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority in response to a request for a ban made by the Crown and/or by individuals charged (or at risk of being charged) with criminal offences.  Such challenges are criminal matters, not civil ones.
     Third, Judicature Acts cannot be used to provide jurisdiction to review publication ban orders of provincial court judges because with limited exceptions, provincial court judges (in all provinces except Quebec) can only exercise criminal jurisdiction and so such orders made by them cannot be characterized as civil matters.  Judicature Acts cannot be used to provide jurisdiction to review publication ban orders of superior court judges because it is not desirable to have a situation in which essentially the same order made for the same purposes affecting the same rights can be characterized as civil when it is made by a superior court judge but must be characterized as criminal when it is made by a provincial court judge.
     (iv) Extraordinary Remedies
     Provincial superior courts have jurisdiction to hear applications for the extraordinary remedy of  


page 865

certiorari against provincial court judges for excesses of jurisdiction and for errors of law on the face of the record.  As I will explain in Part C of these reasons, the common law rule governing the issuance of orders banning publication must be consistent with the principles of the Charter . Since the common law rule does not authorize publication bans that limit Charter  rights in an unjustifiable manner, an order implementing such a publication ban is an error of law on the face of the record.  Therefore, if a publication ban order is made by a provincial court judge, the media can apply to the superior court for certiorari and argue that the ban is not authorized by the common law rule.  If this is the case, the ban will then constitute an error of law on the face of the record.  By virtue of s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code , an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from a decision granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by way of certiorari.
     This avenue uses established procedures and is not inconsistent with previous Supreme Court of Canada case law.  In addition, the certiorari avenue provides for appeals (through s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code ).  It therefore avoids the undesirable situations of: (a) important rights being left without the protection of review and appeal; and (b) an increased number of leave applications being made to this Court and cases needing to be heard by this Court.
     The most important problem with this avenue is that, at common law, certiorari does not lie against a decision of a superior court judge.  In Kourtessis, supra, at p. 90, the possibility that certiorari might lie against a superior court judge was left open by some members of this Court.  However, I am not willing to adopt an avenue that requires that one superior court judge review the decision of another superior court judge.   Therefore, this avenue is available against a provincial court judge but not against a superior court judge.  The following odd situation thus results: essentially the same order  


page 866

made for the same purposes affecting the same rights (of the defendant, the Crown, and the media) will be subject to different avenues of review and appeal depending upon whether the order is made by a superior court judge or a provincial court judge.
     Another problem with this avenue comes from the apparently limited remedial powers of certiorari.  Traditionally, certiorari has been limited remedially.  That is it could only be used to quash an order.  Thus, if the media were seeking an additional or alternative remedy, the desired remedy would appear to be unavailable through certiorari.
     However, it is open to this Court to enlarge the remedial powers of certiorari and I do so now for limited circumstances.  Given that the common law rule authorizing publication bans must be consistent with Charter  principles, I am of the view that the remedies available where a judge errs in applying this rule should be consistent with the remedial powers under the Charter .  Therefore, the remedial powers of certiorari should be expanded to include the remedies that are available through s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  It should be emphatically noted that it is not necessary in this case for this Court to decide whether or not the Charter  applies directly to court orders.  I am simply saying that when a judge exceeds his authority under the common law rule governing publication bans, then the remedies available through a certiorari challenge to the judge's action should be the same as the remedies that would be available under the Charter .
     Despite the difficulties with this avenue, I find that it is the least unsatisfactory avenue and I therefore adopt it for third party challenges to publication ban orders made by provincial court  


page 867

judges under their discretionary authority in the context of criminal proceedings.

(v) Charter 
     Section 24(1)  of the Charter  provides that:
     24.  (1)  Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter , have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
     I wrote about s. 24(1)  in Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 196:
     When a person can demonstrate that one of his Charter  rights has been infringed, access to a court of competent jurisdiction to seek a remedy is essential for the vindication of a constitutional wrong.  To create a right without a remedy is antithetical to one of the purposes of the Charter  which surely is to allow courts to fashion remedies when constitutional infringements occur.
     However, in Mills, supra, at p. 971, La Forest J. wrote:
     It should be obvious from the foregoing remarks that I am sympathetic to the view that Charter  remedies should, in general, be accorded within the normal procedural context in which an issue arises.  I do not believe s. 24  of the Charter  requires the wholesale invention of a parallel system for the administration of Charter  rights over and above the machinery already available for the administration of justice.
     If a challenge to a publication ban could not be framed in terms of an error of law, then the certiorari and Supreme Court Act avenues might be unavailable and s. 24(1)  might therefore be available.  However, since a challenge to a publication ban ordered by a judge under his or her common law or legislated discretionary authority can be framed in terms of an error of law, the certiorari and Supreme Court Act avenues are available and therefore we need not here decide the issue of the application of the Charter , to publication bans  


page 868

ordered by judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority in particular, and to court orders in general.
     (2) General Guidelines for Practice
     (i) Preliminary Comments
     I have three preliminary comments to make before proceeding with general guidelines for practice with regard to publication bans issued under a judge's common law or legislated discretionary authority.
     First, in a jury trial, a motion for a publication ban must be heard in the absence of the jury.  Consider, for example, a case in which the media propose to broadcast information that would be inadmissible as evidence in the normal course of the criminal trial.  The accused will have to introduce this information into evidence in order to demonstrate the risk to a fair trial.  And yet, if the risk is demonstrated and substantial, the jury should not hear this evidence.  The accused must not be placed in the intolerable position of having to present the inadmissible information before the jury in an attempt to secure an impartial jury.  Consider also, a case in which the media propose to broadcast information that would undercut a particular defence strategy.  The accused will have to reveal his or her defence strategy in order to demonstrate the risk to a fair trial.  And yet, it would be unfair to require the defence to reveal defence strategy prior to the closing of the Crown's case -- the accused must not be placed in the position of having to risk prejudice to one aspect of his or her right to a fair trial in order to protect another aspect of this right.
     Second, the issue of giving notice to the media of motions for publication bans may appear to raise a number of practical problems.  Which media are to be given notice, and how is such notice to be given?  Do the media include all newspapers, television stations, and radio stations potentially affected by the ban?  How is notice to be served?   


page 869

Given that I have concluded that motions for publication bans made in the context of criminal proceedings are criminal in nature, the solution to these practical problems is to be found in the provincial rules of criminal procedure and the relevant case law.  For example, Rule 6.04(1) of the Ontario Court of Justice Criminal Proceedings Rules, SI/92-99, states that:
     6.04 (1) The notice of application shall be served on all parties and, where there is uncertainty whether anyone else should be served, the applicant may make a motion without notice to a judge for an order for directions.
     The judge hearing the application thus has the discretion to direct that third parties (e.g., the media) be given notice.  Exactly who is to be given notice and how notice is to be given should remain in the discretion of the judge to be exercised in accordance with the provincial rules of criminal procedure and the relevant case law.
     Third, the issue of standing may also appear to raise problems.  Which members of the media are to be given standing?  Does standing include standing to do any or all of the following: cross-examine witnesses, call viva voce evidence, file affidavit evidence, and present oral and/or written arguments?  Again, given that I have concluded that motions for publication bans made in the context of criminal proceedings are criminal in nature, the solution to these practical problems is to be found in the provincial rules of criminal procedure and the relevant case law.  The judge hearing the application thus has the discretion to grant standing to interested third parties (e.g., the media) and this standing can include any or all of the activities listed above.
     I now proceed with some general guidelines for practice for the Crown, the accused, the media, and the courts in turn.


page 870


     (ii) For the Crown and the Accused
     To get a publication ban issued under a judge's common law or legislated discretionary authority, the Crown and/or the accused should make a motion for a ban pursuant to that authority.  This motion should be made before the trial judge (if one has been appointed) or before a judge in the court at the level the case will be heard (if the level of court can be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions such as ss. 468 , 469 , 553 , 555  and 798  of the Criminal Code  and s. 5 of the Young Offenders Act).  If the level of court has not been established and cannot be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions, then the motion should be made before a superior court judge (i.e., it should be made before the highest court that could hear the case, in order to avoid later having a superior court judge bound by an order made by a provincial court judge).  To seek or challenge a ban on appeal, the Crown and the accused should follow the regular avenues of appeal available to them through the Criminal Code  (Parts XXI and XXVI).

A complication arises, however, when the initial order is made by a judge other than the trial judge (i.e., in cases where a trial judge has not yet been appointed).  In this situation, neither the accused nor the Crown could ordinarily attack the initial order, either at trial or through the regular routes of appeal, without running afoul of the ""rule against collateral attack"": Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, and Meltzer, supra. This rule states that a court order may not be attacked ""in proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order or judgment"" (Wilson, supra, per McIntyre J., at p. 599).  Since the specific object of the trial is not the reversal or variation of the initial publication ban, the rule against collateral attacks would, if strictly applied, prevent a reconsideration of the initial order by the trial judge and, by extension, a review of the order by the appellate courts under the normal routes of appeal (since the jurisdiction of the  


page 871

appellate courts is restricted to errors of law made at trial).
     In R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, a majority of this Court noted that the rule against collateral attacks is ""not intended to immunize court orders from review"" (per Iacobucci J., at p. 349), and held that in situations where the purposes underlying the rule are not engaged, some flexibility in the rule's application should be recognized.  Iacobucci J., writing for the majority, discussed the rationale for the rule in the following terms (at p. 349):
     The rationale behind the rule is powerful: the rule seeks to maintain the rule of law and to preserve the repute of the administration of justice.  To allow parties to govern their affairs according to their perception of matters such as the jurisdiction of the court issuing the order would result in uncertainty.  Further, ""the orderly and functional administration of justice"" requires that court orders be considered final and binding unless they are reversed on appeal (R. v. Pastro [(1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 485], at p. 497).

He continued, however, by observing that the order in question in the case before him (a pre-trial division and severance order made by a judge other than the trial judge) would have been reviewable on appeal had it been made by the trial judge.  He stated (at p. 350):
     To permit an order to stand which is so erroneous that it results in a trial process that is fundamentally flawed would result in procedure governing substance; a result that cannot be accepted.
     Although Litchfield involved orders of a different nature than the publication bans under consideration here, I am of the view that it is similarly appropriate to recognize some flexibility in the rule against collateral attacks when what is at issue is a publication ban.


page 872


     This problem does not, of course, arise in the case at bar, so it is unnecessary to consider the matter further at this time.  I have mentioned it here simply to highlight the fact that none of the avenues of appeal currently available is entirely satisfactory.  As I noted earlier, until Parliament acts to rectify the situation by enacting appropriate legislation I am forced to choose the least unsatisfactory of a number of unsatisfactory alternatives.
     (iii) For the Media
     If the media wish to oppose a motion for a ban brought in provincial court, they should attend at the hearing on the motion, argue to be given status, and if given status, participate in the motion.  To challenge a ban once ordered, the media should make an application for certiorari to a superior court judge.  To challenge a denial of certiorari, the media should appeal the superior court judge's decision to the Court of Appeal under s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  To challenge a dismissal of an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the media should make an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act.
     If the media wish to oppose a motion for a ban brought in a provincial superior court, then they should attend at the hearing on the motion, argue to be given status, and, if given status, participate in the motion.  To challenge a ban once ordered, the media should make an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act.
     (iv) For the Court
     Upon a motion for a ban under the common law rule, the court should give standing to the media who seek standing (according to the rules of criminal procedure and the established common law principles) and follow the general guidelines for practice set out in Part C of these reasons.


page 873


     (3) Application of Principles and Practice to the Case at Bar
     (i) The Facts
     All of the cases were being heard or were scheduled to be heard in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) before a judge and jury.  All of the accused were pre-tried with no prospect of resolution.  Dagenais was in week five of his trial.  The jury was to be charged three days following the motion for the ban.  Monette already had his trial judge named (Cusson J.).  His trial was to run from February 1 to February 26, 1993.  Radford's trial was to run from April 5 to May 4, 1993.  Dugas' trial was to begin some time between May 31 and July 2, 1993.
     (ii) The Application of the Law to these Facts
     Dagenais should have gone to his trial judge.  If the ban had been refused, he would have had no right of appeal beyond his normal right to appeal if convicted at the end of the trial.
     Monette should also have gone to his trial judge.  If the ban had been refused, he would have had no right of appeal beyond his normal right to appeal if convicted at the end of the trial.
     Radford and Dugas, however, were correct to go to a provincial superior court judge.  If the ban had been refused, they would have had no right of appeal beyond their normal right to appeal if convicted at the end of the trials.
     When the publication ban order was given, the CBC should have sought leave to appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act.
     (iii) Conclusions about Jurisdiction
     Gotlib J. did not have jurisdiction to hear the motions from Dagenais or Monette, but she did  


page 874

have jurisdiction to hear the motions from Radford and Dugas.  The Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear from the CBC  This Court had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal the Court of Appeal decision and to draw these conclusions on the issue of jurisdiction.
     The Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act to grant leave to appeal Gotlib J.'s order.  However, the CBC did not seek leave to appeal Gotlib J.'s order.  It would therefore appear at first glance that the Supreme Court of Canada does not have jurisdiction to rule on the order itself.  However, I have decided to grant leave to appeal Gotlib J.'s order under s. 40  proprio motu, nunc pro tunc, ex post facto (of its own motion, now as of the previous date, for something done after).  I do this because I believe that it would be unfair to penalize the CBC for not following the correct procedure where the correct procedure was not known until we decided this case.  I also do this because the issue of publication bans is of national importance, the case was fully argued before us, and no one is prejudiced by the granting of leave.
     It is important to note once more that the current situation is deplorable.  Fundamental rights are at stake, but no truly satisfactory avenue of appeal has been established by statute.  I hope that Parliament will soon consider filling this jurisdictional lacuna and establishing statutory rights of appeal for third parties such as the media.
     C. Publication Bans
     (1) The Analytical Approach
     Challenges to publication bans may be framed in several different ways, depending on the nature of the objection to the ban.  If legislation requires a judge to order a publication ban, then any objection to that ban should be framed as a Charter  challenge to the legislation itself.  Similarly, if a common law rule requires a judge to order a publication ban or authorizes a judge to order a  


page 875

publication ban that infringes Charter  rights in a manner not reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, then any objection to that ban should be framed as a Charter  challenge to the common law rule.
     In the case at bar, we are dealing with a common law rule which provides judges with the discretion to order a publication ban in certain circumstances.  Discretion cannot be open-ended.  It cannot be exercised arbitrarily.  More to the point, as I stated in Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078, in the context of legislative conferrals of discretion:
     As the Constitution is the supreme law of Canada and any law that is inconsistent with its provisions is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect, it is impossible to interpret legislation conferring discretion as conferring a power to infringe the Charter , unless, of course, that power is expressly conferred or necessarily implied.  Such an interpretation would require us to declare the legislation to be of no force or effect, unless it could be justified under s. 1 .
     I would extend this reasoning, and hold that a common law rule conferring discretion cannot confer the power to infringe the Charter .  Discretion must be exercised within the boundaries set by the principles of the Charter ; exceeding these boundaries results in a reversible error of law.  In this case, then, we are dealing with an error of law challenge to a publication ban imposed under a common law discretionary rule.
     The common law rule governing publication bans has been traditionally understood as requiring those seeking a ban to demonstrate that there is a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial.  This rule accorded some protection to freedom of expression, in so far as it prevented publication bans from being imposed for no  


page 876

reason, or in response to merely speculative concerns.  The question that must be addressed, however, is whether the rule provides sufficient protection for freedom of expression in the context of post-Charter Canadian society.  As Iacobucci J., speaking for the Court, stated in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 675:
     Where the principles underlying a common law rule are out of step with the values enshrined in the Charter , the courts should scrutinize the rule closely.  If it is possible to change the common law rule so as to make it consistent with Charter  values . . . then the rule ought to be changed.
     Like the right of an accused to a fair trial, a fundamental principle of our justice system which is now expressly protected by s. 11 (d) of the Charter , freedom of expression, including freedom of the press, is now recognized as a paramount value in Canadian society, as demonstrated by its enshrinement as a constitutionally protected right in s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  Section 2 (b) guarantees the rights of all Canadians to ""freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication"".  The importance of the s. 2 (b) freedoms has been recognized by this Court on numerous occasions (see, for example, RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573; Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 712; Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927; Rocket v. Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 232; R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697; and R. v. Zundel, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731).
     As I said, for the Court, in Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 129:
     Freedom of the press is indeed an important and essential attribute of a free and democratic society, and measures which prohibit the media from publishing information deemed of interest obviously restrict that freedom.


page 877


     Similarly, in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, Cory J. remarked (at pp. 1336-37):
     It is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society than freedom of expression.  Indeed a democracy cannot exist without that freedom to express new ideas and to put forward opinions about the functioning of public institutions.  The concept of free and uninhibited speech permeates all truly democratic societies and institutions.  The vital importance of the concept cannot be over-emphasized.
     . . .
     . . . The principle of freedom of speech and expression has been firmly accepted as a necessary feature of modern democracy.
     In Zundel, supra, at p. 752, McLachlin J. distilled the commentary and case law on the subject of freedom of expression, and declared that the interests protected by s. 2 (b) are ""truth, political or social participation, and self-fulfilment"".
     The pre-Charter  common law rule governing publication bans emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban.  In my view, the balance this  rule strikes is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter , and in particular, the equal status given by the Charter  to ss. 2 (b) and 11 (d).  It would be inappropriate for the courts to continue to apply a common law rule that automatically favoured the rights protected by s. 11 (d) over those protected by s. 2 (b).  A hierarchical approach to rights, which places some over others, must be avoided, both when interpreting the Charter  and when developing the common law.  When the protected rights of two individuals come into conflict, as can occur in the case of publication bans, Charter  principles require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance of both sets of rights.


page 878


     It is open to this Court to ""develop the principles of the common law in a manner consistent with the fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution"": Dolphin Delivery, supra, at p. 603 (per McIntyre J.).  I am, therefore, of the view that it is necessary to reformulate the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans in a manner that reflects the principles of the Charter .  Given that publication bans, by their very definition, curtail the freedom of expression of third parties, I believe that the common law rule must be adapted so as to require a consideration both of the objectives of a publication ban, and the proportionality of the ban to its effect on protected Charter  rights.  The modified rule may be stated as follows:
     A publication ban should only be ordered when:
     (a)  Such a ban is necessary in order to prevent a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, because reasonably available alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and
     (b) The salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of those affected by the ban.
     If the ban fails to meet this standard (which clearly reflects the substance of the Oakes test applicable when assessing legislation under s. 1  of the Charter ), then, in making the order, the judge committed an error of law and the challenge to the order on this basis should be successful.
     (2) The Application of the Analytical Approach to the Case at Bar
     To assess the validity of the order in the case at bar, it is necessary to consider the objective of the order, to examine the availability of reasonable alternative measures that could achieve this objective, and to consider whether the salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the deleterious impact the ban has on freedom of expression.  If the publication ban in question cannot be justified under the common law rule set out above, then, in  


page 879

making her order, Gotlib J. committed an error of law.
     The objective of the ban ordered in the case at bar was the diminution of the risk that the trial of the four accused persons might be rendered unfair by adverse pre-trial publicity.  This objective reflects the interest that the accused persons shared with both the public and the courts in ensuring both that a trial be held and that it be fair.  The interest that Dagenais, Monette, Radford and Dugas have in receiving a fair trial is of such importance that it has been entrenched as a constitutional right, in both ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  In addition to the accused's interest in the fairness of their trial, the public had an interest in their being acquitted or convicted through trials that were fair and that had the appearance of fairness: R. v. Généreux, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, at p. 283.  Similarly, the courts had an interest in ensuring that justice was done, and an interest in safeguarding the repute of the administration of justice by ensuring that justice was seen to be done.
     In most cases where publication bans are sought, including the case at bar, attention is focused on a particular potential source of trial unfairness -- the possibility that adverse pre-trial publicity might make it difficult or impossible to find an impartial jury.  In Généreux, supra, in the context of a discussion of s. 11 (d), I noted (at pp. 282-83):
     [One of s. 11 (d)'s objectives is] to ensure that a person is tried by a tribunal that is not biased in any way and is in a position to render a decision which is based solely on the merits of the case before it, according to law.  The decision-maker should not be influenced by the parties to a case or by outside forces except to the extent that he or she is persuaded by submissions and arguments pertaining to the legal issues in dispute.
     It must be noted, however, that while the Charter  provides safeguards both against actual instances of bias and against situations that give rise to a serious risk of a jury's impartiality being tainted, it does not require that all conceivable steps be taken to remove even the most speculative risks.  As I noted in R. v. Lippé, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, at p.  


page 880

142, ""the Constitution does not always guarantee the `ideal'"".  This must be borne in mind when the objective of a publication ban imposed under the common law rule is specified, since one of the primary purposes of the common law rule is the protection of the constitutional rights of the accused.  As the rule itself states, the objective of a publication ban authorized under the rule is to prevent real and substantial risks of trial unfairness -- publication bans are not available as protection against remote and speculative dangers.
     It is also important to note the extent to which a publication ban trenches upon the rights of individuals to freedom of expression.  In the case of the publication ban at issue here, the specific freedom of expression interests engaged by the ban included:  the film director's interest in expressing himself; the CBC's interest in broadcasting the film; the public's interest in viewing the film; and society's interest in having the important issue of child abuse presented to the public.  All of these interests were limited by the publication ban ordered in the case at bar.
     In my view, the publication ban in the case at bar was clearly directed towards preventing a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial of the four accused.  What must next be considered in order to determine whether the ban was supportable under the common law rule was whether a publication ban was necessary on the facts of this case.  This requires a consideration of whether reasonable alternative measures were available that would have guarded against the risk of the trial being unfair without circumscribing the expressive rights of third parties.  As I will explain, I do not consider it necessary in the case at bar to consider the question of whether the salutary effects of the publication ban outweighed the deleterious impact the ban had on freedom of expression, because I find that there were, in fact, reasonable alternative measures available.
     The publication ban in the case at bar would have passed the first stage of analysis under the  


page 881

common law rule  if: (1) the ban was as narrowly circumscribed as possible (while still serving the objectives); and (2) there were no other effective means available to achieve the objectives.  However, the initial ban in the case at bar was far too broad.  It prohibited broadcast throughout Canada and even banned reporting on the ban itself.  In addition, there were other effective means available to achieve the objectives.  The publication ban ordered by Gotlib J. has, in fact, expired, making it unnecessary to discuss in great detail the particular alternative measures that were available in the case at bar.  Possibilities that readily come to mind, however, include adjourning trials, changing venues, sequestering jurors, allowing challenges for cause and voir dires during jury selection, and providing strong judicial direction to the jury. Sequestration and judicial direction were available for the Dagenais jury.  Apart from sequestration, all of the other effective alternatives to bans were available for the other three accused.  For this reason, the publication ban imposed in the case at bar cannot be supported under the common law.  As a result,  in purporting to order the ban under her common law discretionary authority, Gotlib J. committed an error of law.
     (3) Some General Comments About Publication Bans
     Before concluding, I would like to make some general comments about publication bans issued under the common law rule.  First, I believe that it is important to recognize that publication bans should not always be seen as a clash between two titans -- freedom of expression for the media versus the right to a fair trial for the accused.  Second, I have some concerns about the efficacy of some publication bans.  Useful discussions of some of the issues that I raise in this section can be found in A. M. Linden, ""Limitations on Media Coverage of Legal Proceedings: A Critique and Some Proposals for Reform"", in P. Anisman and A. M. Linden, eds., The Media, the Courts and the Charter (1986), 301; M. D. Lepofsky, Open Justice: The Constitutional Right to Attend and Speak About Criminal Proceedings (1985); and the Law Reform  


page 882

Commission of Canada, Working Paper 56, Public and Media Access to the Criminal Process (1987).
     (i) Rejecting the Clash Model
     There are at least three reasons for rejecting the clash model.  First, it is more suited to American than to Canadian jurisprudence, since the American Constitution has no equivalent of s. 1 of our Charter , which, as I discussed earlier, is also a source of the fundamental principles informing the development of the common law in Canada.
     Second, it is not the case that freedom of expression and the accused's right to a fair trial are always in conflict.  Sometimes publicity serves important interests in the fair trial process.  For example, in the context of publication bans connected to criminal proceedings, these interests include the accused's interest in public scrutiny of the court process, and all of the participants in the court process.
     Third, the analysis of publication bans should be much richer than the clash model suggests.  Rather than simply focusing on the fact that bans always limit freedom of expression and usually aim to protect the right to a fair trial of the accused, it should be recognized that ordering bans may:
     - limit freedom of expression (and thus undercut the purposes of s. 2 (b) discussed above);
     - prevent the jury from being influenced by information other than that presented in evidence during the trial (for example, information presented in a tabloid television show and evidence discussed in the absence of the jury and held to be inadmissible);


page 883


     - maximize the chances that witnesses will testify because they will not be fearful of the consequences of publicity;
     - protect vulnerable witnesses (for example, child witnesses, police informants, and victims of sexual offences);
     - preserve the privacy of individuals involved in the criminal process (for example, the accused and his or her family as well as the victims and the witnesses and their families);
     - maximize the chances of rehabilitation for ""young offenders"";
     - encourage the reporting of sexual offences;

- save the financial and/or emotional costs to the state, the accused, the victims, and witnesses of the alternatives to publication bans (for example, delaying trials, changing venues, and challenging jurors for cause); and
     - protect national security.
     It should also be recognized that not ordering bans may:
     - maximize the chances of individuals with relevant information hearing about a case and coming forward with new information;
     - prevent perjury by placing witnesses under public scrutiny;
     - prevent state and/or court wrongdoing by placing the criminal justice process under public scrutiny;
     - reduce crime through the public expression of disapproval for crime; and
     - promote the public discussion of important issues.
     These are intended to be illustrative rather than comprehensive lists of reasons for and against bans.  They are simply intended to illustrate the breadth of issues that deserve a place but are not often found in the analysis of the justification of  


page 884

particular publication bans.  These concerns have a place in each step of the analysis required under the common law rule outlined above -- they are relevant to the initial consideration of whether a ban is necessary to safeguard the fairness of a trial, to the question of whether reasonable alternatives are available, and to the issue of the balance struck between the salutary and deleterious effects of a publication ban.
     (ii) The Efficacy of Some Publication Bans
     There are several reasons to be concerned about the efficacy of some publication bans (i.e., bans aimed at preventing the jury from being influenced by information gathered outside the criminal proceedings).
     To begin, I doubt that jurors are always adversely influenced by publications.  There is no data available on this issue.  However, common sense dictates that in some cases jurors may be adversely affected.  Assuming this, I nevertheless believe that jurors are capable of following instructions from trial judges and ignoring information not presented to them in the course of the criminal proceedings.  As Lord Taylor C.J. wrote in Ex parte Telegraph Plc., [1993] 2 All E.R. 971 (C.A.), at p. 978:
     In determining whether publication of matter would cause a substantial risk of prejudice to a future trial, a court should credit the jury with the will and ability to abide by the judge's direction to decide the case only on the evidence before them.
     This Court has also made some strong statements about the reliability of juries.  In R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, Dickson C.J. wrote (at pp. 692-93):
     The very strength of the jury is that the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary citizens who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process a healthy measure of common sense.  The jury is, of course, bound to follow the law as it is explained by the trial judge.  Jury directions are often  


page 885

long and difficult, but the experience of trial judges is that juries do perform their duty according to the law. . . .
     It is of course, entirely possible to construct an argument disputing the theory of trial by jury.  Juries are capable of egregious mistakes and they may at times seem to be ill-adapted to the exigencies of an increasingly complicated and refined criminal law.  But until the paradigm is altered by Parliament, the Court should not be heard to call into question the capacity of juries to do the job assigned to them.  The ramifications of any such statement could be enormous.  Moreover, the fundamental right to a jury trial has recently been underscored by s. 11 (f) of the Charter .  If that right is so important, it is logically incoherent to hold that juries are incapable of following the explicit instructions of a judge. [Emphasis in original.]
     Corbett was about the issue of whether evidence of prior convictions could be presented to the jury given that such evidence has both proper and improper uses.  The case at bar is, in part, about the issue of whether juries are irremediably adversely influenced by publications.  However, the difference of issue is irrelevant here.  What matters is that this Court has strongly endorsed the ability of a jury to follow the explicit instructions of a judge.  This endorsement surely applies as much to the instruction to ignore all information not presented in the course of the criminal proceedings as it applies to the instruction to use evidence of prior convictions for one purpose and not another.  I am comforted in my extension of Corbett to the case at bar by R. v. Vermette, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 985, at pp. 993-94, in which La Forest J. wrote in the context of the impact of publicity that ""[t]his Court has recently had occasion to underline the confidence that may be had in the ability of a jury to disabuse itself of information that it is not entitled to consider; see R. v. Corbett"".
     These observations are particularly apt in a case, such as this, in which the publication ban relates to identifiable and finite sources of pre-trial publicity.   


page 886

More problematic is the situation in which there is a period of sustained pre-trial publicity concerning matters that will be the subject of the trial. In such circumstances, the effect of instructions is considerably lessened. Impressions may be created in the minds of the jury that cannot be consciously dispelled. The jury may at the end of the day be unable to separate the evidence in court from information that was implanted by a steady stream of publicity.
     It should also be noted that recent technological advances have brought with them considerable difficulties for those who seek to enforce bans.  The efficacy of bans has been reduced by the growth of interprovincial and international television and radio broadcasts available through cable television, satellite dishes, and shortwave radios.  It has also been reduced by the advent of information exchanges available through computer networks.  In this global electronic age, meaningfully restricting the flow of information is becoming increasingly difficult.  Therefore, the actual effect of bans on jury impartiality is substantially diminishing.
     These concerns about the efficacy of some publication bans fit into the analytical approach under the common law rule outlined previously at several stages, since it is necessary to consider how efficacious a publication ban will be before deciding whether a ban is necessary, whether alternative measures would be equally successful at controlling the risk of trial unfairness, and whether the salutary effects of the ban are outweighed by its negative impact on freedom of expression.
     If any adverse influence of a publication on jurors can be remedied by means short of banning the publication, then it might well be argued that there is no rational connection between the publication ban and the objective of preventing the jury from being adversely influenced by information other than that presented in evidence during the trial.  In such a case, it could not be asserted that a  


page 887

ban was necessary to protect the fairness of the trial.  I should note, however, that although it is possible that a publication ban will have a total absence of influence on the fairness of the trial,  such cases will be rare.  As a result, one will generally have to go further and consider the availability of reasonable alternative measures when assessing whether, in a given case, a publication ban was necessary.
     If the actual beneficial effects of publication bans are limited, then it might well be argued  in some cases that the negative impact the ban has on freedom of expression outweighs its useful effects.  The analysis that is required at this stage of the application of the common law rule is very similar to the third part of the second branch of the analysis required under s. 1  of the Charter , as set out by this Court in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103.  As Dickson C.J. stated in Oakes (at p. 140), ""[e]ven if an objective is of sufficient importance, and the first two elements of the proportionality test are satisfied, it is still possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it is intended to serve"".  In many instances, the imposition of a measure will result in the full, or nearly full, realization of the legislative objective.  In these situations, the third step of the proportionality test calls for an examination of the balance that has been struck between the objective in question and the deleterious effects on constitutionally protected rights arising from the means that have been employed to achieve this objective.  At other times, however, the measure at issue, while rationally connected to an important objective, will result in only the partial achievement of this object.  In such cases, I believe that the third step of the second branch of the Oakes test requires both that the underlying objective of a measure and the salutary effects that actually result from its implementation be proportional to the deleterious effects the measure has on fundamental rights and freedoms.  A legislative objective may be pressing and substantial, the means chosen may be rationally connected to that objective, and less rights-impairing alternatives may not be available.   


page 888

Nonetheless, even if the importance of the objective itself (when viewed in the abstract) outweighs the deleterious effects on protected rights, it is still possible that the actual salutary effects of the legislation will not be sufficient to justify these negative effects.
     While the third step of the Oakes proportionality test has often been expressed in terms of the proportionality of the objective to the deleterious effects,  this Court has recognized that in appropriate cases it is necessary to measure the actual salutary effects of impugned legislation against its deleterious effects, rather than merely considering the proportionality of the objective itself.  For example, in Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, Dickson C.J. (who characterized the objective of the impugned Criminal Code  solicitation provisions as the curtailment of the social nuisance caused by the public display of the sale of sex) applied the third step of the proportionality analysis by considering (at p. 1139) whether ""the obtrusiveness linked to the enforcement of the provision, when weighed against the resulting decrease in the social nuisance associated with street solicitation, can be justified in accordance with s. 1 "" (emphasis added).  In the same case, I noted that a factor to be considered in the third part of the second branch of the Oakes analysis was the fact that Parliament had taken steps to ensure that the effectiveness of the provision in question would be reviewed three years after its enactment.
     Similarly, in R. v. Hess, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, Wilson J. (writing for a majority of the Court) was of the view that while the imposition of absolute liability for the offence of having sexual intercourse with a female person under the age of 14 (in what was then s. 146(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34) was rationally connected to the pressing and substantial objective of protecting young girls from premature sexual intercourse, the measure nonetheless failed both the second and  


page 889

third parts of the second branch of Oakes, since ""[t]he potential benefits flowing from the retention of absolute liability are far too speculative to be able to justify a provision that envisages the possibility of life imprisonment for one who is mentally innocent"" (p. 926).
     In my view, characterizing the third part of the second branch of the Oakes test as being concerned solely with the balance between the objective and the deleterious effects of a measure rests on too narrow a conception of proportionality.  I believe that even if an objective is of sufficient importance, the first two elements of the proportionality test are satisfied, and the deleterious effects are proportional to the objectives, it is still possible that, because of a lack of proportionality between the deleterious effects and the salutary effects, a measure will not be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.  I would, therefore, rephrase the third part of the Oakes test as follows:  there must be a proportionality between the deleterious effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the rights or freedoms in question and the objective, and there must be a proportionality between the deleterious and the salutary effects of the measures.
     A similar view of proportionality must inform the common law rule governing publication bans (this is, of course, apparent from the way I have expressed the second part of the rule).  This suggests that when a ban has a serious deleterious effect on freedom of expression and has few salutary effects on the fairness of a trial, the ban will not be authorized at common law.
     It is also important to recognize, however, that the objective usually underlying such bans -- the diminution of the risk that a trial might be tainted by unfairness  -- is directly related to the accused's constitutionally protected right to a fair trial.  Although, as I noted earlier (at pp. 881-83), it is incorrect to oversimplify the relationship between the right to a fair trial and the right to freedom of  


page 890

expression by blindly applying the ""clash of rights"" model, there are times when the rights of the accused will be in direct conflict with the expressive rights of the media.  In such cases, I believe it is necessary to apply the common law proportionality analysis in a manner that reflects the fact that two fundamental rights are in jeopardy.  That is, it is essential in these circumstances to recognize that the pressing and substantial objective at issue is itself a fundamental right, and that, as such, it is a matter of exceptional importance.  This will be of particular significance when considering whether there are reasonable alternative measures available, and when assessing the balance between the salutary and deleterious effects of the ban.  When examining alternative measures, it will be important to carefully consider both rights at issue, so as to ensure that any alternative measures that impair free expression to a lesser degree than a publication ban also reasonably protect the right to a fair trial.  Similarly, when considering the proportionality of the impact of the ban on free expression to its salutary effects on the fairness of the trial it will be necessary to bear in mind the fundamental importance of trial fairness, both to the accused and to society.
     (4) General Guidelines
     In order to provide guidance for future cases, I suggest the following general guidelines for practice with respect to the application of the common law rule for publication bans:
     (a) At the motion for the ban, the judge should give the media standing (if sought) according to the rules of criminal procedure and the established common law principles with regard to standing.
     (b)The judge should, where possible, review the publication at issue.
     (c) The party seeking to justify the limitation of a right (in the case of a publication ban, the party seeking to limit freedom of expression) bears the burden of justifying the limitation.  The  


page 891

party claiming under the common law rule that a publication ban is necessary to avoid a real and serious risk to the fairness of the trial is seeking to use the power of the state to achieve this objective.  A party who uses the power of the state against others must bear the burden of proving that the use of state power is justified in a free and democratic society.  Therefore, the party seeking the ban bears the burden of proving that the proposed ban is necessary, in that it relates to an important objective that cannot be achieved by a reasonably available and effective alternative measure, that the proposed ban is as limited (in scope, time, content, etc.) as possible, and there is a proportionality between the salutary and deleterious effects of the ban.  At the same time, the fact that the party seeking the ban may be attempting to safeguard a constitutional right must be borne in mind when determining whether the proportionality test has been satisfied.
     (d) The judge must consider all other options besides the ban and must find that there is no reasonable and effective alternative available.
     (e) The judge must consider all possible ways to limit the ban and must limit the ban as much as possible; and
     (f) The judge must weigh the importance of the objectives of the particular ban and its probable effects against the importance of the particular expression that will be limited to ensure that the positive and negative effects of the ban are proportionate.
     IV. Disposition
     On the jurisdictional issue, I find that Gotlib J. had jurisdiction to hear a motion from Radford and Dugas.  The Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from this order.  The Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act to hear both the appeal of the Court of Appeal decision and an appeal from the order of Gotlib J.


page 892


     On the publication ban issue, I find that the Court of Appeal erred in hearing the appeal.  Accordingly, I set aside the order of the Court of Appeal.  I also find that the terms of the ban ordered by Gotlib J. cannot be justified by the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans.   She thereby committed an error of law.  Accordingly, I set aside her order.
     The appeal is allowed.
     The following are the reasons delivered by
     LA FOREST J. (dissenting) -- Like Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, I respectfully do not agree that there is a direct appeal to this Court under s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 , from Gotlib J.'s decision.  On the basis of the reasoning in support of such an appeal, I fear applications for leave from any number of interlocutory rulings in criminal proceedings could be made to this Court.  This is not to say that the appellants have no remedy.  Apart from declaratory actions (which may be the most appropriate remedy here), a remedy might well be available by virtue of s. 24(1)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  even against a decision of a superior court judge; see R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588.  Since a decision made under that provision is not otherwise open to appeal, it is a final order within the meaning of s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act , and so open to appeal, with leave, to this Court (see my reasons in Kourtessis v. M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53).  This specific point did not arise in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863; indeed I there specifically referred to the possibility that an appeal might lie to this Court (p. 978).
     I should say that I do not think Gotlib J.'s decision is immune from Charter  scrutiny by reason of the fact that it is a court order.  This case is distinguishable from RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573.  The order here, unlike  


page 893

Dolphin Delivery, is one exercised pursuant to a discretionary power directed at a governmental purpose, i.e., ensuring a fair trial.  It is not the invocation of the law by a private individual.  It is a by-product, in this case having effect outside the criminal process, of the institution by the Crown of criminal proceedings.  The fact that the rule under which it was made was judicially created does not matter.  The making of such laws emanates from the role historically assigned to the Queen's judges.  They were exercising powers flowing from the sovereign as the fountain of justice.  The Charter  applies to common law as well as to statutes.  The effect of the order here was the infringement of the appellants' Charter  right to freedom of expression to serve a governmental purpose and is in consequence subject to Charter  scrutiny.  I find Justice McLachlin's comments on this issue particularly helpful.
     I do not think any other appeal route is open to the appellants.  In particular, the proposal advanced by McLachlin J. that s. 24(1)  of the Charter  can itself be used to create a right of appeal is, in my view, inconsistent with the policy thrust in Mills.  As well, I agree with the Chief Justice that civil appeal procedures are unavailable and that certiorari would not lie under the circumstances of this case.  The situation in Kourtessis where I contemplated the extension of certiorari to cover the situation there was entirely different from the one arising here; see my reasons in that case, at pp. 90-92.
     I should say, however, that I am concerned with the Chief Justice's obiter remarks concerning certiorari.  I think what is called for is a discretionary form of review, so as to avoid undue interference with the trial process.  Unless the discretion to issue certiorari as the Chief Justice would expand it is exercised in a restrained manner, it, along with the appeals from it, might delay or otherwise seriously interfere with criminal proceedings.  Should this  


page 894

expansion of certiorari jurisdiction be permitted, discretion to exercise it should be restrained in the manner I have indicated in Kourtessis, at p. 92.  It might, in fact, be as well to simply leave the appellants the right to apply to a superior court judge for a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  That remedy is itself discretionary.  As I see it, it is akin to a court's discretionary power to grant a declaration and should be exercised with similar restraints; see the discussion of the nature of the discretion to be exercised in relation to declaratory actions in Kourtessis, at pp. 86-87.
     I reiterate the Chief Justice's hope that Parliament will provide for an appeal from publication bans to the provincial courts of appeal, though I think an appeal with leave would be better suited to the task.  It will be evident from what I have earlier said that I share the concerns of L'Heureux-Dubé J. about the dangers of delay and interference with the trial process that could result from uncontrolled access to judicial review or appeal of interlocutory orders in criminal proceedings.
     Given my view on jurisdiction, I would not ordinarily say anything about the merits.  In light of the disposition of this case by the Court, however, I will make the following comments.  I am in agreement with the Chief Justice that the common law rule did not give sufficient protection to freedom of expression.  I am also in substantial agreement with the list of factors he gives that should be considered by a judge in determining whether a ban should issue.  I would, however, add another factor that should be weighed in determining whether a ban should issue -- the extent to which a ban could disrupt the trial, particularly by creating the risk that the trial would not take place within a reasonable time.
     I would dismiss the appeal.


page 895


     The following are the reasons delivered by
     L'HEUREUX-DUBÉ J. (dissenting) -- This case and the companion case of R. v. S. (T.), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 952, in which judgment is handed down contemporaneously with this one, concern third party challenges to publication bans issued during criminal proceedings.  Both cases raise similar procedural and substantive issues.
     In the case before us, the appellants are challenging an interlocutory publication ban issued by Gotlib J. of the Ontario Court (General Division) and upheld with several modifications by the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The impugned publication ban prevented the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (""CBC"") from broadcasting a four-hour mini-series entitled The Boys of St. Vincent until after the completion of the criminal trials of the respondents, Dagenais, Monette, Dugas and Radford.

This appeal raises two principal issues, the first procedural and the second substantive.  The procedural issue concerns whether or not this Court has the jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  This requires a determination of whether third parties, such as the CBC, have the right to appeal interlocutory court orders, such as publication bans, arising out of criminal proceedings.  The substantive issue concerns the merits of the appellants' challenge of the impugned publication ban on the grounds that it infringes s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  Furthermore, both issues require this Court to consider whether or not the Charter  applies to court orders.
     Before proceeding with an analysis of these issues, it is important to note that the jurisdictional question raised in this case and in the companion case of R. v. S. (T.) has broad implications.  While on a narrow reading it deals only with the question of whether or not third parties can appeal publication bans issued in the criminal context, in effect it has broad implications with respect to third party appeals from all interlocutory criminal orders.  If  


page 896

the media can appeal a publication ban issued in the criminal context then every third party, including witnesses, experts, members of the public who are expelled from the courts, lawyers, etc., will be able to appeal any interlocutory order issued in the criminal context which they believe infringes their Charter  rights.  Such a broad interlocutory right of appeal will result in significant delay to the trial process, will adversely impact upon the accused's Charter  right to be tried within a reasonable time and will adversely affect the administration of justice.  While both the Chief Justice and McLachlin J. argue that these negative consequences may not arise, I do not find their arguments convincing.
     First, McLachlin J. argues that delays in the trial process will not necessarily result from allowing third parties to appeal interlocutory court orders issued in the criminal context.  However, this is inconsistent with her argument that a third party must have access to a ""full and effective remedy"" which includes ""recourse to an appellate tribunal"" where that third party alleges an infringement of its Charter  rights.  In many, if not most cases, a third party appeal from an interlocutory criminal order will only be ""effective"" if the related criminal proceedings are delayed until the resolution of the appeal.  Accordingly, the negative consequences described above seem inevitable.
     Similarly, I do not find convincing the Chief Justice's suggestion that there is no need to be concerned that allowing third parties to appeal publication bans issued in the criminal context will open the door to a large number of witnesses appealing interlocutory criminal orders.  The Chief Justice states (at p. 862):
     The problem for a witness most frequently arises out of a citation for contempt for refusal to  


page 897

testify. . . . [Section] 10 of the Code sets out the procedure for bringing a conviction for contempt before a court of appeal.  This decision will not change or affect that statutory procedure and right of appeal.
     While it is true that witnesses currently have a statutory right of appeal where they are cited for contempt of court, I must emphasize that this right of appeal is only available to the small proportion of witnesses who are actually cited for contempt.  If the appellants are permitted to appeal the impugned publication ban in the case at hand, however, a broad third party interlocutory right of appeal, available to all witnesses, will result.  This will enable all witnesses, whether or not they are cited for contempt of court, to appeal interlocutory criminal orders which they believe infringe their Charter  rights.
     Accordingly, despite the comments of both the Chief Justice and McLachlin J. to the contrary, I believe that permitting the appellants to appeal the impugned publication ban in the case at hand will enable a large number of third parties to appeal interlocutory criminal orders they would otherwise be unable to appeal, and will therefore have a significant adverse impact on an accused's right to be tried within a reasonable time and on the proper administration of justice.
     With this broader context in mind, I turn to the case currently before us.  I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of my colleagues.  Unlike the Chief Justice, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ., I do not believe that this Court has the necessary jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  In light of this, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the substantive issue.  However, had I found that this Court had jurisdiction to hear this appeal, I would have agreed with Gonthier J., and disagreed with the Chief Justice, McLachlin and La Forest JJ., on the substantive issue.  Accordingly, my reasons will focus on the jurisdictional question.


page 898


     I.  Jurisdiction
     In concluding that the appellants have a right to appeal in the case at hand, the Chief Justice and McLachlin J. appear to rely on the axiom ""where there is a right, there is a remedy"".  While this axiom may not be absolute, I agree that when a person alleges a wrong, be it a constitutional wrong, a civil wrong or a criminal wrong, she is entitled in our free and democratic society to submit her case to a forum in order to try to obtain redress.  This is the basis upon which our judicial system is premised.  The fact that a person has standing and is permitted to appear and be heard before a court of law or any other judicial forum, as was the case here, is the first step in the process of providing a remedy for an alleged wrong.  The second step is the rendering of a decision by a court of law or other judicial forum.  Together, these two steps constitute a remedy.  Whether the decision is affirmative or negative does not alter the fact that there was access to a remedy.
     In the present case, had the CBC been successful before Gotlib J. in avoiding a publication ban, the CBC would have had their remedy.  The fact that they were not successful does not alter the fact that they had access to a remedy.  Thus, the axiom ""where there is a right, there is a remedy"" is satisfied.  There was a remedy available: the CBC had standing, was heard, and a decision was reached to issue a publication ban despite their arguments to the contrary.  Consequently, the jurisdictional question raised by this appeal is not whether the CBC should have access to a remedy, but whether the CBC should have a right to appeal a decision with which they are not satisfied.
     In approaching this question, it is important to note that it is distinct and independent from the substantive question concerning freedom of expression and publication bans.  While I will find that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, this determination should not be  


page 899

understood as calling into question the fundamental importance of freedom of expression.  Freedom of expression is, in my view, a fundamental right.  Recognition of this fact in Canadian law predates the Charter .  In Reference re Alberta Statutes, [1938] S.C.R. 100, Duff C.J. recognized (at p. 133) that:
     . . . it is axiomatic that the practice of this right of free public discussion of public affairs . . . is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions.
     Furthermore, in Boucher v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 265, Rand J. also emphasized (at p. 288) that:
     Freedom in thought and speech and disagreement in ideas and beliefs, on every conceivable subject, are of the essence of our life.
     In Switzman v. Elbling, [1957] S.C.R. 285, at p. 306, Rand J. described freedom of political expression as ""little less vital to man's mind and spirit than breathing is to his physical existence"".
     Since the proclamation of the Charter , freedom of expression has obtained explicit constitutional protection and the courts have reiterated the fundamental importance of this right.  In Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, Cory J. stated (at p. 1336) that it would be ""difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society than freedom of expression"".  As well, in Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139, I wrote at p. 174:
     Freedom of expression, like freedom of religion, serves to anchor the very essence of our democratic political and societal structure.
     Nonetheless, these and other affirmations of the fundamental importance of freedom of expression do not change the fact that the jurisdictional issue raised by this case concerns the right of appeal, not the right to freedom of expression.  The right to freedom of expression is protected by access to an initial remedy.  I cannot accept McLachlin J.'s  


page 900

suggestion that a ""full and effective remedy"" for an infringement of freedom of expression ""must include recourse to an appellate tribunal"".  Access to a remedy and the right to appeal the refusal of a remedy are entirely different issues.
     In our free and democratic society, a right of appeal is not available in every situation.  (See, for example, Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863; R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764; R. v. C. (T.L.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 1012; and Kourtessis v. M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53.)  As Sopinka and Gelowitz noted in The Conduct of an Appeal (1993), at p. vii:
     Counsel contemplating an appeal must first ensure that he or she has a right of appeal.  This right is purely statutory and each appellate court is governed by the applicable statutes and rules with their own jurisdictional criteria, time limits and appeal routes.
     Furthermore, even where a right of appeal is available, it is frequently subject to a requirement of leave to appeal.  As a result, the term ""right"" of appeal is somewhat misleading in that it is not a ""right"" in the same sense as those provided in the Charter .  Instead, it is a right which is created by a simple act of the legislature and which can be just as easily eliminated by such an act.  La Forest  J., with whom I concurred, held as follows in Kourtessis, supra, at pp. 69-70:
     Appeals are solely creatures of statute; see R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764, at p. 1773.  There is no inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court.  Nowadays, however, this basic proposition tends at times to be forgotten.  Appeals to appellate courts and to the Supreme Court of Canada have become so established and routine that there is a widespread expectation that there must be some way to appeal the decision of a court of first instance.  But it remains true that there is no right of appeal on any matter unless provided for by the relevant legislature.  [Emphasis added.]
     As an exception to the principle that a right of appeal must be created by statute, it was recently suggested that a limited common law jurisdictional  


page 901

appeal may be available (see M. Jamal and H. P. Glenn, ""Selective Legality: The Common Law Jurisdictional Appeal"" (1994), 73 Can. Bar Rev. 142).  However, the jurisdiction of the Ontario Court (General Division) to issue the impugned publication ban is not attacked in the present case.  Thus, if there is a right of appeal in the present case, it can only be provided by statute.  Neither the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 , nor any other applicable statute provides for such a right of appeal.  Furthermore, the Charter  does not confer appellate jurisdiction.  Consequently, I conclude that there is no jurisdiction in our Court, nor was there in the Court of Appeal, to entertain this appeal.
     Although this is the general basis for my opinion on the jurisdictional question, I will discuss the particulars in more detail in the following order:
     1.The Criminal Code  does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to hear this appeal;
     2.The Supreme Court Act  does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to hear this appeal;
     3.Section 24(1)  of the Charter  does not confer appellate jurisdiction; and
     4.The Charter  does not apply to court orders.
     I will not discuss certiorari, the rules of which are well known and are clearly not applicable in this case, as the Chief Justice himself has noted.
     1.  The Criminal Code 
     As I have already mentioned, it is well established that a right of appeal exists only if specifically provided by statute.  Given the fact that the appeal at issue arises out of criminal proceedings, the logical first place to look for a statutory right of appeal is the Criminal Code .  No such right of appeal is provided therein.  Furthermore, s. 674 of the Criminal Code  states:


page 902


     674. No proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXVI shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences.
     I agree with the Chief Justice when he says (at p. 864) that:
     . . . we are dealing here with media challenges to publication bans ordered by judges under their common law or legislated discretionary authority in response to a request for a ban made by the Crown and/or by individuals charged (or at risk of being charged) with criminal offences.  Such challenges are criminal matters, not civil ones.  [Emphasis added.]
     In my view, this appeal therefore qualifies as a proceeding in respect of an indictable offence.  Similarly, I note that Bayda C.J.S., writing for the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the companion case of R. v. S. (T.), held that:
     No one, including the C.B.C., questioned that this appeal was ""in proceedings in respect of indictable offences"" within the meaning of s. 674.

((1993), 109 Sask. R. 96, at p. 103.)
     Accordingly, pursuant to s. 674  of the Criminal Code , the appellants are only entitled to challenge the impugned publication ban by way of appeal if such a right is established in the Criminal Code , which, as I have already noted, it is not.  However, the Chief Justice argues that s. 674  of the Criminal Code  does not limit the broad jurisdiction conferred upon this Court by s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  Furthermore, he asserts that s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  provides this Court with the necessary jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  I turn now to this argument.
     2.  Section 40(1) of the Supreme Court Act
     Despite the express wording of s. 674  of the Criminal Code , the Chief Justice suggests that s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  provides this Court with jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  As he does in  


page 903

R. v. Laba, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965, the Chief Justice argues at p. 860 that:
     . . . s. 674  of the Criminal Code  does not limit our jurisdiction to grant leave in cases such as this under s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .
     In support of this proposition, he relies on cases such as R. v. Swietlinski, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 481; R. v. Vaillancourt (1990), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 384 (S.C.C.); R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368; Hill v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827; and R. v. Barnes, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449.  However, as I noted in Laba, supra, at p. 992:
     . . . while these cases all appear to implicitly hold that s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  is not limited by s. 674  of the Criminal Code , none of these cases explicitly refer, in this respect, to s. 674  of the Criminal Code  or to its interaction with s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  [Emphasis added.]
     Nonetheless, even assuming that s. 674  of the Criminal Code  does not restrict the scope of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act , this does not mean that s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  is unlimited in scope.  For example, although s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  has been held to provide this Court with jurisdiction to entertain interlocutory appeals in civil matters (Bar of the Province of Quebec v. Ste-Marie, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 414), it has not been so interpreted with respect to interlocutory criminal appeals.  In fact, Mills, supra, and Meltzer, supra, clearly establish that ""there should be no interlocutory appeals in criminal matters"".  At page 959 of Mills, supra, McIntyre J. stated:
     The question has been raised as to whether there can be something in the nature of an interlocutory appeal in which a claimant for relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  may appeal immediately upon a refusal of his claim and before the trial is completed.  It has long been a settled principle that all criminal appeals are statutory and that there should be no interlocutory appeals in criminal matters.  This principle has been reinforced in our Criminal Code  (s. 602  [now s. 674 ], supra) prohibiting procedures on appeal beyond those authorized in the Code.  It will be observed that interlocutory appeals are not authorized in the Code.  [Emphasis added.]


page 904


     Discussing the availability of interlocutory criminal appeals, Sopinka and Gelowitz, supra, at p. 78, state that:
     It would appear to be settled law that there are no appeals in interlocutory criminal proceedings, as there is no statutory basis for such appeals. . . .
     This position was not altered by the proclamation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The Supreme Court of Canada has held in Mills v. R., and  R. v. Meltzer, that the Charter  does not create new rights of appeal.  Any Charter ground sought to be appealed must, accordingly, be taken pursuant to existing rights of appeal as established in the Code.
     Consequently, to the extent that this appeal is from an interlocutory order, permitting it to proceed, as the Chief Justice does, by virtue of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  is inconsistent with the jurisprudence of this Court.
     This brings me to the issue of whether or not this appeal can be fairly characterized as interlocutory in nature.  I begin by noting that the impugned publication ban is clearly an interlocutory order from the point of view of the accused.  However, from the point of view of the appellants, this order is, for all intents and purposes, final.  In fact, any court order made in a criminal context which affects a third party, including any order directed at witnesses, could likely be characterized as ""final"" from the point of view of the affected third party.  Accordingly, the argument can be made that a third party appeal against such an order would not be precluded by the principle against interlocutory criminal appeals and could therefore proceed by virtue of s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act .  This argument, in my view, cannot succeed.
     The focus in criminal proceedings is on the accused and on the determination of guilt or innocence.  While a publication ban or any other order affecting a third party issued during a criminal proceeding may be final with respect to that third party, it is interlocutory with respect to the accused.  Since the focus in criminal proceedings  


page 905

must remain on the accused, to the extent that the order is interlocutory from the accused's point of view it should not be subject to a third party appeal unless the right to such an appeal is specifically provided by statute.
     To hold otherwise would be to ignore the policy behind the principle against interlocutory criminal appeals.  Specifically, as I noted in Laba, supra, such appeals are not permitted because of the likelihood that they would fragment the criminal trial process and cause potentially lengthy delays: R. v. Morgentaler, Smoling and Scott (1984), 41 C.R. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 273-74, and R. v. Cranston (1983), 60 N.S.R. (2d) 269 (C.A.).  These policy reasons are applicable whether the appellant is a party to the criminal proceedings or a third party.  In fact, in light of the right of the accused, guaranteed by s. 11 (b) of the Charter , to be tried within a reasonable time, these policy concerns are particularly applicable where the appellant is a third party.  It is of particular importance that third parties not be permitted to cause an accused's trial to be unreasonably delayed.  Furthermore, even if the trial continued while the third party appeal proceeded, as it did in this case, but which will often not be the case, there remains the problem of requiring an accused to defend two cases at the same time, given that the accused will likely have a legitimate interest in both proceedings.  This may unduly complicate the accused's criminal defense and should therefore be avoided wherever possible.  Finally, I note that if third party interlocutory criminal appeals were permitted, this would result in a strange and unacceptable situation where third parties would benefit from greater appellate rights in criminal proceedings than would the accused whose very liberty hinges on the outcome of the proceedings.
     In light of all the above, I conclude that the principle against interlocutory criminal appeals is equally applicable to the accused, the Crown and third parties.  Only if a right of appeal is explicitly established by statute should an appeal against an  


page 906

interlocutory court order arising out of criminal proceedings be permitted to proceed.
     Turning now to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act , I note that, while it was intended to confer broad appellate jurisdiction on this Court, it was not, in my opinion, intended to override the principle against interlocutory criminal appeals.  For such a sweeping interpretation to be given to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  requires, in my opinion, that Parliament use the clearest of language.  Section 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  does not meet this test.  Consequently, just as it has not been interpreted to provide parties to criminal proceedings with an interlocutory right of appeal, it should not be so interpreted with respect to third parties.  Accordingly, I find that s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  I leave open, however, the question of whether it provides this Court with jurisdiction to hear a third party appeal from a court order in a criminal context where the order in question is ""final"" with respect to both the parties to the criminal proceeding and the affected third party.
     3.  Section 24(1) of the Charter
     A final possible source of jurisdiction for this appeal was raised in the companion case of R. v. S. (T.).  The appellant in that case suggested that s. 24(1)  of the Charter  provides third parties with a right to appeal publication bans issued in the criminal context.  This suggestion appears to have been accepted by McLachlin J. in her reasons in this case.  Specifically, McLachlin J. implies that the Charter  imposes minimal procedural requirements which include ""recourse to an appellate tribunal"" where a third party is challenging a publication ban on Charter  grounds.  I disagree.
     In my view, it is well settled that the Charter  does not and cannot provide the appellants with a  


page 907

right of appeal.  In Mills, supra, McIntyre J. stated at pp. 956-57:
     As has been said on many occasions, the Charter  was not enacted in a vacuum.  It was created to form a part -- a very important part -- of the Canadian legal system and, accordingly, must fit into that system.  It will be noted at once that s. 24(1)  gives no jurisdictional or procedural guide.  This absence makes it clear that the procedures presently followed must be adapted and used for the accommodation of applications for relief under s. 24(1) . [Emphasis added.]
     Later, at p. 958, he repeated:

Again, it must be observed that the Charter  is silent on the question of appeals and the conclusion must therefore be that the existing appeal structure must be employed in the resolution of s. 24(1)  claims. [Emphasis added.]
     As I stated at the outset, appeal rights are statutory.  In the absence of a statutory right of appeal, this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  The appellants cannot rely on s. 24(1)  of the Charter  to create appellate jurisdiction.  While, as I observed earlier, it has been said on many occasions that for every right there should be a remedy (see, for example, Mills, supra, at pp. 971-72 (per La Forest J.) and at p. 958 (per McIntyre J.); and Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 196 (per Lamer J.)), this does not mean that s. 24(1)  can confer appellate jurisdiction where the appellants, as here, had access to a remedy and are unsatisfied with the result.  Were this a case where the appellants had no access whatsoever to an initial remedy then s. 24(1)  might confer jurisdiction to provide an initial remedy, such as giving the appellants standing to raise the issue.  However this is not such a case.
     Finally, I find it important to emphasize, once more, that this case concerns an appeal from an interlocutory criminal order.  The ability of s. 24(1)  to confer appellate jurisdiction with respect to interlocutory criminal appeals was conclusively  


page 908

determined in Mills, supra, and Meltzer, supra.  In this respect, I adopt the following comments of Bayda C.J.S. of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal from his reasons (at p. 104) in the companion case of R. v. S. (T.):
     . . . if the present appeal is properly characterized as in respect of an interlocutory ruling by a trial court judge in the course of a criminal proceeding, then the decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Mills, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764 and Kourtessis make it clear that the Charter  component does not vest a court of appeal with any special power to hear an appeal and the right of appeal is governed by the same principles as those which apply to an appeal from any ordinary interlocutory ruling.  Those same cases confirm that there is no appeal from an interlocutory ruling made in a criminal proceeding. [Emphasis added.]
     Therefore, for all the reasons outlined above, I conclude that s. 24(1)  does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
     4.  The Applicability of the Charter to Court Orders 
     McLachlin J. argues in her reasons, apparently with the support of La Forest J., that the Charter  applies to the impugned publication ban.  In my view it does not.
     The principle that court orders per se are not subject to the Charter  was first established in RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573.  Dolphin Delivery concerned an appeal against an injunction which prevented certain secondary picketing on the grounds that it abridged the Charter  guarantee of freedom of expression.  Factually, it was quite similar to the case at hand in that it involved a private party (a union) challenging a court order on the ground that it was inconsistent with s. 2 (b) of the Charter .  McIntyre J., writing for the majority, stated at pp. 600-601:


page 909


     While in political science terms it is probably acceptable to treat the courts as one of the three fundamental branches of Government, that is, legislative, executive, and judicial, I cannot equate for the purposes of Charter  application the order of a court with an element of governmental action. . . . To regard a court order as an element of governmental intervention necessary to invoke the Charter  would, it seems to me, widen the scope of Charter  application to virtually all private litigation.  All cases must end, if carried to completion, with an enforcement order and if the Charter   precludes the making of the order, where a Charter  right would be infringed, it would seem that all private litigation would be subject to the Charter .  In my view, this approach will not provide the answer to the question.  A more direct and more precisely-defined connection between the element of government action and the claim advanced must be present before the Charter   applies.  [Emphasis added.]
     I considered this Court's decision in Dolphin Delivery, supra, in Young v. Young, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, and noted (at pp. 90-91) that:
     . . . Dolphin Delivery . . . articulated the principle which established the threshold for judicial review under the Charter : the Charter  applies to the legislative, executive and administrative branches of government but does not apply to judicial orders made in the resolution of private disputes.
     The rule in Dolphin Delivery, however, does not fully insulate a judge from the Charter  in all circumstances and does not apply to certain adjudicators.  Thus, in R. v. Rahey, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, this Court concluded that a trial judge's conduct in according 19 adjournments and taking 11 months to reach a decision on an application for a directed verdict contravened the Charter  and specifically the accused's right to be tried within a reasonable time.  Furthermore, in B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214, an order to prevent picketing in front of the court, issued by the court on its own motion, originating in the inherent power of the courts to control their process, and issued without notice to the affected party, was reviewed on Charter  grounds and found not to violate the Charter .   


page 910

Finally, in Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, this Court found that an order of an adjudicator pursuant to the Canada Labour Code  was subject to Charter  review, since such an adjudicator, unlike a judge, is a creature of statute who is appointed pursuant to a legislative provision and derives all of his or her powers from statute.  These three cases clearly demonstrate that Dolphin Delivery does not fully insulate a judge or an adjudicator from the Charter .  Specifically, these cases demonstrate that the Charter  applies to certain judicial conduct, to the exercise by the courts of their inherent right to control their process, and to adjudicators under the Canada Labour Code .  However, this is by no means inconsistent with the holding in Dolphin Delivery that court orders per se are  not subject to the Charter .  While some judicial activity may be subject to the Charter , a court order per se is not.  In light of the above, I conclude that in the case at hand the impugned publication ban is not subject to the Charter .
     Having said this, I believe it is important to review some of the policy justifications for the general principle that the Charter  does not apply to court orders per se.  First, as McIntyre J. notes, if court orders were subject to the Charter  then all private litigation could become subject to the Charter .  This is

clearly inconsistent with s. 32  of the Charter  which says that the Charter  applies only to the ""Parliament and government of Canada"" and the ""legislature and government of each province"".  Furthermore, if the Charter  applied to court orders then, at least theoretically, individuals adversely affected by a court order could seek a remedy, be it damages or otherwise, pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter , against the judge who originally issued the impugned court order.  Such a result is, in my view, unacceptable.  Finally, applying the Charter  to court orders could result in endless loops of litigation where even final orders of the Supreme Court of Canada, the  


page 911

highest court in the land and the court of final appeal, could be challenged at first instance on Charter  grounds.  This would be a strange and unjustifiable situation which could paralyse our judicial system by removing the certainty from supposedly final judgments.  The Charter  could not have been intended to produce such a result.  For all of these reasons, and in light of the decision of this Court in Dolphin Delivery, supra, and my reasons in Young, supra, I conclude that the Charter  does not apply to court orders per se.
     This does not mean, however,  that the Charter  does not apply to the common law, or for that matter to the Civil Code, the Criminal Code  or other statutory laws, which govern the issuance of court orders.  For example, as I noted at p. 92 of Young, supra:
     . . . Charter  values nonetheless remain an important consideration in judicial decision-making.  Courts must strive to uphold Charter  values, and preference should be given to such values in the interpretation of legislation over those which run contrary to them (Slaight Communications, supra; Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513, at p. 558; Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554).
     Similarly, in Dolphin Delivery, supra, McIntyre J. held that the courts were under an obligation to ""apply and develop the principles of the common law in a manner consistent with the fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution"" (p. 603).
     Furthermore, in R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, Iacobucci J., speaking for the Court, stated (at p. 675) that:
     Where the principles underlying a common law rule are out of step with the values enshrined in the Charter , the courts should scrutinize the rule closely.  If it is possible to change the common law rule so as to make it  


page 912

consistent with Charter  values, without upsetting the proper balance between judicial and legislative action that I have referred to above, then the rule ought to be changed.
     Finally, it is important to recall that s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982  provides that:
     52. (1) The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect. [Emphasis added.]
     All laws of Canada, including the common law, are therefore subject to the Charter .  This is particularly important with respect to the second issue raised in this appeal, the substantive merits of the appellants' challenge of the impugned publication ban on the ground that it contravenes the Charter .  While the publication ban is not subject to the Charter , the common law governing its issuance is subject to Charter  scrutiny.
     5.  Summary
     For all of the reasons outlined above, I conclude that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  I realize that this may leave some with a sense of unease.  Bayda C.J.S. of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal noted (at p. 107) in the companion case of R. v. S. (T.) that:
     The nature of the C.B.C.'s complaint and its legal inability to have the propriety of the ruling it received respecting that complaint immediately tested on appeal, leaves one with a sense of unease.  Given the structure of our appellate law, it is Parliament, and Parliament alone, that is empowered to relieve that unease by providing some form of immediate appellate review. . . .
     I agree with Bayda C.J.S. that it is Parliament, not the courts, which must develop appellate procedures for third parties challenging interlocutory orders such as publication bans which arise out of criminal proceedings.  In Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, this Court discussed the appropriate boundary between the judiciary and the Parliament with respect to the fashioning of  


page 913

remedies when legislation violates the Charter .  In Watkins v. Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750, this Court outlined when it was appropriate for the judiciary to modify common law rules.  The policy considerations discussed in both these cases also apply here and clearly support the conclusion that it is Parliament, not the Court, which should develop third party interlocutory criminal appellate procedures.  However, were it to be our responsibility to develop such procedures, I would lean against providing third parties with the right to appeal  interlocutory criminal orders.  As I have already noted, there are strong policy reasons against permitting interlocutory criminal appeals.   It is imperative that criminal trials proceed within a reasonable time and not be delayed and fragmented by numerous interlocutory appeals.  If the CBC were allowed to appeal the publication ban ordered in this case, then witnesses, experts and others would also be able to appeal court orders requiring them to testify or provide documentary evidence at criminal trials.  This would result in unreasonable delays and would compromise the accused's s. 11 (b) rights under the Charter .  On the other hand, if the trial continued while the third party appeal proceeded, as it did in this case, then the accused would be required to defend two proceedings at the same time.  This may complicate the accused's criminal defense and should be avoided wherever possible.  Consequently, were it up to this Court to develop third party interlocutory criminal appellate procedures, which it is not, I would hold that no such procedures should be created.  While third parties must have access to a remedy where they allege a Charter  violation, they need not have access to an appeal.
     In conclusion, I would resolve the jurisdictional question by holding that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal.  For the sake of clarity, and  


page 914

to prevent future litigation, I would also note, as my colleague the Chief Justice did, that the Ontario Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
     Finally, I turn briefly to the jurisdiction of Gotlib J. to issue the publication ban in question.  I agree with the Chief Justice that wherever possible a motion for a publication ban should be made before the appointed trial judge.  Accordingly, since a trial judge had already been appointed for the respondents Dagenais and Monette, they should have applied to their appointed trial judge and not to Gotlib J. for a publication ban with respect to The Boys of St. Vincent.  Therefore, I agree with the Chief Justice when he concludes that ""Gotlib J. did not have jurisdiction to hear the motions from Dagenais or Monette"" (p. 873).
     II.  Substantive Merits of the Challenge to the Publication Ban
     In light of my conclusions on the jurisdictional issue, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the substantive merits of the appeal.  However, seeing as many of my colleagues have held that we do have jurisdiction to hear this appeal, I feel it necessary to address this issue as well.  Specifically, had I found that we had jurisdiction to hear this appeal, I would have agreed fully with the reasons of my colleague Gonthier J. and would have disposed of the appeal as he does.
     In my view, the substantive issue raised by this appeal requires this Court to perform two analytical steps.  The first is to apply the Charter  to the common law governing the issuance of publication bans in the criminal context.  As I noted earlier, the common law is subject to Charter  scrutiny and must be consistent with Charter  values.  The second step is to ensure that the judge ordering the impugned publication ban did not make a reviewable error in exercising her discretion and applying the common law of publication bans to the case at hand.  While it is true that appellate courts should  


page 915

not in general interfere with a trial judge's exercise of discretion, an appellate court can interfere where that discretion has not been exercised judicially and judiciously.  Specifically, an appellate court can overturn a discretionary decision of a trial judge where it is made, inter alia, on wrong principles, a misapprehension of significant facts or in a non-judicial manner.
     With respect to both of the two analytical steps outlined above, I agree fully with the reasons of my colleague Gonthier J.  In my view, the common law rule governing the issuance of publication bans in the criminal context is consistent with the Charter  and Gotlib J. did not commit any reviewable errors in exercising her discretion and applying the common law rule to the facts of this case and determining that a publication ban was necessary.
     In this respect, I find it necessary to stress my disagreement with the Chief Justice when he states in his reasons that the common law rule governing publication bans, in criminal matters, does not accord sufficient protection to  freedom of expression ""in the context of post-Charter Canadian society"" (p. 875).  Specifically, the Chief Justice argues (at p. 877) that:

The pre-Charter  common law rule governing publication bans emphasized the right to a fair trial over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban.  In my view, the balance this rule strikes is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter , and in particular, the equal status given by the Charter  to ss. 2 (b) and 11 (d).


page 916


     I cannot agree.  The common law rule is based on a recognition and appreciation of both the right to freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial.  In balancing these two rights, the common law provides that where there is a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial a publication ban can be ordered.  Effectively, the common law provides that where freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial cannot both be simultaneously and fully respected, it is appropriate in our free and democratic society to temporarily curtail freedom of expression so as to guarantee an accused a fair trial.  While this common law balancing of fundamental rights was developed in the pre-Charter  era, the proclamation of the Charter  does not render it invalid.  After all, the pre-Charter  balancing was an expression of the very rights protected by the Charter .  In this respect, I agree fully with Gonthier J.'s statement (at pp. 928-929) that:
     It might be suggested that my references to the common law tradition are irrelevant in the age of the Charter .  In my view, however, the Charter  does not oblige departing from this tradition in any substantive respect. . . .  The impact of the Charter  will be minimal in areas where the common law is an expression of, rather than a derogation from, fundamental values.
     For the reasons outlined above and those canvassed by Gonthier J. in his judgment, had I found that this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal, which I do not, I would have disposed of this case as does my colleague Gonthier J.
     III.  Conclusion
     Canada, as a free and democratic society, has always strived to respect the fundamental rights of its citizens including the right of freedom of expression.  The Charter  has constitutionalized such basic rights.  As well, as part of our democratic tradition, judges have always had the discretion to order in camera hearings or issue full or partial publication bans related to judicial proceedings, be it under the criminal, civil or common law.  When issued during the course of a criminal trial, such publication bans were not, even to this  


page 917

day, ever subject to appeal either by the Crown, the accused or a third party.  The rule against interlocutory criminal appeals insured that no such appeals were permitted.  The rationale for this rule is obvious: (i) interlocutory appeals could delay trials indefinitely or, at least substantially; (ii) such delays could result in denying an accused the right to be tried within a reasonable time; and (iii) such delays could considerably impede the administration of justice and open floodgates for those intent on obstructing justice.  Avoiding these negative consequences is as important today as it was hundreds of years ago.  The Charter  has not altered the need to avoid undue delay to the trial process just as it has not guaranteed every citizen of this country a right of appeal on any matter alleged to have infringed a Charter  right.  Parliament could, of course, legislate to provide for such a right of appeal.  However, it has not chosen to do so.  This is true even though the Charter  has now been in force for some 12 years.  It is not up to this Court, or any other court for that matter, to reverse a rule which has existed for hundreds of years in this free and democratic Canadian society without any disastrous effect or even complaint.   Such a radical change in the way our criminal law has operated for hundreds of years must be made by Parliament.  Parliament is the appropriate body to consider the implications of any changes to criminal appellate procedures and to decide on the appropriate measures to implement them.  Therefore, until such time as Parliament provides for a third party right of appeal from interlocutory criminal orders, third parties, including the CBC, cannot appeal from such orders.
     IV.  Disposition
     For the reasons expressed above, I would dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  However, had I found that we had jurisdiction to hear this  


page 918

appeal, I would have disposed of it as my colleague Gonthier J. does.
     The following are the reasons delivered by
     GONTHIER J. (dissenting) -- I have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleagues.
     On the issue of jurisdiction, I agree that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  must inform and govern the determination of the rights of the accused in criminal matters.  This remains so where third parties are affected, in which case their Charter  rights must be considered.  I agree that Gotlib J., a superior court judge, was a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a publication ban in the cases of Radford and Dugas but not in the cases of Dagenais and Monette who could only apply to their appointed trial judge.  In doing so, she was bound to apply the Charter  and her decision constituted the implementation of a Charter  remedy under s. 24(1) .  The issue of a right of review or appeal of this decision bearing on its correctness and conformity with the Charter  rights of the persons affected thereby is a distinct and different one.  Our Court has identified courts of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 24(1)  by reference to the general law governing the jurisdiction of each court as well as rights of review and appeal therefrom.  As McIntyre J. stated in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, s. 24(1)  by referring to a ""court of competent jurisdiction"" does not create courts of competent jurisdiction, but merely vests additional powers in courts which are already found to be competent independently of the Charter .  Further, s. 24(1) does not of itself create a right of review or appeal from a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction where such a right is already provided by law.  I find it unnecessary in this case to pronounce as to rights of appeal or review under s. 24(1)  in other circumstances and I refrain from doing so.  In this case, I share the views expressed by the Chief Justice as to rights of review by way of certiorari of publication ban orders by provincial court judges pursuant to the Charter  and rights of appeal pursuant to s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .  As regards provincial court judges, Charter  remedies

are within the superintending and reforming power of superior courts and certiorari as outlined by the Chief Justice is an appropriate instrument for the exercise of that power with reference to publication ban orders but, being discretionary, should be exercised with restraint so as to avoid undue interference with the trial process.
     In the result, I am in agreement with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be allowed in respect of the publication ban that applied to the proceedings before Gotlib J. and in respect of her order to seal the record.  I also agree that Gotlib J. had no jurisdiction to issue a ban on the application of the respondents Dagenais and Monette.  With all due respect, however, I cannot agree that Gotlib J. erred in banning the broadcast of the mini-series until the end of the pending trials of the two respondents, Dugas and Radford.  I do, however, share the opinion expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal (1992), 12 O.R. (3d) 239 that the ban should have been limited to broadcasting in the province of Ontario and to CBMT-TV in Montreal.
     The central substantive issues in this case are now moot.  My concern in writing therefore is in regard to the general principles governing broadcast/publication bans and their application.  I generally support many of the Chief Justice's statements of principle and general considerations.  I respectfully differ, however, with some of these and with his treatment of the facts of this case as well as the application of principle thereto.  I do not agree with his statement  as to the balance between fair trial and freedom of expression rights under the common law nor that the Charter  has changed this balance.  My purpose in writing is to make clear that the discretion to order publication bans in exceptional cases such as the one now before the Court  


page 920

continues to exist and deal further with the basis upon which that discretion should be exercised.
     I begin by stressing a number of points pertaining to the balancing of the fundamental rights at issue in this case and to appellate review of a trial judge's discretion to order a broadcast ban with particular emphasis on the criterion of real and substantial risk to the fairness of a trial and its application to the assessment of the effectiveness of alternatives to a publication ban.  After having reviewed these basic principles, I turn to the ban issued in this case.

1.  The Balancing of Fundamental Rights in the Context of the Discretion

to Issue Broadcast Bans
     Determining whether to issue a broadcast ban in order to protect the fairness of a trial requires the court to balance two fundamental values which have received equal protection under the Charter .  Refusing to issue a ban may put at risk the fairness of the criminal trial.  Acceding to such a request, on the other hand, is a clear restraint of freedom of expression.  The starting point of any analysis of broadcast or publication bans must be these two values.
     One of the crucial elements of a fair trial is the right to be tried solely on the evidence before the court and not on any information received outside that context.  Section 11 (d) of the Charter  guarantees the right of any person charged with an offence to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.  The fairness of a trial, however, is also of general public interest.  The fairness and integrity of the criminal process is a cornerstone of the legal system.  In protecting the fairness of the trial, both under the Charter  and at common law, courts have frequently recognized that the potential for prejudice relates not only to the accused, but to society in general.


page 921


     Freedom of expression, as this Court has reiterated on numerous occasions, is essential to truth, democracy and personal fulfilment.  Freedom of expression and freedom of the press are also crucial to the public nature of the administration of justice and the potential for scrutiny that comes with such openness.  The importance of freedom of expression and freedom of the press, however, should not censure debate as to their limitation.  Though I agree with the Chief Justice that any limitation on these freedoms or on the public nature of the administration of justice will be highly exceptional, restrictions will occasionally be necessary and acceptable in a free and democratic society.
     At common law, the exceptional nature of publication bans has been assured by requiring that those seeking a ban demonstrate a real and substantial risk of interference with the right to a fair trial.  Some courts have formulated the test in terms of impossibility, but in my view the focus is one of risk and not certainty.  There is an inevitable element of speculation in such an analysis.  What is not history, and often even history, is necessarily speculation.  The United States Supreme Court has focused on the speculative nature of prior restraints as one of the reasons for treating them with extreme caution (see Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976)).  I agree that a court faced with an application for a publication ban must review the factual record and not substitute imagination for careful analysis.  Nevertheless, the tradition in this country and in the United Kingdom has been to accept the propriety of bans even though it cannot be said with certainty that the fairness of a trial will be denied (see R. v. Keegstra (No. 2) (1992), 127 A.R. 232 (C.A.), and Re Global Communications Ltd. and Attorney-General for Canada (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.); see also the general discussion of precedent in Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [1974] A.C. 273 (H.L.), though the case dealt primarily with a publication ban to protect the authority of the judiciary (as I will explain later in these reasons, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights did not affect the general approach taken by British courts or the relevance of the  


page 922

precedents discussed in that decision)).  I will return to the differences between the American and Anglo-Canadian traditions below, but to reiterate, all that is needed in this country to justify a publication ban at common law is that there be a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial.
     The application of the Charter  to the evaluation of publication and broadcast bans, while not directly altering the common law test, will restructure the analysis to some extent.  In terms of Charter  review, determining the correct balance between fair trial and freedom of expression rights falls to the s. 1  analysis.  The existence of two equally fundamental rights in potential conflict informs this analysis.
     An initial question which arises in proceeding with any form of s. 1  balancing is who bears the burden of justifying an infringement.  Each party bears an initial burden of showing a Charter  infringement.  After that initial burden is discharged, however, the balancing of competing Charter  rights is incompatible with a burden on either party.  Burdens are simply means of allocating uncertainty.  It is appropriate in a normal s. 1  analysis to place the burden on the government because it is required to justify legislation or action which infringes a single Charter  right.  Burdens are completely inappropriate where a prima facie case has been made out that the alternative courses of action (i.e., to issue a ban or not) will infringe two different Charter  rights.  In this context, the balancing which is at the heart of the s. 1  analysis should be carried on without privileging or disadvantaging either of the rights at issue.


page 923


     Turning to the actual s. 1  analysis, it would seem that the validity of imposing a ban will be determined almost exclusively at the second and third branches of the proportionality part of the Oakes test.  The first part of the Oakes test, that there be a pressing and substantial objective, is easily satisfied given that the ban is aimed at protecting a Charter  right.  Similarly, the requirement that the impugned measure be rationally connected to the objective, which is the first branch of the proportionality portion of the test, is also easily satisfied.  As the Chief Justice notes, though possible it will rarely be the case that the impugned material will have a total absence of influence.
     As stated above, the heart of the s. 1  analysis of publication and broadcast bans is to be found in the second and third branches of the proportionality part of the Oakes test.  The second or minimal impairment branch is perhaps the aspect of the s. 1  analysis that is most altered when the task is to reconcile two Charter  rights.  The fact that the court must balance fair trial and freedom of expression rights forces a measure of flexibility into the analysis.  If applied blindly or dogmatically, minimal impairment of one of the rights could theoretically mean maximal impairment of the other.
     There is no question, as the Chief Justice has noted, that minimal impairment requires that bans be as narrowly circumscribed as possible in protecting the fairness of a trial.  Just as injunctions aimed at preserving the status quo must be crafted narrowly, the restraint imposed by publication bans must be limited to only that which is necessary to protect the right to a fair trial.  A ban must thus be carefully limited both in terms of temporal and geographic application.
     Minimal impairment also requires evaluation of alternative measures to protect the right to a fair trial.  This evaluation is clearly present, though not necessarily explicit, in the common law  


page 924

requirement that a publication create a real and substantial risk to the fairness of a trial before a ban can be ordered.  In applying his modified version of the common law rule, the Chief Justice would require trial judges to make a finding that there is no reasonably available alternative measure to a publication or broadcast ban.  The existence of alternative measures to protect the fairness of the trial such as sequestration, careful scrutiny of potential jurors and change of venue has been relied on in the United States as the basis for the virtual total rejection of prior restraint orders (see Nebraska Press, supra, and its aftermath).  In my view, the mere existence of alternatives to publication bans, alternatives which are available in almost every case, does not of itself support the denial of a publication ban.  Rather, what is required is the more difficult assessment of the likely effect of the proposed publication ban on freedom of expression and the effectiveness as well as the cost or burden of alternative measures.  An examination of the Anglo-Canadian tradition and the potential burdens of alternative measures will put the existence of such alternatives in perspective.
     Thorson J.A. usefully summarized the difference between the traditional Canadian and American approaches in Global Communications, supra, at pp. 111-12:
     Generally speaking, however, the approach taken in the United States seems to be to allow for the widest possible latitude in media reporting of events transpiring prior to and during the course of the trial of an accused person.  This is counterbalanced, in the interests of ensuring an impartial and unbiased jury, in a number of ways including, during the jury selection process, by an often searching examination into the attitudes, biases and even the personal and financial affairs of potential jurors and, after the jury selection process has been completed, by the sequestration of the members of the jury while the trial is in progress to reduce the risk of their exposure to the media and other publicity generated by it.


page 925


     In Canada, by contrast, the process of jury selection is neither as prolonged nor as exhaustive as a general rule; indeed the kind of questioning and probing into the affairs of potential jurors that is sometimes seen in the United States would be unlikely to be permitted under our system.  Moreover, in Canada the sequestration of jurors throughout a trial occurs only exceptionally.  The strong bias of our system is to prevent the dissemination before the conclusion of the trial of media publicity that might be prejudicial to the accused's fair trial.
     A recent illustration of this openness to preventive measures is Keegstra (No. 2), supra.  In that case, the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld an order prohibiting the production of a play about the life of James Keegstra during Mr. Keegstra's second trial.  In upholding the order, the Court of Appeal rejected the appellant theatre's assertion that there were less drastic remedies to protect the trial process.  In coming to this conclusion, Kerans J.A. provided some insight into the view point at the foundation of a preventive approach, at p. 236:
     But, while urging a juror to be faithful to his or her oath, courts traditionally also try to help the juror by removing undue, unnecessary, and excessive temptations, if possible.  That is what the rule in this case is all about.  Mr. Shea [for the appellant theatre], it seems to us, offers a counsel of despair:  because perfect isolation of the jury is impossible, do not try any form of protection.  We will not succumb to that approach.  We commend the effort of the first judge.  His sole interest in this matter is to help that jury.
     Examples of the resort to preventive measures can be found in both the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , and access to information legislation.  Sections 517  and 539  of the Criminal Code  are two such examples.  Section 517  applies to the publication of evidence adduced at a bail hearing.  Section 539  deals with the publication of evidence adduced during a preliminary inquiry.  In the case of access to information legislation, there are usually provisions that protect government documents, such as investigative reports, which could influence the fairness of a trial (see, for example, s.  


page 926

14(1)(f) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31).  Clearly the alternative measures, and most notably challenge for cause, are available in these situations.  Parliament and the provincial legislatures, however, have expressly opted for the preventive response.
     In the United Kingdom, as in Canada, the power to order a publication ban was historically seen as part of the ability of the courts to deal with ex facie criminal contempt.  Reference to the position and tradition in the United Kingdom may strike some as odd in the face of the condemnation of that country by the European Court of Human Rights in the Sunday Times case, judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A No. 30; condemnation:  11 votes to 9.  The condemnation in the Sunday Times case, however, has been viewed as being based only on differing opinions as to whether an interference with freedom of expression was necessary in the circumstances of the particular case (see D. J. Harris, ""Decisions on the European Convention on Human Rights During 1979"" (1979), 50 Brit. Y.B. Int. L. 257, at p. 259; S. H. Bailey, ""The Contempt of Court Act 1981"" (1982), 45 Mod. L. Rev. 301, at p. 303; contra:  F. A. Mann, ""Contempt of Court in the House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights"" (1979), 95 L.Q.R. 348, at pp. 352-53).  In fact, the majority of the European Court made it clear that it was not condemning the English law of contempt and that there would be cases where restraint would be necessary to avoid ""trial by newspaper"" (see paras. 63, 43 and 65-66; see also the comments of R. Ergec, ""La liberté d'expression, l'autorité et l'impartialité du pouvoir judiciaire"", [1993] Rev. trim. dr. h. 171, at pp. 178-79).  Following the decision in the Sunday Times case, the law of contempt was consolidated and to some extent reformed by the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (U.K.), 1981, c. 49.  The Contempt of Court Act 1981 preserves the power of the courts to deal with publications which imperil the administration of justice.  The test for contempt in regard to publications commenting on legal proceedings is whether the publication ""creates a substantial  


page 927

risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced"" (s. 2(2)). The Contempt of Court Act 1981 thus preserves the ability for courts to intervene in circumstances similar to those now before this Court and implicitly requires an assessment of the suitability of alternative measures.
     In assessing the suitability of alternative measures, judges must keep in mind that these measures impose distinct costs and burdens.  The minimal impairment arm of the proportionality analysis therefore requires the trial judge to do a comparative analysis of effectiveness, feasibility and cost of all possible measures.  Adjourning trials or changing venues imposes obvious costs for all concerned and raises the possibility of a violation of the s. 11 (b) Charter  guarantee of a trial within a reasonable time.  Sequestration of the jury is a very exceptional remedy which Kerans J.A. termed a ""monstrous suggestion"" given that it imposes a heavy burden on those citizens who offer the greatest contribution to the right to a fair trial (Keegstra (No. 2), supra, at p. 235).  Providing strong judicial direction to the jury reflects the confidence we place in the jury system and will be a very real solution when the application is made to a trial judge who has had the opportunity to observe the conduct of the jury throughout the trial.  This was the case for Soublière J.  in the trial of the respondent Dagenais.  Where the trial has yet to begin, a judge may not be satisfied that the remedy would be sufficient.  Such an opinion does not undermine the trust we place in juries, rather, as Kerans J.A. suggested, it would simply reflect a concern to remove undue, unnecessary and excessive temptations.
     In the case of broadcast bans of docudramas related to pending trials, the most obvious alternative remedy is extensive challenges for cause and voir dires during jury selection.  As noted above, the bias against pre-trial bans in the United States  


page 928

has led to a sometimes gruelling jury selection process which has occasionally lasted for up to six weeks.  As Thorson J.A. noted, such a practice does not reflect the tradition in this country.  The recent Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Parks (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324, may be seen as a departure from this tradition.  While refraining from pronouncing upon its correctness, I would point out that that case reflected particular issues outside the context of publication bans.  The exceptional concern to prevent racial discrimination from interfering with an accused's right to a fair trial does not justify sweeping away the Canadian tradition of minimal challenge nor does it justify the potentially huge costs associated with more extensive challenge.
     At the minimal impairment stage, therefore, the trial judge must consider the alternatives to a publication ban but is not bound to find that they would be insufficient.  The concern to help juries in exceptional cases by taking preventive measures requires that trial judges not feel constrained by an overly strict test which would impose costs that we have historically not been prepared to accept.  The flexibility implicit in this formulation means that trial judges will have a wide discretion in evaluating the various means available to protect the right to a fair trial and that the facts of each case will be of great importance in determining what measure is appropriate.

It might be suggested that my references to the common law tradition are irrelevant in the age of the Charter .  In my view, however, the Charter  does not oblige departing from this tradition in any substantive respect.  Clearly this was the opinion of Kerans J.A. and Thorson J.A. in Keegstra (No. 2) and Global Communications, respectively.  I disagree with those who argue that the Charter  requires that we emulate American society and discard the unique balance of fundamental values  


page 929

which existed in this country prior to 1982.  The Charter  provides a means to assure that the enumerated fundamental rights and freedoms are respected.  It does not give primacy to any of those rights.  The impact of the Charter  will be minimal in areas where the common law is an expression of, rather than a derogation from, fundamental values.  The common law pertaining to publication and broadcast bans is an example of one such area.  As I have noted, the requirement that there be a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial process is a clear expression of this balance.
     The final step in the Oakes test requires proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the rights or freedoms in question and the objective.  The Chief Justice would now add a further requirement of proportionality between the salutary and deleterious effects of a measure limiting rights or freedoms.  In order to determine whether there is the requisite proportionality, a court should begin by carefully determining the nature of the infringement.  The nature of any infringement and the effects will vary with the extent of the ban imposed.
     The general purposes of docudramas would appear to support the suggestion that a temporary ban until the end of a trial may well be a minor restriction of the right to freedom of expression.  One purpose of such productions may be to examine current issues of general public importance in an effort to spark discussion and assist in the process of seeking solutions.  A related and less ambitious purpose may simply be to present a thorough account of events of public interest.  Delaying the presentation of a docudrama until the end of a trial would not hinder either of these purposes.  Unlike news, immediacy is not the essence of docudramas.
     I also note that the temporary ban of a docudrama does not in any way affect the fundamental principle of open courts.  Such a ban does not restrict access to the courts nor does it prevent publication in respect of court proceedings.  Those  


page 930

situations present formidable deleterious effects and their analysis should be carefully distinguished from bans pertaining to docudramas (for a recent British examination of this question, see Ex parte Telegraph Plc., [1993] 2 All E.R. 971 (C.A.)).
     On the salutary side of the equation, concerns have been expressed as to the efficacy of publication bans.  It is said that the actual effect of bans on jury impartiality is increasingly negligible given technological advances which make bans difficult to enforce.  With all due respect, it is wrong to simply throw up our hands in the face of such difficulties.  These difficulties simply demonstrate that we live in a rapidly changing global community where regulation in the public interest has not always been able to keep pace with change.  Current national and international regulation may be inadequate, but fundamental principles have not changed nor have the value and appropriateness of taking preventive measures in highly exceptional cases.

In the particular case of docudramas, the salutary effects of temporary bans derive from the potential influence of docudramas on prospective jurors.  In part, the impact of docudramas derives from the power of omniscience afforded to the viewer.  The viewer sees all and therefore knows all in a way that can only exist in fictional works.  What the viewer actually sees, however, is the expression of the agendas of the writer, director and producer.  What the viewer sees is also only partly fiction with little indication of the line between documentary and drama.  Furthermore, the particular agendas of those involved may mean that fiction becomes worse than reality.  As will be seen below, the mini-series now before the Court is a prime example of this possibility.  Finally, the fact a docudrama is being shown on television, perhaps at prime time, accentuates its overall potential influence.  Television is in many ways more powerful than print.  Few would argue that vivid images are often more firmly etched in memory than even the best prose.  All of these factors  


page 931

serve to demonstrate that the potential of docudramas to influence prospective jurors may be significant.  Much will depend, however, on the particular facts of each case.
     Analysing publication and broadcast bans through the prism of s. 1  is a useful analytical exercise, but in doing so I do not wish to be taken as laying out a rigid process which lower courts must follow.  The essence of the decision to issue a ban or not is a balancing of various factors to determine whether such a preventive measure is a necessary and reasonable response to the facts of any given case.  Thus the trial judge must consider the nature of the threat to the fairness of the trial, including the susceptibility of juries to being influenced, the extent of the restriction on freedom of expression and the availability of alternative measures.

Though there is a tendency in post facto assessments to say trials were either fair or not, the determination of whether to take preventive measures is by its very nature neither black nor white.  The balancing which underpins the decision to order or refuse a ban is necessarily an imprecise science.  Judges approaching such decisions either at first instance or at a review stage should keep this reality in mind.
     Appellate review of such findings must therefore respect the discretion accorded to trial judges.  The findings as to whether there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial process is a question of mixed fact and law.  If the trial judge uses the correct standard and applies it in a reasonable manner, then an appellate court should not overturn the decision.  The crucial question is whether the finding was arbitrary or whether there is a basis for it in the evidence.  If there is a basis in the evidence for the conclusion, then deference  


page 932

will be in order even though the appellate court might not have arrived at the same result.
     The preceding discussion can be usefully summarized in the following general points.  Publication and broadcast bans can be ordered to protect the fairness of a pending or current trial.  These bans should be seen as possible complements to other measures available to guarantee the fairness of the trial process.  The fact such bans restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the press means that they should be imposed only in exceptional cases.  Trial judges should carefully consider the alternative measures available since they have the advantage of not restricting freedom of expression and freedom of the press.  It is not necessary, however, for the trial judge to determine with certainty that the alternative measures would be insufficient to protect the fairness of the trial.  What is required is that the trial judge be satisfied that the publication will create a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial, which available alternative measures will not prevent.  The Anglo-Canadian tradition, as distinct from the American, allows greater scope for prophylactic measures.  Consistent with this tradition and the distinct balance between the fundamental rights it implies, trial judges will possess an important discretion to issue publication and broadcast bans.  In the special case of docudramas, the impairment of freedom of expression where a judge issues a temporary broadcast ban may well be minimal in comparison to the risk which such productions represent to the right to a fair trial.  A judge may thus be fully justified in issuing a temporary ban where the surrounding circumstances and the nature of the publication create a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial.  As the Chief Justice has noted, where circumstances permit it is desirable for the trial judge to review the proposed publication as part of the evidence before determining whether to issue a ban.  Finally, the decision of a trial judge, made after weighing all the factors, should not be interfered with unless it is based on an error in principle or it cannot be reasonably supported on the evidence.  Mere disagreement with her/his conclusion is not enough.  With these general  


page 933

principles in mind, I turn to the specific facts of this case.
     2.  Applying the General Principles to the Facts of this Case
     Perhaps the best way to understand the facts of the case on appeal is through the affidavits which were before Gotlib J.  The affidavit of Ronald F. Caza in support of the application for a broadcast ban provided the judge with an overview of the two-part mini-series.  Mr. Caza viewed the film at a special screening organized by the National Film Board (""NFB"").  At that time and when he gave affidavit evidence, Mr. Caza was retained by the Brothers of the Christian Schools of Ottawa.  The following excerpts usefully summarize the content of the mini-series:
     3.  The film is divided into two parts.  The first part covers a certain time period during which physical and sexual abuse is inflicted upon children residing in an orphanage run by a lay religion order of brothers.  The second part takes place 15 years later, when a brother and a former brother undergo criminal trials and a public inquiry looks into allegations of a cover-up at the orphanage.
     . . .
     10.  In the film, it seems that the majority of the brothers are abusing the children.  In fact, there only seems to be one brother who is not abusing the children and he is seemingly intimidated by the other brothers. . . .
     . . .
     12.  In the second part of the film, the audience witnesses the trials of the superintendent and another brother.  The lawyers representing the brother and former brother are portrayed as being cruel and insensitive.  They are also portrayed as treating the victims in a seemingly heartless and unnecessary manner.
     . . .
     15.  Because the audience has witnessed all of the actual physical and sexual assaults, the contentions of the defence lawyers seem ridiculous and misleading.  The  


page 934

audience is left with the feeling that the victims, no matter what problems there may be with their testimony, should be believed because all of their problems are due to the abuse inflicted upon them by the brothers.
     Mr. Caza's general view of the mini-series was echoed in an article entitled ""Film gives voice to abuse victims"" published in the Toronto Star on 29 November 1992.  A copy of this article was attached as an exhibit to the affidavit of Angelo S. Callegari in support of the application.  The article demonstrates poignantly the relevance of the mini-series to the trials of the respondents (at p. H1):
     Yes, it's the Mount Cashel saga, with echoes of other cases recently prosecuted in Ontario, in Canada's Western provinces, and in the United States.  Direct references are thinly veiled, and Smith and his producers at the NFB and CBC are careful to include a disclaimer assuring viewers that this is not a re-enactment of any specific series of events, nor a portrayal of real people.
     Each of those cases was so similar, however, even to the degree of government disinterest in legitimate complaints, that they are almost interchangeable.  Given recent revelations, The Boys of St. Vincent takes on the semblance of a modern morality play; its plot points and characters are ubiquitous, almost part of contemporary folk lore.
     The CBC did not seek to cross-examine in respect of these two affidavits nor did they request that Gotlib J. view the mini-series.  The CBC relied on a single affidavit in opposing the application.  The essence of the CBC's response to the application as reflected in the affidavit of Michael Hughes was that the mini-series was not about the respondents and that by setting the series in Newfoundland there was no risk of confusion.  This assertion, however, stands in stark contrast to the disclaimer which appeared at the beginning of the film and which explained that though the series was not a reenactment of any actual event, it was ""inspired by recent events in Newfoundland and elsewhere in Canada"".  Mr. Hughes went on to explain, referring to the briefing note from the NFB, that ""THE BOYS OF ST. VINCENT reflects a national issue currently receiving widespread media attention,  


page 935

and is intended to help bring the public to better understand this very serious issue of sexual abuse"".  Finally, Mr. Hughes pointed to the losses which CBC would suffer if the broadcast ban was granted.  These damages included approximately $600,000 in lost advertising revenues and expenditures.
     Gotlib J. noted that the four charges involved ""a highly explosive and inflammatory issue to be decided by, in effect, four separate juries in four separate courts"" and that there had ""already been widespread publicity"".  She saw no reason ""to add fuel to the fire"", given the imminence of the three remaining trials and the fact that they would be finished by the fall of 1993, some eight months later.  Gotlib J. rejected the alternative remedies proposed by the CBC stating that they begged the question.  Finally, she concluded:
     In all, I am satisfied that the harm that would be caused by the showing of this particular film before the jury trials of the three remaining accused persons would be such that",1994-12-08 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

                   The following is
the judgment delivered by

 

                   The
Court -- We are all of
the view that this appeal as of right should be dismissed.  The trial judge
found that the affidavit material presented to the authorizing judge contained
an error of non-disclosure relating to the retraction of Eric Lortie, a failure
to state his age, and an error in including him as a target and accomplice. 
Having found such errors, the trial judge proceeded to vitiate the wiretap
authorization finding that the police officer deliberately misled the
authorizing judge.  In so doing, the trial judge fell into error.

 

I.                 As stated in R. v. Garofoli,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, errors in the information presented to the authorizing
judge, whether advertent or even fraudulent, are only factors to be considered
in deciding to set aside the authorization and do not by themselves lead to
automatic vitiation of the wiretap authorization as was done by the trial
judge.  The trial judge should have examined the information in the affidavit
which was independent of the evidence concerning Eric Lortie in order to
determine whether, in light of his finding, there was sufficient reliable
information to support an authorization.  Proulx J.A., writing for the
Quebec Court of Appeal, [1994] R.J.Q. 308, 87 C.C.C. (3d) 440, 60 Q.A.C. 173, carefully
reviewed and analyzed the affidavit after excluding the paragraphs directly
affected by the retraction.  On the basis of this analysis, we are satisfied
that there was sufficient independently verifiable information which was not
affected by the trial judge's finding and upon which an authorization could
reasonably be based.

 

II.                The appeal is therefore
dismissed.

                   The accused and three of his
friends were involved in a fight with two men.  In the course of the fight, one
of the youths pulled a knife and stabbed one of the men in the chest and killed
him.  The four youths immediately fled the scene.  About two weeks later, the
accused's friends were interviewed separately by the police.  Each was
accompanied by a parent and in one case by a lawyer and each was advised of his
right to counsel.  It was also made clear that they were under no obligation to
answer the questions and that they were not ""at this time"" charged
with any offence.  With the youths' consent the interviews were videotaped.  In
their statements, they told the police that the accused had made statements to
them in which he acknowledged that he thought he had caused the death of the
victim by the use of a knife.  The accused was charged with second degree
murder and tried in Youth Court.  At trial, the three youths recanted their
earlier statements and, during the Crown's cross‑examination pursuant to
s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act , they stated they had lied to the
police to exculpate themselves from possible involvement.  Although the trial
judge had no doubt that the recantations were false, the witnesses' prior
inconsistent statements could not be tendered as proof that the accused
actually made the admissions.  Under the traditional common law position, they
could only be used to impeach the witnesses' credibility.  In the absence of
other sufficient identification evidence, the trial judge acquitted the accused
and the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal.  Prior to the hearing in this Court,
the three witnesses pleaded guilty to perjury as a result of their testimony at
trial.  In this appeal, the Crown asks this Court to reconsider the common law
rule which limits the use of prior inconsistent statements to impeaching the
credibility of the witness.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka, Gonthier, McLachlin
and Iacobucci JJ.:  The time has come for the rule limiting the use
of prior inconsistent statements to impeaching the credibility of the witness
(the ""orthodox rule"") to be replaced by a new rule recognizing the
changed means and methods of proof in modern society.  The history of the
orthodox rule demonstrates that it has not enjoyed consistent or unqualified
support.  Considering a change to the orthodox rule is not a matter better left
to Parliament; the rule itself is judge‑made and lends itself to judicial
reform, and it is a natural and incremental progression in the development of
the law of hearsay in Canada by this Court.  The guidelines which direct this
Court's exercise of its jurisdiction to overrule its previous decisions
adopting the orthodox rule do not suggest that it should do anything other than
what it thinks best in reconsidering the orthodox rule:  a reformed rule would
not violate the Charter, the existing rule has been attenuated by
developments in the law of hearsay and is somewhat, if not overly, technical,
and reforming the rule would not directly expand the scope of criminal
liability.

 

                   A reformed rule must carefully
balance the accused's interests in a criminal trial with the interests of
society in seeing justice done.  Since the orthodox rule is an incarnation of
the hearsay rule, a reformed rule must also deal with the ""hearsay
dangers"" of admitting prior inconsistent statements for the truth of their
contents ‑‑ namely, the absence of an oath or solemn affirmation
when the statement was made, the inability of the trier of fact to assess the
demeanour, and therefore the credibility, of the declarant when the statement
was made, and the lack of contemporaneous cross‑examination by the
opponent.

 

                   Following this Court's
decisions in Khan and Smith, evidence of prior inconsistent
statements of a witness other than an accused should be substantively
admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the
reliability of the evidence and its necessity.  These criteria, however, must
be adapted to the present context.  As a threshold matter, the prior
inconsistent statements will only be admissible if they would have been
admissible as the witness's sole testimony, lest what would be excluded as the
witness's primary evidence be admitted under the reformed rule simply because
the witness has recanted.

 

                   The focus of the inquiry in
the case of prior inconsistent statements is on the comparative reliability of
the prior statement and the testimony offered at trial.  Additional indicia and
guarantees of reliability to those outlined in Khan and Smith
must thus be secured in order to bring the prior statement to a comparable
standard of reliability before such statements are admitted as substantive
evidence.  In this context, the absence of an oath and the inability of the
trier of fact to assess the declarant's demeanour are the only ""hearsay
dangers"" which present real concerns.  The criterion of reliability will
therefore be satisfied when the circumstances in which the prior statement was
made provide sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness with respect to these
two dangers.

 

                   There will be sufficient circumstantial
guarantees of reliability to allow the jury to make substantive use of the
statement:  (1) if the statement is made under oath, solemn affirmation or
solemn declaration following an explicit warning to the witness as to the
existence of severe criminal sanctions for the making of a false statement;
(2) if the statement is videotaped in its entirety; and (3) if the
opposing party, whether the Crown or the defence, has a full opportunity to
cross‑examine the witness at trial respecting the statement. 
Alternatively, other circumstantial guarantees of reliability may suffice to
render such statements substantively admissible, provided that the judge is
satisfied that the circumstances provide adequate assurances of reliability in
place of those which the hearsay rule traditionally requires.  With the oath,
solemn affirmation or solemn declaration and the warning, the first
""hearsay danger"" is satisfied.  The witness is clearly made aware of
the gravity of the situation and his duty to tell the truth.  The presence of
an oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration also increases the
evidentiary value of the statement when it is admitted at trial.  The trier of
fact will have the opportunity to choose between two sworn statements and will
not be asked to accept unsworn testimony over sworn testimony, or to render a
verdict based on unsworn testimony.  While it is true that the oath in itself
has no power to ensure truthfulness in some witnesses, the fact that both
statements were made under oath removes resort to the absence of an oath as an
indicium of the alleged unreliability of the prior inconsistent statement. 
With a videotaped statement, the second ""hearsay danger"" is also
satisfied.  The indicia of credibility, and therefore reliability, are available
to the trier of fact.  Not only does the trier have access to the full range of
non‑verbal indicia of credibility, but there is also a reproduction of
the statement which is fully accurate, eliminating the danger of inaccurate
recounting.  In a very real sense, the evidence ceases to be hearsay, since the
declarant is brought before the trier of fact.  Finally, while a cross‑examination
of the witness at trial does not satisfy entirely the absence of
contemporaneous cross‑examination, given the other guarantees of
trustworthiness, the third ""hearsay danger"" is not a sufficient
reason to exclude the statement from the jury as substantive evidence.  The
practical difficulties in requiring contemporaneous cross‑examination tip
the balance in favour of allowing cross‑examination at trial to serve as
a substitute.

 

                   Unavailability is not an
indispensable condition of necessity.  The criterion of necessity must be given
a flexible definition, capable of encompassing diverse situations.  In the case
of prior inconsistent statements, evidence of the same value cannot be expected
from the recanting witness or other sources.  Where a sufficient degree of
reliability is established, the trier of fact should be allowed to weigh both
statements in light of the witness's explanation for the change.

 

                   When a party gives notice that
it will seek to make substantive use of a prior statement, the trial judge must
on the voir dire held under s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act 
satisfy himself that the indicia of reliability necessary to admit hearsay
evidence of prior statements are present and genuine.  If they are, he must
then examine the circumstances under which the statement was obtained, to
satisfy himself that the statement supported by the indicia of reliability was
made voluntarily if to a person in authority, and that there are no other
factors which would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute
if the statement was admitted as substantive evidence.  In most cases, as in
this case, the party seeking to admit the prior inconsistent statement as
substantive evidence will have to establish that these requirements have been
satisfied on a balance of probabilities.  The trial judge is not to decide
whether the prior inconsistent statement is true, or more reliable than the
present testimony, as that is a matter for the trier of fact.  Once this
process is complete, and all of its constituent elements satisfied, the trial
judge need not issue the standard limiting instruction to the jury, but may
instead tell the jury that they may take the statement as substantive evidence
of its content, or, if he is sitting alone, make substantive use of the
statement, giving the evidence the appropriate weight after taking into account
all of the circumstances.  In either case, the trial judge must direct the
trier of fact to consider carefully these circumstances in assessing the
credibility of the prior inconsistent statement relative to the witness's
testimony at trial.  Where the prior statement does not have the necessary
circumstantial guarantees of reliability, and so cannot pass the threshold test
on the voir dire, but the party tendering the prior statement otherwise
satisfies the requirements of s. 9(1)  or (2)  of the Canada Evidence Act ,
the statement may still be tendered into evidence, but the trial judge must
instruct the jury in the terms of the orthodox rule.

 

                   In this case, while the
statements of the recanting witnesses were videotaped, and the accused's
counsel had a full opportunity to cross‑examine the witnesses at trial,
the statements were not made under oath, solemn affirmation or by a solemn
declaration.  Considering himself bound by the orthodox rule, the trial judge
refused to consider the admissibility of the statements.  Given his expressed belief
that the witnesses were lying at trial, it is possible that he might have found
sufficient indicia of reliability to admit the statements as substantive
evidence.  A new trial should be ordered at which the reformed rule relating to
prior inconsistent statements will, if necessary, be applied by the trial
judge, who will decide whether sufficient indicia of reliability and necessity
are present in this case, and instruct the trier of fact to afford the prior
statements the appropriate weight in reaching a verdict.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and Cory JJ.: While
the rule against the substantive use of prior statements should be changed, the
administering of an oath or solemn affirmation should not be regarded as an
essential safeguard for ensuring the veracity of a statement.  Neither the
taking of the oath nor the possibility of imprisonment arising from perjury
charges resulting from testimony at trial can in themselves ensure that a
witness will tell the truth.  It is the reliability that can be placed upon the
statement that should determine its admissibility. That reliability will depend
on a number of factors, among others, whether the witness giving the statement
is subject to criminal prosecution for making a deliberately false statement. 
The less stringent requirements for prosecution for offences like obstructing
justice, fabricating evidence or public mischief, which, unlike perjury, do not
require corroboration, and the more frequent prosecutions for these offences
would have a better deterrent effect upon those who might be prone to make
false statements.  A requirement that the police administer an oath to the
witness cannot further deter the witness from lying and seems to be
superfluous.  Liability for these offences does not rest in any way on the oath
and a witness cannot be found guilty of perjury arising from a sworn
declaration made in the course of a criminal investigation.  The absence of the
oath should thus not presumptively stand in the way of the admissibility for
substantive purposes of a prior inconsistent statement. Although it would be
preferable to give a warning to a witness of the possibility of criminal
proceedings if that person gives a false statement, it may not be essential to
give such a warning in order to render the statement admissible.  Canadians are
well aware and indeed expect that witnesses who make deliberately false
statements to the police would be subject to criminal prosecution.

 

                    A videotaped statement with
its complete and comprehensive record of the questions posed, the answers given
and the demeanour of the witness, will often serve as a complete answer to the
issues of reliability and voluntariness of the statement. It is not essential,
however, that a statement be videotaped in order to be admissible. Where a complete
and comprehensive record of the statement is preserved together with
satisfactory evidence of the circumstances of the interview and the demeanour
of the witness all the requirements on this count will be met.  If the prior
statement, while not videotaped, meets all the criteria of reliability it
should be admissible.

 

                   While at the time the
statement was made the witness was not subjected to the rigours of cross‑examination,
if the prior statement is ruled admissible then the witness will be subject to
cross‑examination at trial where the trier of fact will be able to study
the witness's demeanour throughout his testimony and to assess what weight, if
any, should be attached to all the evidence of the witness including the prior
statement.  The opposing party, whether the Crown or the defence, will also be
able to explore the witness's reasons for the court room recantation and the
veracity of his testimony.

 

                   A prior inconsistent statement
should be admitted for all purposes if upon a voir dire the trial judge
is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the following conditions are met: 
(1) the evidence contained in the prior statement is such that it would be
admissible if given in court; (2) the statement has been made voluntarily
by the witness and is not the result of any undue pressure, threats or
inducements; (3) the statement was made in circumstances, which viewed
objectively would bring home to the witness the importance of telling the
truth; (4) that the statement is reliable in that it has been fully and
accurately transcribed or recorded; and (5) the statement was made in
circumstances that the witness would be liable to criminal prosecution for
giving a deliberately false statement. 

 

                   If at the conclusion of the voir
dire the prior inconsistent statement is ruled admissible for all purposes
then, at some time, the trial judge should advise the jury that, although the
statement has been ruled admissible, it is up to them to decide what weight, if
any, they should attach to it. In assessing the statement, the jury should take
into account all the circumstances in which it was made and should be
instructed that they may consider that the statement should be given less
weight because it was not subject to cross‑examination at the time it was
made and because there was not the same opportunity to assess the demeanour of
the witness as there would have been had the statement been made in court.

 

                   In this case, an analysis of
the conditions of admissibility indicates that it would be open to a judge
conducting a voir dire at a new trial to find that the prior
inconsistent statements met all the conditions for admissibility.

 

                   The Khan and Smith
approach to hearsay evidence provides an alternative justification for changing
the interpretation of s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act  as long as
the threshold tests for reliability set out above are made a part of this
approach.

                   The judgment of Lamer C.J. and
Sopinka, Gonthier, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. was delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- The issue in this appeal is
the substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent statements by a witness
other than an accused.  The Crown asks this Court to reconsider the common law
rule which limits the use of such statements to impeaching the credibility of
the witness.  In my opinion, the time has come for the orthodox rule to be
replaced by a new rule recognizing the changed means and methods of proof in
modern society.

 

I - The Facts

 

                   On April 24, 1988, Joseph
Wright and his brother Steven got off a bus at an intersection in Scarborough,
Ontario.  The brothers crossed the street and began walking home.  At about the
same time, the respondent and three other young men were driving past the same
intersection.  An argument started between the group in the car and the two men
on the street and shortly thereafter a fight occurred.  The brothers were
unarmed.  In the course of the fight one of the four persons from the vehicle
pulled a knife, slashing twice at Joseph's face and then stabbing him in the
chest.  The stab wound to the chest penetrated Joseph's heart and killed him. 
The four young men then fled the scene.

 

                   About two weeks later, the
three young men involved with the respondent in the incident were interviewed
separately by the police.  While the appellant states that the three witnesses
approached the police to make their statements, the respondent notes that two
of the witnesses testified that they approached the police only after the
police came to their homes in connection with the police investigation of the
killing, and the third witness testified that it was his mother's idea that he
give a statement to the police.  Each was accompanied by a parent and in one
case by a lawyer and each was advised of his right to counsel.  It was also
made clear that they were under no obligation to answer questions put to them
by the police, and while the police told the witnesses that they were not
charged with any offence, the interviewers also added the qualification
""at this time"" in two of the interviews.  With the youths' consent
the interviews were videotaped.

 

                   In their statements, the three
young men told the police that the respondent had made statements to them in
which he acknowledged that he thought he had, or had, caused the death of the
deceased by the use of a knife.  The respondent was charged with second degree
murder and he entered a plea of not guilty.  Following an unsuccessful attempt
by the Crown to have the case transferred to adult court, the respondent's
trial commenced before Judge MacDonnell in Youth Court on November 14, 1989.

 

                   When called at trial by the
Crown, the three young men refused to adopt their earlier statements respecting
the admissions made by the respondent.  The trial judge allowed the Crown to
cross-examine them on their prior statements pursuant to s. 9  of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-5 .  They admitted they had made the
statements to the police but said that they had lied to the police and that the
respondent had not in fact made the incriminating statements that they had
previously attributed to him.  Their explanation for having lied to the police
was that they did so to exculpate themselves from possible involvement.  They
claimed to have either forgotten what occurred when the respondent was alleged
to have made his inculpatory statements, or to have not heard the respondent.

 

                   The trial judge held that the
only use that could be made of the prior inconsistent statements of the three
witnesses was with respect to their credibility, and that the prior
inconsistent statements could not be used as evidence of the truth of the
matters stated therein; that is, they could not be tendered as proof that the
respondent actually made the admissions.  The only other evidence of the
identity of the assailant was identification evidence provided by the victim's
brother, who identified the accused at trial (in a ""dock""
identification with little evidential value) and testified as to the appearance
of the deceased's assailant.  The trial judge found that the dock
identification was ""naked opinion given 19 months after the event"",
and that the brother had only a poor opportunity to observe his brother's
attacker.  Doubts also existed in connection with his latter evidence because
of several inconsistencies between elements of his description of the attacker
shortly after the incident and elements of his description at trial,
including:  the type of jacket and pants worn by the assailant, the clothing of
the other youths, and the height and weight of the assailant relative to the
other youths.  At trial, the respondent argues, several other elements of the
brother's description did not match the respondent's characteristics,
including:  the colour of the respondent's skin relative to the other youths,
the fact that the assailant held the knife in his right hand while the
respondent was described as left-handed by two of the recanting witnesses,
whether the assailant wore jewellery, and the colour of the assailant's hair.

 

                   As a result of the doubt which
existed with respect to the issue of identification, and in the absence of
other admissible evidence, the trial judge acquitted the respondent.

 

                   The appellant appealed the
acquittal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which stated that it was bound by
the decisions of this Court, and accordingly dismissed the appeal.

 

                   Between the filing of the
parties' facta and the hearing of this appeal, the three witnesses pleaded
guilty to perjury.  The Crown brought a motion on the day of oral argument in
this appeal to adduce this new evidence which it asserted was relevant to two
issues:  (i) whether the operation of a revised rule would tend to enhance or detract
from the public's perception of and respect for the administration of justice,
and (ii) whether the application of the orthodox rule had caused a miscarriage
of justice in this case.  Counsel for the respondent consented to the admission
of this fresh evidence on this basis and for this purpose alone, and not as
evidence of the respondent's innocence or guilt.  Counsel for the Crown agreed
to this limitation.

 

II - Judgments Below

 

Youth Court

 

                   Judge MacDonnell first
assessed the evidence with respect to the events which led up to Joseph
Wright's death and found that the victim's brother essentially told the truth
regarding the sequence of events preceding and during the fight.  He rejected
the evidence of the three young men who were present in the car with the
respondent.  Judge MacDonnell held:

 

... those three
witnesses were obviously and deliberately untruthful in their sworn evidence
before me with respect to material matters.  Their account of how this fight
occurred is not only at odds with the evidence of Steven Wright, Sean Dowling
and in my opinion, Ruth Kazan [two independent witnesses], it is at odds with
common sense.

 

                   Judge MacDonnell next
considered whether the Crown had proved that the person who used the knife was
the respondent.  In this regard, the judge found that the identification
evidence of the victim's brother was weak and could not, standing by itself,
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was the person with the
knife.  Judge MacDonnell was also of the opinion that there was no
circumstantial evidence supporting this identification evidence.  With respect
to the respondent's friends' statements to the police that the respondent
admitted to using the knife in the fight with Joseph Wright, Judge MacDonnell held
that he was precluded from considering these statements as evidence that the
respondent made those admissions.  As to their testimony given at trial, the
judge was of the view that the three witnesses lied under oath.  He stated that
he disbelieved their testimony ""based on my assessment of the entirety of
the content of their testimony and, very importantly, the manner in which it
was given.  With respect to the latter point, in my opinion they were anything
but forthright.""  He concluded on this point:

 

In my opinion,
each of these three witnesses lied to me with respect to having lied to the
police about what the accused said to them.  I have no doubt that their
recantations are false.  That is, I have no doubt that on this point they were
telling the police the truth as they knew it about what the accused said.  That
finding is not necessarily the same as a finding that the accused made the
admissions, but it is tantamount to that finding.

 

Judge MacDonnell reluctantly followed, however,
the traditional common law position that the only use that could be made of the
prior inconsistent statements of a witness other than an accused which the
witness does not adopt was to impeach his credibility.  The judge refused to
apply the reasoning of Estey J., concurring in the result in McInroy v. The
Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 588, which would expand significantly the use to be
made of unadopted prior inconsistent statements.

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 49 O.A.C. 30

 

                   The Ontario Court of Appeal
refused to reconsider the present validity of the common law rule as to the use
of prior inconsistent statements, rejecting the appellant's submission that in
the particular circumstances of this case the premises upon which the rule was
founded were not applicable.  The court held (at p. 32):

 

                   That
prior inconsistent statements of a witness may only be used in assessing the
credibility of a witness, and may not be used as evidence of the truth of the
matters stated therein, is a principle of criminal law in Canada of long
standing which was recognized in Deacon v. The King [[1947] S.C.R.
531].  In R. v. Mannion [[1986] 2 S.C.R. 272], the rule was restated by
the Supreme Court of Canada.  In that case, the court was invited to review the
rule so as to make admissible as evidence of their contents such past
contradictory statements by nonparty witnesses where it is shown that they had
been made under oath and subject to cross-examination, but the court found it
unnecessary to deal with that issue.  In Corbett v. The Queen [[1988] 1
S.C.R. 670], the rule was again restated, and more recently in R. v. Kuldip
[[1990] 3 S.C.R. 618], a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, released
December 7, 1990, the principle appears to have been once again reaffirmed.

 

                   The court concluded that it
was bound by the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada and that it was
inappropriate for it to review the traditional rule.  Therefore, it dismissed
the appeal.

 

III - Grounds for Appeal

 

                   The Crown now appeals to this
Court on the following ground:  whether the Ontario Court of Appeal erred in
law when it held that the learned trial judge did not err in law when he held
that the prior inconsistent statements of several witnesses could not be used
as evidence of the facts alleged in the statements.  In urging this Court to
reconsider or refrain from reconsidering the orthodox rule, the parties also
addressed the issues of stare decisis and whether the change in the law
proposed by the appellant should be made by Parliament rather than this Court.

 

IV - Analysis

 

A.  History and Development of the Orthodox
Rule

 

                   In his reasons in McInroy,
supra, Estey J. traced the origins of the orthodox rule that prior
inconsistent statements are admissible only to impeach the credibility of a
witness, and not as evidence of the truth of their contents.  The rule was
first stated by Denman C.J. in Wright v. Beckett (1833), 1 M. & Rob.
414, 174 E.R. 143, at p. 145 E.R.:

 

                   The
other danger [of permitting cross-examination of a witness found to be hostile
by the party which called the witness] is, that the statement, which is
admissible only to contradict the witness, may be taken as substantive proof in
the cause.  But this danger equally arises from the contradiction of an adverse
witness:  it is met by the Judge pointing out the distinction to the jury, and
warning them not to be misled.  It is not so abstruse but that Judges may
explain it, and juries perceive its reasonableness; and it is probable that
they most commonly discard entirely the evidence of him who has stated
falsehoods, whether sworn or unsworn.

 

Estey J. noted that courts continued to apply
this rule after the enactment of The Common Law Procedure Act, 1854
(U.K.), 17 & 18 Vict., c. 125, s. 22, and its criminal law parallel in S.C.
1869, c. 29, s. 68, which have survived in s. 9(1)  of the Canada Evidence
Act .  However, Estey J. also observed that the rule was not unchallenged in
the 19th century.  In Attorney General v. Hitchcock (1847), 16 L.J. Ex.
259, at p. 261, Pollock C.B., Parke B. concurring, said:

 

If you ask a
witness whether he has not made a certain statement which would be material,
and opposed to part of his testimony, you may then call witnesses to prove that
he has made the statement, and the jury are at liberty to believe either the
one account or the other.

 

                   The debate over the merits of
the orthodox rule continued into the 20th century in decisions like R. v.
Duckworth (1916), 26 C.C.C. 314 (Ont. S.C., App. Div.), in which the court
affirmed the orthodox rule of limited admissibility by a 4 to 1 margin.  For
the majority, Clute J. characterized the Crown's suggestion that evidence of
prior inconsistent statements by Crown witnesses who recanted should be
substantively admissible as (at p. 324) a rather ""startling proposition
and one to which I cannot accede except upon the clearest authority.  None has
been cited.""   Clute J. further said of s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1906, c. 145, that (at p. 329):

 

This section
was passed not to admit what was not evidence, but for the purpose of
contradiction.  It does not provide that what was not otherwise evidence
becomes evidence by the section, but simply that, before the party can be
contradicted, the witness must, in the opinion of the Court, prove adverse. . .
.

 

Riddell J. concurred, relying however on an
edition of Wigmore on Evidence which predated the introduction of
criticism of the orthodox rule in that work.  Masten J. joined the majority,
although only reluctantly since he doubted the ability of the jury member to
follow the judge's limiting instructions (at p. 353):

 

Assume that he
reaches the conclusion that the testimony now being given at the trial is
false, and that the earlier statement is true.  The duty of the juryman then is
to disregard the evidence given by the witness at the trial, as being false
testimony.  But, having reached that conclusion, and having struck from his
mind the testimony of the witness, he must then proceed to obliterate as well
the statement given by the witness on the previous occasion, which he has just
concluded a moment before to be true.  Is that humanly possible?

 

In declining to follow the orthodox rule,
Meredith C.J.C.P. (at p. 359) asserted that ""[c]ases decided in the dark
ages of the law of evidence, when, among other strange things, a party was not
at liberty to discredit his own witness, cannot be very helpful for any purpose
in these days, in this Province....""  Meredith C.J.C.P. continued at p.
360:

 

                   And
I hold that, if he [the trial judge] had told them [the jury] that, if from
anything said by the witnesses at the trial and from their demeanour, they
found that their statements on the former occasion were true, then such
statements would be evidence at the trial, evidence from the witnesses' own lips,
as the Judge put it, as well as from that other test of truthfulness, their
demeanour.

 

                   This Court first adopted the
orthodox rule in Deacon v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 531, and, unlike the
court in Duckworth, was unanimous on the point.  However, both Kerwin J.
and Rand J. exhibited a strong awareness of the arguments against the orthodox
rule.  Kerwin J. (for Rinfret C.J., Taschereau and Estey JJ.) held at p. 534
that the fact that a sketch made by a witness which contradicted her present
testimony, was made an exhibit,

 

does not take
the exhibit out of the category of something merely going to the credibility of
the witness and raise it to the status of something that as against the accused
is to be taken as evidence of the truth of the statements contained in the
writing.  A contrary proposition would be entirely foreign to our criminal law.

 

Rand J. concurred (at pp. 537-38):

 

                   That
such statements generally are limited to credibility and cannot be used as
evidence of the truth of the facts to which they relate, is well
established....  It is quite true that it may be difficult to dissociate the
matters of such statements from the facts brought before the jury by the
witness and to nullify the influence they may have on the minds of the jurors
in dealing with the evidence as a whole; but anything short of this would
expose a person to a fabricated account of events, too dangerous to risk.  But
the whole field of cross-examination, in the discretion of the court, is opened
and the matters of the statement can thus be brought within the test of the
testimonial response of the witness.  This might be taken as a reason for
leaving all the facts, including the statement, to the consideration of the
jury, but the long experience of the courts is against it.

 

                   The first, and only, hint of
contention respecting the orthodox rule in this Court was in the reasons of
Estey J. in McInroy.

 

                   In McInroy, a Crown
witness had made a statement to the police in connection with the appellant
McInroy's trial for murder, claiming that the appellant had admitted killing
the victim and being paid to do so.  At trial, the witness claimed to not
remember making the statement.  The Crown applied under s. 9(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  to cross-examine the witness on her prior inconsistent
statement, and a voir dire was held.  When confronted with her written
statement, the witness persisted in her claim not to remember any of the
matters contained within it.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge
carefully stated the orthodox rule:

 

... I repeat
that in light of her continued inability to remember those questions and
answers, they do not form part of her evidence and accordingly are not to be
taken as evidence of the truth of what is contained therein, but are only to be
considered by you in testing or determining her credibility as a witness.

 

                   The British Columbia Court of
Appeal, [1977] 4 W.W.R. 734, held that the trial judge had erred in permitting
Crown counsel to cross-examine the witness as an adverse witness, since her credibility
was not in issue and she ""had testified to nothing damaging to the Crown's
case"" (p. 742).

 

                   The Supreme Court of Canada
allowed the Crown's appeal.  Martland J. (Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Beetz and
Pratte JJ. concurring) held that the Court of Appeal had misconstrued s. 9(2) 
as requiring the witness to be adverse, when in fact all the trial judge was
required to do under the section was to determine whether the previous
statement in writing or reduced to writing was in fact inconsistent with the
witness's present testimony.  Martland J. was of the opinion that there was a
clear inconsistency in the witness's testimony and that the trial judge had
correctly exercised his discretion.  Furthermore, Martland J. noted (at p. 605)
that ""[t]he trial judge was careful to explain ... the limited extent to
which that cross-examination might be considered by the jury.""

 

                   Estey J. differed in his
attitude towards the orthodox rule.  He wrote (at pp. 606-7):

 

It is in my
respectful view both an error in law and an offence against common sense to
instruct the jury that the witness's prior statement, particularly when given
in the circumstances of this case, may be considered by the jury only on the
issue as to credibility of the witness, St. Germaine, and must be disregarded
on the issues of fact arising in this statement; and, more precisely, that the
jury must be told that the prior statement may not be considered by them as
proof or even as some evidence relating to the matters asserted in that
statement.

 

                   Estey J. noted that the only
basis for excluding the relevant evidence of St. Germaine's prior statement (and
the admissions of the accused it reported) was the hearsay rule, but that in
the case of prior inconsistent statements (at p. 614) ""the speaker of the
`hearsay' is indeed in the witness box available for cross-examination and
subject to the scrutiny of the trier of fact"".  He then canvassed
authorities criticizing the orthodox rule on various bases, including the
difficulty of applying the distinction between permissible and impermissible
uses of evidence of the prior statement, the fact that if a witness contradicts
his or her evidence in chief during cross-examination, both versions may be
considered to ascertain the truth, and that the circumstances at trial mean
there is no real reason to classify the statement as hearsay.

 

                   He based his ultimate rejection
of the orthodox rule on the narrower basis of s. 9(2) , however, which he noted
was enacted in 1968, after this Court's decision in Deacon, and which
gave no indication that it was limited to procedural concerns only.  Estey J.
concluded that the proper interpretation of s. 9(2)  was that it permitted the
trier of fact, once the procedural requirements of the section were met, to
take into appreciation all the evidence given by the witness, both in
the prior statement to the police and her testimony at trial.

 

                   Estey J.'s reliance on this
narrow ground to reject the orthodox rule prompted criticism from R. J.
Delisle, who noted in a comment on McInroy ((1978-79), 21 Crim. L.Q.
162, at p. 166) that the departure from the orthodox rule might be welcomed, but
also observed that there were problems inherent in ""the piecemeal nature
of the judicial amendment"" which created anomalies by the different
treatment of evidence admitted under s. 9(1)  and (2) .

 

                   This Court did not take up
Estey J.'s challenge to the orthodox rule, but instead has restated the
orthodox rule in several recent cases, including R. v. Mannion, [1986] 2
S.C.R. 272; R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670; R. v. Kuldip,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 618; R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326; and R.
v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915.  However, it is also important to note that
in none of these cases was the orthodox rule itself directly challenged, as it
has been in this appeal.  Instead, those decisions used the orthodox rule as a
point of comparison, or as the model for a separate rule, as must be addressed
in connection with Kuldip.

 

                   Special attention must be paid
to Kuldip.  In that case, the respondent challenged the use of his
inconsistent testimony from a prior trial to impeach his credibility at his
present trial on the ground that it violated his right under s. 13  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which provides:

 

                   13.  A witness who testifies in any proceedings has
the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate
that witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or
for the giving of contradictory evidence.

 

I held, for the majority, that there was no
violation of s. 13 , since using a prior inconsistent statement from a former
proceeding during cross-examination to impeach the credibility of the accused
only does not thereby incriminate the accused.  If the trial judge charged the
jury respecting the permissible uses of the prior testimony, there would be no
incrimination of the accused by the prior testimony.  My holding in Kuldip
should be understood not as merely restating and applying the orthodox rule,
but as establishing a Charter  rule recognizing the unique circumstances
of compulsion surrounding such statements.  In Dubois v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, I wrote for the majority (at p. 358) that

 

the purpose of
s. 13 , when the section is viewed in the context of s. 11(c) and (d)
[of the Charter ], is to protect individuals from being indirectly
compelled to incriminate themselves, to ensure that the Crown will not be able
to do indirectly that which s. 11 (c) prohibits.

 

Indeed, prior statements made by the accused
would not have been excluded by the orthodox rule because they are admissions,
and substantively admissible under the applicable hearsay exception.  This
reinforces my characterization of the holding in Kuldip as an
independent Charter  rule of evidence, rather than merely an application
of the orthodox rule.

 

                   It must also be remembered
that Kuldip and s. 13  of the Charter  refer to a very special
subset of prior inconsistent statements, in which the prior statement is made
by an accused in a proceeding who testifies at a future proceeding and which,
if admitted for the truth of its contents, would incriminate him in the second
proceeding.  Furthermore, s. 13 applies only to a witness who testifies in a
""proceeding""; while this Court has yet to explore the outer
boundaries of this term, cases decided to date have concentrated on judicial
proceedings such as trials and preliminary inquiries:  see Dubois.  A
police interview, even where the witness makes his or her statement under oath,
may not be a ""proceeding"" for the purposes of s. 13 .  As this precise
issue does not arise in this appeal, I will make no further comments on this
point.

 

                   In the present appeal, and the
more usual course of events, there is no question of incriminating the witness,
who is not the accused, by admitting the prior statement for the truth of its
contents.  In the vast majority of cases where prior inconsistent statements
are adduced, then, s. 13  of the Charter  will not be engaged.  In those
cases where it is the prior inconsistent statement of the accused which is
offered, s. 13  will operate to restrict its use to the purpose of impeaching
credibility only.

 

                   Finally, in Smith, I
explicitly refrained from assessing the impact of the principled approach to
hearsay exceptions on the orthodox rule, since this supplementary ground of
appeal had not been pressed before the Court, and since the conclusion I had
reached in respect of hearsay evidence generally made it unnecessary to decide
this ground.

 

B.  Hearsay Rationale of the Orthodox Rule

 

                   The theoretical basis of the
orthodox rule has been much debated.  S. Schiff, in ""The Previous
Inconsistent Statement of Opponent's Witness"" (1986), 36 U.T.L.J.
440, at p. 451, states that:

 

                   The
orthodox doctrine limiting the trier's use of the non-party witness' statement
rests on the hearsay rule.  While American judges and commentators have taken
this as obvious, Canadian and English judges have rarely discussed the reason
for the limit.

 

The author cites as rare examples of Canadian
judges explicitly recognizing the hearsay rule as the basis of the orthodox
rule the reasons of Riddell J. in Duckworth, and Estey J. in McInroy. 
In Evidence:  Principles and Problems (2nd ed. 1989), at p. 247, R. J.
Delisle also recognized the source of the orthodox rule in the law of hearsay.

 

                   However, it is clear that
commentators addressing the orthodox rule are implicitly relying on the hearsay
concept when they discuss the ""dangers"" of admitting prior
inconsistent statements for their truth, such dangers being the same as the
traditional ""hearsay dangers"":  the absence of an oath or solemn
affirmation when the statement was made, the inability of the trier of fact to
assess the demeanour and therefore the credibility of the declarant when the
statement was made (as well as the trier's inability to ensure that the witness
actually said what is claimed), and the lack of contemporaneous
cross-examination by the opponent.  For examples of commentators who have
explicitly or implicitly justified the orthodox rule on the basis of the
hearsay rule, see J. W. Morden (now Morden A.C.J. of the Ontario Court of
Appeal), ""Evidence -- Proof of Own Witness's Prior Inconsistent Statement
Where ""Adverse"" -- Section 24, Evidence Act (Ont.)"" (1962), 40 Can.
Bar Rev. 96, at p. 103; McCormick on Evidence (4th ed. 1992), vol.
2, at pp. 117-18, and L. Stuesser, ""Admitting Prior Inconsistent
Statements For Their Truth"" (1992), 71 Can. Bar Rev. 48, at p. 53.

 

                   Another indication of the
basis of the orthodox rule in the hearsay rule is the treatment it has received
from law reform bodies.  The Law Reform Commission of Canada's Report on
Evidence (1975) addressed the orthodox rule in that part of its Report
dealing with hearsay, and the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of
Evidence, in its Report (1982), classified prior inconsistent statements
offered for their truth as hearsay (at p. 315) ""out of caution"".

 

                   It is important to understand
the basis and rationale of the orthodox rule in order to understand how this
Court's recent decisions in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, and Smith
have affected the orthodox rule, and to determine what type of principled
analysis this Court should apply to the particular problem of prior
inconsistent statements.

 

C.  Erosion of Orthodox Rule

 

                   (1)  Criticism of the Rule

 

                   The orthodox rule has been
almost universally criticized by academic commentators.  Their criticisms can
be distilled into the assertion that the hearsay dangers on which the orthodox
rule is based are ill-founded or non-existent in the case of prior inconsistent
statements.

 

                   Respecting the oath,
commentators discount the significance of the oath in modern society. 
Stuesser, at pp. 53-54, is representative in arguing that ""[t]he
unfortunate reality in our modern society is that the power of an oath must be
discounted as a means of ensuring reliability for a statement.""  One
critic less reservedly referred to the oath as ""no more than a lingering
relic of primordial superstition"" and ""primitive mumbo-jumbo""
(D. F. Dugdale, ""Against oath-taking"", [1985] N.Z.L.J. 404). 
Furthermore, commentators argue that the witness is under oath at trial when he
or she is asked to adopt or deny the prior statement, thus invoking the power
of the oath at the trial as it relates to the truthfulness of the prior
statement.  However, I note that while the witness faces the legal consequences
of violating an oath or solemn affirmation at trial, in most cases there is
less incentive to be truthful when the statement is made, leading to a natural
preference for the testimony at trial if the alternative is unsworn or
unaffirmed testimony.

 

                   Critics also claim that the
lack of opportunity for the trier of fact to observe the demeanour of the
witness at the time the statement was made, and thus to assess credibility
based on that demeanour, is overstated in its significance.  They argue that
the opportunity to observe the witness as he or she denies or professes not to
remember making the statement can give the trier insight into the truthfulness
of the recantation, and therefore also the truthfulness of the prior statement
which is denied.  This does not obviate the problem of ensuring that the
witness's prior statement is fully and accurately reproduced for the trier of
fact.  Of course, both of these criticisms of the orthodox rule are reinforced
when, as in this case, the prior statement is videotaped, allowing the trier of
fact to observe the witnesses' demeanour and ensuring that an accurate record
of the statement is tendered as evidence.

 

                   In a study for the Law Reform
Commission of Canada, Halton Regional Police Officers in Burlington videotaped
all suspect interviews, where the suspect consented.  Interviewing officers,
court officers, Crown prosecutors and defence counsel were then surveyed to
evaluate the results of this program.  In an interim evaluation one year into
the two-year experiment (A. Grant, ""Videotaping Police Questioning:  a
Canadian Experiment"", [1987] Crim. L.R. 375), the author stated (at
p. 379) that

 

it certainly
does not appear that people are inhibited by the camera or the general
situation from making confessions and inculpatory admissions on videotape to
interviewing police officers.  The audio-visual process appears to record a
much greater range of responses than the written statement.

 

The author noted that both Crown prosecutors and
defence counsel responded favourably to the use of videotapes, if not for the
same reasons, that in most cases no contest arose as to the introduction of the
tape, and that there was no evidence that costly crews or other assistance were
required to create (at p. 383) ""a clear and reliable record of the
interview.""

 

                   The final report reached the
same conclusions.  In ""The Audio-Visual Taping of Police Interviews With
Suspects and Accused Persons by Halton Regional Police Force:  An
Evaluation"" (1988), J. Miller summarized an evaluation paper prepared by
Grant.  She noted (at p. 3) that the case of Paramore v. State, 229
So.2d 855 (1969), in which the Florida Supreme Court upheld the admissibility
of a taped confession, was

 

a milestone not
only for law enforcement practices, but for the administration of justice as a
whole.  For the first time in the history of the criminal justice system the
mysterious veil was lifted and it was now possible to present before the court
the entire contents of a police interrogation in a comprehensive and accurate
manner.

 

The conclusion remained that people were not
inhibited by the camera, and that (at p. 13): ""The courts's ability to
asses the credibility and voluntariness of a statement was seen by the defence
bar as being greatly enhanced by the more complete picture provided by
videotape.""  Furthermore, defence counsel preferred videotaped statements
to police officer's notes and memories to create an accurate record of
statements.  Any prejudice to the accused from being seen as he or she appeared
at the time of the interview was seen by defence counsel to be outweighed by
the accuracy and reliability of the record provided by the videotape.  Indeed,
Miller observed (at p. 17) that ""it is common ground among police, Crown
and defence counsel that the videotape is an accurate record of the interview
as it occurred in the videotaping room.""  Miller concluded (at p. 23):

 

                   Aside
from providing a new tool to the investigative process, the Police, Crown
counsel and defence lawyers viewed the introduction of this technology as an
improvement of the administration of justice.  An accurate videotape record of
police interviews largely eliminates courtroom conflicts over what was said and
how an accused was treated.  The new technology therefore, helps police in
gathering evidence at the same time as it adds to the protection of the rights
of the accused.

 

The ""milestone"" represented by widely
available videotape technology and its introduction in the trial process, then,
has gone a long way towards meeting this second hearsay danger.  I also believe
that demeanour evidence from sources other than a videotape might, in
exceptional circumstances, also serve the same purpose to answer this criticism
of the orthodox rule.

 

                   The lack of cross-examination
is the most important of the hearsay dangers, but perhaps also the most
overstated in the context of prior inconsistent statements.  By definition,
commentators argue, the maker of the statement is present in court and amenable
to vigorous cross-examination respecting his or her recollection, testimonial
capacity and bias at the time of the making of the prior statement.  As it is
argued in McCormick on Evidence, supra, at p. 120:

 

                   The
witness who has told one story aforetime and another today has opened the gates
to all the vistas of truth which the common law practice of cross-examination
and re-examination was invented to explore.  The reasons for the change of
face, whether forgetfulness, carelessness, pity, terror, or greed, may be
explored by the two questioners in the presence of the trier of fact, under
oath, casting light on which is the true story and which the false.

 

Wigmore, vol. 3A (Chadbourn rev. 1970), §1018, at
p. 996, stated that the only ground for excluding prior inconsistent statements
as substantive evidence was the hearsay rule, and continued:

 

But the theory
of the hearsay rule is that an extrajudicial statement is rejected because it
was made out of court by an absent person not subject to cross-examination.... 
Here, however, by hypothesis the witness is present and subject to
cross-examination.  There is ample opportunity to test him as to the basis of
his former statement.  The whole purpose of the hearsay rule has been already
satisfied.

 

Similarly, Morden, supra, wrote of prior
inconsistent statements, at p. 103, that:

 

Being hearsay
such a statement is technically inadmissible yet, in view of the opportunity of
opposing counsel to cross-examine the witness on the statement, the main reason
for the hearsay rule disappears and consequently the possibility of injustice
is negatived.

 

                   Furthermore, commentators
observe, the witness's recantation has accomplished all that the opponent's
cross-examination could hope to:  the witness now testifies under oath that the
prior statement was a lie, or claims to have no recollection of the matters in
the statement, thus undermining its credibility as much as cross-examination
could have.  As Stuesser pointed out (at p. 60), in fact ""the mantle of a
`hostile' cross-examiner in the case of a recanting witness is taken up by the
caller of the witness"".

 

                   Proponents of the orthodox
rule concentrate on the importance of contemporaneous cross-examination;
an oft-quoted statement is that of Stone J. in the Minnesota Supreme Court in State
v. Saporen, 285 N.W. 898 (1939), at p. 901:

 

                   The
chief merit of cross examination is not that at some future time it gives the
party opponent the right to dissect adverse testimony.  Its principal virtue is
in its immediate application of the testing process.  Its strokes fall while
the iron is hot.  False testimony is apt to harden and become unyielding to the
blows of truth in proportion as the witness has opportunity for reconsideration
and influence by the suggestions of others, whose interest may be, and often
is, to maintain falsehood rather than truth.

 

Equally oft-quoted, however, is E. M. Morgan's
reply, in ""Hearsay Dangers and the Application of the Hearsay
Concept"" (1948), 62 Harv. L. Rev. 177, at p. 193:

 

Why does
falsehood harden any more quickly or unyieldingly than truth?  What has become
of the idea that truth is eternal and, though crushed to earth, will rise again? 
Isn't the opportunity for reconsideration and for baneful influence by others
even more likely to color the later testimony than the prior statement?

 

Critics assert that there is a greater
opportunity for coercion, intimidation and fabrication in the time between the
taking of the statement and the trial than when the statement was made closer
to the time of the events described.  Proponents of the orthodox rule point to
the time between the events described and when the statement was made as
presenting opportunities for identical coercion and intimidation, and assert
that later coercion may be directed towards convincing the witness to tell the
truth at trial.  It is clear that statements are neither more nor less likely
to be true based solely on a consideration of when they were made.

 

                   Furthermore, to argue about
which statement is more likely to be true based on the opportunity for improper
influence misconceives the nature of the problem before the court.  The
question is not whether it would be better to have had contemporaneous
cross-examination at the time the statement was made; of course it would have,
and this is a factor which must affect any consideration of the weight to be
afforded the evidence by the trier of fact.  Instead, the real issue to be
considered is whether the absence of contemporaneous cross-examination is a sufficient
reason to exclude the statement from the jury as substantive evidence.  In California
v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970), at pp. 160-61, White J. of the United States
Supreme Court wrote:

 

                   It
may be true that a jury would be in a better position to evaluate the truth of
the prior statement if it could somehow be whisked magically back in time to
witness a gruelling cross-examination of the declarant as he first gives his
statement.  But the question as we see it must be not whether one can somehow
imagine the jury in ""a better position"", but whether subsequent
cross-examination at the defendant's trial will still afford the trier of fact
a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.

 

Perhaps because it has been the most emphasized
of the hearsay dangers, it is clear that the lack of contemporaneous
cross-examination has also been the most criticized reason for excluding prior
inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.

 

                   (2)  Judicial and
Legislative Reform of the Rule

 

                   The orthodox rule has
attracted the attention of law reformers on the bench, in the legislatures, and
at law reform commissions.  All bodies which have turned their minds to the
orthodox rule have recommended a departure from the strict prohibition on substantive
admissibility in favour of qualified admissibility.

 

                   The Law Reform Commission of
Canada, in its 1975 Report on Evidence, proposed that the hearsay rule
should not exclude prior inconsistent statements by a witness, on the grounds
that the witness could be cross-examined on the prior statement, that
circumstances may serve to make the prior statement more reliable (since his
memory may have been fresher and it may have been made before anyone had the
opportunity to improperly influence the witness), the witness will have the
opportunity of denying the prior statement or explaining the inconsistencies,
and that the distinction between permissible and impermissible use of the
evidence was a difficult one.  Thus, Draft Section 28 proposed by the Commission
provided:  ""A statement previously made by a witness is not excluded by
section 27 [which makes hearsay evidence inadmissible] if the statement would
be admissible if made by him while testifying as a witness.""

 

                   The Ontario Law Reform
Commission, in its Report on the Law of Evidence (1976), took a
different approach, maintaining the orthodox rule where a prior inconsistent
statement was made by the calling party's witness, but allowing evidence of the
prior inconsistent statements of the opposing party's witness to be admitted
for their truth once proof is given that the witness in fact made the
statement.

 

                   The Federal/Provincial Task
Force recommended that prior inconsistent statements be substantively
admissible if they were made under oath and subject to cross-examination at the
time they were made.

 

                   Most jurisdictions in the
United States have abandoned the orthodox rule through both judicial and
legislative action.  Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides:

 

Rule 801.  ...

 

                   (d)
Statements which are not hearsay. -- A statement is not hearsay if --

 

 

                   (1)
Prior statement by witness. --  The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing
and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement
is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was given under oath
subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or
in a deposition....

 

                   This expanded rule of
admissibility is now in force in 21 states.  Four states and the District of
Columbia adhere to the orthodox rule, 8 states follow modified rules different
from the Federal Rule, and 17 states allow prior inconsistent statements to be
admitted for their truth with no restrictions.  Some states require additional
indicia of reliability, including:  personal knowledge of the facts contained
in the statement, a demonstration of the reliability of the evidence, a
requirement that the statement have been made voluntarily and not as the result
of coercion or merely in response to allegations by the investigator, or
contemporaneous recording, transcription or videotaping of the statement.  It
can readily be seen that one of these additional requirements (personal
knowledge) would be required in any event for non-hearsay evidence from a
witness to be admissible, mirroring the requirement in the Law Reform
Commission of Canada's Report that to be substantively admissible, the prior
statement must be one which would have been admissible if made by the declarant
while testifying as a witness.

 

                   In England and Scotland, the
orthodox rule applies to criminal proceedings, although, as in Canada and the
United States, there has been widespread criticism of the rule in that
context.  The English Civil Evidence Act 1968 (U.K.), 1968, c. 64, renders
the prior inconsistent statement of a witness admissible for its truth in civil
proceedings:

 

3. -- (1)Where in any civil proceedings --

 

(a)a
previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a
witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of section 3, 4 or 5 of the
Criminal Procedure Act 1865 

 

                                                                    ...

 

that statement
shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated
therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.

 

                   Thus, it can be seen that the
majority of law reformers, legislators and the judiciary have heeded the almost
unanimous call to reform the orthodox rule.  In all reformed rules, the hearsay
dangers are addressed in one combination or another, supporting the
characterization of the orthodox rule as an incarnation of the hearsay rule,
and presenting this Court with a variety of alternatives from which to choose. 
The variety of approaches chosen after careful consideration of the issue by
these various bodies also indicates that we must carefully balance the
interests of the accused in a criminal trial with the interests of society in
seeing justice done when deciding what guarantees of reliability will suffice
to render prior inconsistent statements admissible for the truth of their
contents.  Any reformed rule must address the hearsay dangers, yet not be so
restrictive towards that end so as to be of limited utility in the majority of cases.

 

                   (3)  Developments in the
Law of Hearsay

 

                   Finally, it is clear that the
orthodox rule, in so far as it is based on the hearsay rule, has been
undermined by the decisions of this Court in Khan and Smith.  In Smith,
I stated that the decision in Khan ""should be understood as the
triumph of a principled analysis over a set of ossified judicially created
categories"" (p. 930), and that that decision (at p. 933)

 

signalled an
end to the old categorical approach to the admission of hearsay evidence.  Hearsay
evidence is now admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles
being the reliability of the evidence, and its necessity.

 

I will return to Smith and the principled
approach to the hearsay rule as it applies in the particular case of prior
inconsistent statements, but it is important to note that any erosion of the
categorical approach to the hearsay rule must influence the Court's
consideration of the orthodox rule as one instance of that rule.

 

D.  Stare Decisis

 

                   Before considering a new rule
pertaining to the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements for the truth
of their contents, it is necessary to address the arguments of the respondent,
strenuously advanced before this Court, that (i) this Court should not overrule
Deacon, and (ii) that any change to the orthodox rule is for Parliament
to make and not this Court.  The arguments are related, and to some extent
undermine one another, since the first identifies the source of the orthodox
rule as it applies in Canada in the common law of evidence as developed by this
Court, even while the second denies that the common law is the appropriate
vehicle to change the orthodox rule.  I will deal with the second argument
first, since the issue of overruling Deacon does not arise if this Court
decides to wait for Parliament to reform the orthodox rule.

 

                   The rules of evidence are
primarily judge-made, and the Law Reform Commission of Canada called the
hearsay rule ""the most characteristic ... rule of our system of
evidence"" (p. 69).  In Smith, I affirmed the statement of Lord
Donovan, dissenting in Myers v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1965]
A.C. 1001 (H.L.), at p. 1047, that ""[t]he common law is moulded by the
judges and it is still their province to adapt it from time to time so as to make
it serve the interests of those it binds"" (p. 931).  Significantly, Myers
was a decision in which a majority of the House of Lords refused to create a
new hearsay exception relating to business records, leading to a legislative
response overcoming the decision.

 

                   This duty of the courts to
review common law rules has a pragmatic basis:  courts are best situated to
assess the operation and possible deficiencies of common law rules in practical
situations.  Finally, if any other authority for the jurisdiction and, in some
cases, the responsibility of the courts to reform the common law were
needed, the late Chief Justice Laskin wrote, in ""The Role and Functions of
Final Appellate Courts:  The Supreme Court of Canada"" (1975), 53 Can.
Bar Rev. 469, at pp. 478-79:

 

                   When
everything considered relevant has been weighed and an overruling decision
commends itself to a judge, he ought not at that stage to stay his opinion and
call upon the legislature to implement it.  This is particularly true in
respect of those areas of the law which are judge-made, and to a degree true in
respect of those areas where legislation is involved which is susceptible of a
number of meanings.  A final court must accept a superintending responsibility
for what it or its predecessors have wrought, especially when it knows how
little time legislatures today have (and also, perhaps, little inclination) to
intrude into fields of law fashioned by the courts alone, although legislatures
may, of course, under the prodding of law reform agencies and of other public
influences, from time to time do so.

 

                   While this Court has limited
changes to the common law to those which are ""slow and incremental""
rather than ""major and far-reaching"" (McLachlin J. in Watkins v.
Olafson, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750, at p. 760), and only ""those incremental
changes which are necessary to keep the common law in step with the dynamic and
evolving fabric of our society"" (Iacobucci J. in R. v. Salituro,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 670), it is important to assess the change in the
correct frame of reference.

 

                   In the context of any
particular impugned rule standing on its own, no change could ever satisfy the
above criteria.  Viewed this way, changing the orthodox rule will mean
eliminating the orthodox rule because of its absolute prohibition on the
substantive use of prior inconsistent statements.  The respondent correctly
submits that this change is not slow and incremental.

 

                   However, if the change to the
orthodox rule is viewed within the larger context of the trend within evidence
law towards greater admissibility and a correspondingly increased emphasis on
the weight to be accorded admissible evidence, the change is clearly
incremental as it renders one particular type of evidence admissible for a
certain purpose subject to certain conditions.  Even if the frame of reference
is narrowed to the adoption, by this Court, of a principled approach to hearsay
evidence in Khan, and Smith, the change to a reformed rule is but
an application of that principled approach to a particular type of otherwise
excluded hearsay evidence, which is appropriate and ""necessary to keep the
common law in step with the dynamic and evolving fabric of our society""
for all the same reasons that the adoption of the principled approach was necessary
in Khan and Smith.  As I wrote in Smith (at p. 932):

 

What is
important, in my view, is the departure signalled by Khan from a view of
hearsay characterized by a general prohibition on the reception of such
evidence, subject to a limited number of defined categorical exceptions, and a
movement towards an approach governed by the principles which underlie the rule
and its exceptions alike.  The movement towards a flexible approach was
motivated by the realization that, as a general rule, reliable evidence ought
not to be excluded simply because it cannot be tested by cross-examination.

 

                   Notably, in Salituro,
at p. 666, Iacobucci J. cited the decision of McLachlin J. in Khan as an
example of this Court's ""willingness to adapt and develop common law rules
to reflect changing circumstances in society at large"".

 

                   Therefore, I do not believe
that considering a change to a reformed prior inconsistent statements rule is a
matter better left to Parliament; the rule itself is judge-made and lends
itself to judicial reform, and it is a natural and incremental progression in
the development of the law of hearsay in Canada by this Court.

 

                   Having decided that it is the
province and duty of this Court to review the orthodox rule, the question then
becomes whether this Court's decision in Deacon stands in the way of
implementing the rule we think best.  I do not think that it does.

 

                   In Salituro, at p. 665,
Iacobucci J. stated that ""[t]his Court is now willing, where there are
compelling reasons for doing so, to overturn its own previous decisions."" 
However, there are guidelines which direct our exercise of this jurisdiction to
overrule previous decisions.  In R. v. Chaulk, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, at
p. 1353, I adopted the considerations listed by Dickson C.J. (in dissent) in R.
v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833.  Those guidelines were:

 

                   (1)whether
the rule or principle under consideration must be varied in order to avoid a Charter 
breach;

 

                   (2)whether
the rule or principle under consideration has been attenuated or undermined by
other decisions of this or other appellate courts;

 

                   (3)whether
the rule or principle under consideration has created uncertainty or has become
""unduly and unnecessarily complex and technical;"" and

 

                   (4)whether
the proposed change in the rule or principle is one which broadens the scope of
criminal liability, or is otherwise unfavourable to the position of the
accused.

 

                   While it is not necessary to
vary the rule to avoid a Charter  breach, the respondent submitted that
any change would in fact result in a Charter  violation, since a change
to the orthodox rule would be inconsistent with any right the accused may have
under the Charter  to ""confrontation,"" analogous to the U.S.
constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment (which provides that ""[i]n
all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . be
confronted with the witnesses against him . . . "").  The respondent relied
heavily on R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, in which Wilson J. held
that the introduction of preliminary inquiry evidence at trial pursuant to s.
715  of the Criminal Code  (formerly s. 643 ) did not violate the accused's
rights under ss. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter , as long as the
accused had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine the witness (at p. 543):

 

It is, in my
view, basic to our system of justice that the accused have had a full
opportunity to cross-examine the witness when the previous testimony was taken
if a transcript of such testimony is to be introduced as evidence in a criminal
trial for the purpose of convicting the accused.

 

With respect to s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
Wilson J. held (at p. 546):  ""...this claim must also fail if his
constitutional right to have had a full opportunity to cross-examine the
witness on the earlier occasion was respected"".

 

                   However, it is clear that
Wilson J.'s emphasis on the importance of cross-examination at the time the
evidence was given was necessitated by the present unavailability of the
witness, as required by the list of circumstances in s. 715(1)(a) to (d): 
for the purposes of that provision, the witness must be proven to have refused
to testify, or be dead, insane, too ill to travel, or absent from Canada. 
Cross-examination at the time the evidence was given is clearly the only
kind of cross-examination possible where a witness is unavailable at trial, so
Wilson J.'s words should not be read in an overly restrictive fashion.  In the
case of prior inconsistent statements, by definition the witness is presently
available for cross-examination, and cross-examination at trial represents an
adequate safeguard of the accused's ss. 7  and 11 (d) rights as a
substitute for cross-examination at the time the prior inconsistent statement
was made.  I have discussed the arguments respecting the value of
contemporaneous cross-examination, and will return to them below.  In addition,
Wilson J. also expressed the more lenient proposition in Potvin (at p.
544) that ""It is, as I have said, a principle of fundamental justice that
the accused have had a full opportunity to cross-examine the adverse
witness"", indicating that her references to contemporaneity were perhaps
not intended to define the content of the right to cross-examine.  This more
lenient requirement is clearly satisfied in the case of prior inconsistent
statements.

 

                   I note also that the effect of
this Court's holding in Khan, in which the evidence of a child
complainant was admitted through her mother's testimony, was to deprive the
accused of any opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarant, either at
the time the statement was made or at trial.  Similarly, in Smith, the
hearsay declarant was dead, Smith being tried for her murder.  Indeed, such is
the case with all of the hearsay exceptions in which necessity is created by
the unavailability of the hearsay declarant, either under the old categorical
approach or under the new principled approach.  In neither Khan nor Smith
was it suggested that the inability of the accused to cross-examine the hearsay
declarant at any time infringed any of the accused's Charter 
rights.  In this case, the accused has the added protection of full
cross-examination at trial.

 

                   Finally, the operation of a
modified rule to admit the accused's self-incriminating prior inconsistent
statements from a previous proceeding in violation of s. 13  is foreclosed by
this Court's decision in Kuldip, which recognized that this provision of
the Charter  required a form of the orthodox rule to be applied to the
accused's prior statements, even though such statements, being admissions,
would not be excluded as substantive evidence by the hearsay rule.

 

                   The other guidelines also
suggest that this Court should not decline to overrule Deacon if it
thinks best to do so.  While the orthodox rule itself has not been attenuated
by this Court, the traditional hearsay rules from which it developed and which
supply its rationale certainly have been in Khan and Smith. 
Successful attacks on the categorical approach to the hearsay rule also weaken
the underpinnings of the orthodox rule.  It is true that this Court has
recently restated the orthodox rule, but it has not done so in the context of
reconsidering the orthodox rule itself.

 

                   Part of the rationale for the
orthodox rule has similarly been attenuated by changes in the methods of proof
and demonstration in the modern trial process.  When hearsay evidence is
tendered, the trier of fact is being asked to act on second-hand testimony: 
the trier never actually hears or sees the hearsay declarant make the
statement, and so has no basis on which to evaluate the statement for him or
herself.  Rather, the trier of fact must rely on the account of the statement
given by the testifying witness, with all of the inherent weaknesses of
recollection and perception that human witnesses possess.  All of this has
changed with the advent of videotaping.  In a manner not possible when Wright
v. Beckett, Duckworth, or Deacon were decided, prior
statements can be placed before the trier of fact in their entirety and in a
form which ensures their integrity.  This change has significantly undermined
the ""presence"" rationale for the orthodox rule.

 

                   Respecting the complexity or
technicality of the orthodox rule's distinction between permissible and
impermissible uses of prior inconsistent statements, I wrote in Kuldip,
at p. 635, that ""While such a distinction may be somewhat troublesome to
the jury, it is my view that with the benefit of clear instructions from the
trial judge the jury will not be unduly burdened with this distinction."" 
The distinction of the orthodox rule itself is not overly complex, but once
viewed as part of the categorical approach to hearsay evidence, it is clear
that it is one of the more artificial and technical of the rules of evidence
from the point of view of a juror.  It would be far better, in my view, to
replace the blanket exclusion of reliable evidence for a particular purpose
with a general rule of admissibility for all purposes when certain criteria are
met.

 

                   Finally, there is the matter
of whether reforming the orthodox rule would be more favourable to the Crown
than to the accused, or would otherwise broaden the scope of criminal
liability.  In R. v. Williams (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 321, leave to appeal
to S.C.C. refused, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xiv, Martin J.A. for the Ontario Court of
Appeal stated, at p. 341, that ""[g]enerally speaking, the accused, rather
than the Crown, is the beneficiary of the rule that prior inconsistent
statements of a witness (unless adopted by him in his evidence) are not
evidence of the facts contained in them.""  This is because the Crown bears
the burden of leading evidence, much of which will be based on police
interviews with potential witnesses, leading to a greater likelihood that a
Crown witness will recant and allow the Crown to take advantage of a reformed
rule.  The accused and his counsel will not often have the same access to
witnesses to collect prior statements, and may not in fact lead evidence at
all.

 

                   However, I do not think that
it can be conclusively stated that a reformed rule would necessarily broaden
the scope of criminal liability in the sense intended by Dickson C.J. in Bernard. 
In Bernard, at pp. 860-61, Dickson C.J. wrote of the fourth guideline:

 

Respect for the
principle of certainty and the institutional limits imposed upon the law-making
function of the courts should constrain the Court from overruling a prior
decision where the effect would be to expand criminal liability.  It is not for
the courts to create new offences, or to broaden the net of liability,
particularly as changes in the law through judicial decision operate
retrospectively.  The same argument does not apply, however, where the result
of overruling a prior decision is to establish a rule favourable to the
accused.

 

Thus, it can be seen that Dickson C.J. was
speaking of a more causally direct expansion of criminal liability; for
example, in Bernard by reconsidering the effect of drunkenness on
criminal liability, and in Chaulk by reconsidering the meaning of
insanity.  Merely admitting substantive evidence which will more often perhaps,
incriminate the accused than it will exculpate the accused does not, in my
view, expand criminal liability in the sense intended by Dickson C.J. in Bernard. 
To enable the Crown to secure more convictions with a new evidentiary rule
expanding the scope of admissibility is not to expand the scope of criminal
liability; it is, rather, to find more criminals liable.  It cannot be said
that the accused has any ""certainty"" interest in the orthodox rule,
unless one considers the situation where the accused convinces a Crown witness
to recant, secure in the knowledge that the prior statement will not be
substantively admissible.  This is not a result that the value of certainty is
intended to promote.  In addition, the courts are not institutionally limited
from adjusting common law rules, as I have stated above, the same way they are
from making wholesale changes to the elements of substantive offences.  While
it may be true that prior inconsistent statements will more often be tendered
by the Crown, this is not to say that such statements will always be believed
by the trier of fact in preference to the witnesses' present testimony.

 

                   Therefore, the guidelines
established in Bernard do not suggest that this Court should do anything
other than what it thinks best in reconsidering the orthodox rule:  a reformed
rule would not violate the Charter , the existing rule has been
attenuated by developments in the law of hearsay and is somewhat, if not overly,
technical, and reforming the rule would not directly expand the scope of
criminal liability.  All that remains is to consider what this Court ought to
do.

 

V - The New Admissibility Rule

 

A.  Requirements and the Hearsay Dangers

 

                   I am of the view that evidence
of prior inconsistent statements of a witness other than an accused should be
substantively admissible on a principled basis, following this Court's
decisions in Khan and Smith.  However, it is clear that the
factors identified in those cases -- reliability and necessity -- must be
adapted and refined in this particular context, given the particular problems
raised by the nature of such statements.  Furthermore, there must be a voir
dire before such statements are put before the jury as substantive
evidence, in which the trial judge satisfies him or herself that the statement
was made in circumstances which do not negate its reliability.

 

                   As a threshold matter, before
discussing the specific requirements of the reformed rule, I would adopt the requirement
embodied in the provision proposed by the Law Reform Commission of Canada, and
in the English Civil Evidence Act 1968, that prior inconsistent
statements will only be admissible if they would have been admissible as the
witness's sole testimony.  That is, if the witness could not have made the
statement at trial during his or her examination-in-chief or cross-examination,
for whatever reason, it cannot be made admissible through the back door, as it
were, under the reformed prior inconsistent statement rule.

 

                   There are two situations which
provide examples of this requirement.  First, it may be that the content of the
prior inconsistent statement would not normally be admissible because it is
hearsay.  If the witness makes a prior statement relating direct evidence about
a material fact (""I saw Y fire the gun""), there will be no barrier to
admitting the prior statement.  Such direct evidence would have been subject to
no exclusionary rule of evidence.

 

                   However, if the witness's
prior statement merely repeated the direct evidence of another person (""X
said he saw Y fire the gun""), such a statement, even when made with
circumstantial guarantees of reliability, will not be substantively admissible
for the truth of the evidence of that other person:  because the statement is
naked hearsay if offered to prove the fact that Y fired the gun, it would not
have been admissible to prove that fact (absent a hearsay exception) as direct
evidence from the testifying witness, and it does not become admissible evidence
to prove that fact through the operation of the reformed rule.  The only use
that can be made of such prior statements is as proof that the statement was
made to the witness, but not, obviously, as proof that Y fired the gun.  This
is no more than the hearsay rule applied to the prior statement as if it was
evidence tendered at trial.

 

                   The final possibility in this
category is the present case (""Y told me he fired the gun""), in which
the statement relates hearsay which is admissible under an established hearsay
exception:  while the statement repeats the evidence of another person, as in
the second example, the hearsay exception applicable to the reported statement
because it is an admission applies to the prior statement, again, as if the
prior statement itself had been the witness's sole testimony.  Because of the
circumstantial guarantees of reliability attaching to admissions (on the
assumption that an accused would not falsely incriminate himself), the hearsay
statement may be admitted to prove the fact that Y fired the gun.  But it is
crucial that the matters in the prior statement would have been admissible if
offered as the witness's sole testimony.

 

                   A second category of
inadmissible evidence must also be discussed.  In some cases, the prior statement
may be that of a state agent who repeats an admission by the accused.  Imagine
the case of a police agent (perhaps a friend of the accused who is conscripted
by the police) who is placed in the cell with the accused, and to whom the
accused makes an admission.  The police agent repeats the admission for the
police, but recants at trial.  Again, for the prior statement to be
substantively admissible under the reformed rule, the admission must have been
obtained in such a way that it would have been admissible as the witness's sole
evidence.  This Court has recently discussed the law applicable to such
statements in R. v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595.  For the Court,
Iacobucci J. held that the right to silence under s. 7  of the Charter 
was engaged only when the accused was detained, and that the right to silence
would be violated when a person acting as an agent of the state, but who is not
obviously a state agent in the eyes of the accused, elicits a statement from
the accused.  Evidence so obtained in violation of the accused's right to
silence would then be subject to exclusion under s. 24(2)  of the Charter ,
and with respect to the first of the factors enumerated in R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, Iacobucci J. held (at p. 618) that ""the fact that evidence
is obtained by conscripting the accused against himself or herself will
generally be sufficient to render the trial unfair"".  The other factors
(seriousness of the violation, and the effect of excluding the evidence) would
also have to be considered, but the first factor may well be determinative.

 

                   The distinctions established
in Broyles apply equally here.  If the accused was not in detention when
he or she made the admission, the prior statement of the state agent reporting
the admission will be admissible under the reformed rule, whether it was
elicited or not.  If the accused was in detention when he or she made the
admission, the prior statement of the state agent reporting the admission will
be admissible only if the admission was made without elicitation by the state
agent.  In circumstances where detention and elicitation are combined in
circumstances where the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) , the state
agent would not have been able to repeat the admission in his testimony at trial,
so substantive evidence of that admission cannot be put before the jury through
the operation of the reformed rule.

 

                   These are but two examples of
circumstances in which the admissibility of the prior statement must be
examined, lest what would be excluded as the witness's primary evidence be
admitted under the reformed rule simply because the witness has recanted.

 

                   I turn now to a consideration
of the circumstantial guarantees of reliability required in the reformed rule.

 

                   (1)  Reliability

 

                   The reliability of prior
inconsistent statements is clearly a key concern for law reformers and courts
which have reformed the orthodox rule, and, as I have outlined, this concern is
centred on the hearsay dangers:  the absence of an oath, presence, and contemporaneous
cross-examination.  The reliability concern is sharpened in the case of prior
inconsistent statements because the trier of fact is asked to choose between
two statements from the same witness, as opposed to other forms of hearsay in
which only one account from the declarant is tendered.  In other words, the
focus of the inquiry in the case of prior inconsistent statements is on the
comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered at
trial, and so additional indicia and guarantees of reliability to those
outlined in Khan and Smith must be secured in order to bring the
prior statement to a comparable standard of reliability before such statements
are admitted as substantive evidence.

 

                   In my opinion, and as my
discussion of these dangers above indicates, only the first two of these
dangers present real concerns in this context, and if these two dangers are
addressed, a sufficient degree of reliability has been established to allow the
trier of fact to weigh the statement against evidence tendered at trial by the
same witness.  The ultimate reliability of the statement and the weight to be
attached to it remain, as with all evidence, determinations for the trier of
fact.  What the reliability component of the principled approach to hearsay
exceptions addresses is a threshold of reliability, rather than ultimate or
certain reliability.

 

                   The history of the common law
exceptions to the hearsay rule suggests that for a hearsay statement to be
received, there must be some other fact or circumstance which compensates for,
or stands in the stead of the oath, presence and cross-examination.  Where the
safeguards associated with non-hearsay evidence are absent, there must be some
substitute factor to demonstrate sufficient reliability to make it safe to
admit the evidence.

 

                   I turn now to a consideration
of what ""substitute"" indicia of trustworthiness might suffice to
permit reception of prior inconsistent statements, bearing in mind that the
question of reliability is a matter for the trial judge, to be decided on the
particular circumstances of the case.

 

                   (i)  The Oath  

 

                   It is undeniable that the
significance of the oath has drastically changed since its introduction. 
Originally the oath was grounded upon a belief that divine retribution would
visit those who lied under oath.  Accordingly, witnesses were required to
believe in this retribution if they were to be properly sworn and their
evidence admissible.  In Omychund v. Barker (1744), 1 Atk. 21, 26 E.R.
15, Willes L.C.J. stated, at p. 31 E.R.:

 

                   Though
I have shewn that an Infidel in general cannot be excluded from being a
witness, and though I am of the opinion that infidels who believe a God, and
future rewards and punishments in the other world, may be witnesses; yet I am
as clearly of opinion, that if they do not believe a God, or future rewards and
punishments, they ought not to be admitted as witnesses.

 

Similarly, Lord Hardwicke L.C. referred (at p. 32
E.R.) to the oath as ""an appeal to the Supreme Being, as thinking him the
rewarder of truth, and avenger of falsehood"".  The difference between
sworn and unsworn evidence was therefore crucial, and the absence of an oath
when the prior statement was made was an important obstacle to admitting prior
inconsistent statements for their truth.

 

                   We no longer require this
belief in divine retribution; in Reference re Truscott, [1967] S.C.R.
309, at p. 368, this Court stated in the context of child witnesses that the
witness need only understand ""the moral obligation of telling the truth"". 
In this sense the oath can be said to have a changed significance, and if
critics of the oath suggest only that its original supernatural force has
disappeared, I agree with that observation.

 

                   It is also true, as Cory J.
notes, that sanctions attach to statements not made under oath.  A witness who
tells one story to the police and another at trial is currently exposed to
prosecution under ss. 139 (obstructing justice) and 140 (public mischief) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  Furthermore, with the Court's
decision in this case, prior statements which satisfy the criteria of
admissibility will be used as substantive evidence in a subsequent trial; as a
result, a witness who makes a false statement will also be liable to prosecution
under s. 137  (fabricating evidence), once he or she is informed that the
statement can, and indeed will, be used at trial if he or she recants. 
Finally, it may well be that, in light of this decision, Parliament will wish
to extend other criminal sanctions (such as the offence of perjury, for
example) to one who lies under oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration
in the course of a criminal investigation.

 

                   However, there remain
compelling reasons to prefer statements made under oath, solemn affirmation or
solemn declaration.  While the oath will not motivate all witnesses to tell the
truth (as is indicated by the witnesses' perjury in this case), its
administration may serve to impress on more honest witnesses the seriousness
and significance of their statements, especially where they incriminate another
person in a criminal investigation.

 

                   In addition to this positive
effect on the declarant, the presence of an oath, solemn affirmation or solemn
declaration will increase the evidentiary value of the statement when it is
admitted at trial.  First, it will mean that the trier of fact will not be
asked to accept unsworn testimony over sworn testimony; instead, the trier will
have the opportunity to choose between two sworn statements, and the trier's
ultimate decision will not be made on the basis of unsworn or unaffirmed
testimony.  Similarly, should the prior statement be decisive, there is no
danger of the accused being convicted solely on the basis of unsworn testimony.

 

                   Second, the presence of the
oath during the making of the prior statement eliminates the explanation
offered by many recanting witnesses, including one of the witnesses in this
case:  when confronted with the prior inconsistent statement, witnesses explain
that it was not made under oath, and assert that the oath they took at trial
persuaded them to tell the truth.  This naturally privileges the trial
testimony in the mind of the trier of fact.  If both statements were made under
oath, such an explanation can no longer be employed.  Furthermore, since both
statements cannot be true, the trier of fact has an indication of the low
regard in which the witness holds the oath.  Therefore, while it is true that
the oath in itself has no power to ensure truthfulness in some witnesses, the
fact that both statements were made under oath removes resort to the absence of
an oath as an indicium of the alleged unreliability of the prior inconsistent
statement.

 

                   The presence of an oath,
solemn affirmation or solemn declaration will have yet another positive effect
on the declarant's truthfulness and the administration of justice.  A sworn
prior statement will be highly persuasive evidence in any prosecution against
the declarant related to false testimony (whether in the statement or at
trial), and the knowledge that this evidence exists for this purpose should
weigh heavily on the mind of one who considers lying in a statement, or
recanting his or her prior statement to lie at trial.

 

                   Of course, the incentives
provided by the declarant's exposure to prosecution under ss. 137 , 139  and 140 
in relation to the first statement, and his or her fear of a perjury
prosecution in relation to testimony given at trial, will only be effective if
these sanctions are made known to the declarant.  For this reason, the witness
should be warned by the person taking the statement that the statement may be
used as evidence at a subsequent trial if the witness recants (thereby engaging
s. 137 ), and also that severe criminal sanctions will accompany the making of a
false statement.  This warning should refer specifically to ss. 137 , 139  and
140  of the Criminal Code , and repeat the elements of and sanctions for
those offences.  As does the formal swearing of the witness in the trial
process, this warning and the administration of the oath should serve to bring
home to the witness the gravity of the situation and his duty to tell the
truth.

 

                   Therefore, the best indicium
of reliability on the principled approach of Smith in the case of prior
inconsistent statements is that the statement, to be substantively admissible,
has been made (i) under oath, solemn affirmation, or solemn declaration, and
(ii) following the administration of an explicit warning to the witness of his
or her amenability to prosecution if it is discovered that he or she has lied. 
This indicium satisfies the first hearsay danger entirely:  in no case will the
trier of fact be asked to accept unsworn testimony over sworn testimony,
verdicts will not be based on unsworn testimony, and the circumstances which
promote truthful trial testimony will have been recreated as fully as is
possible.

 

                   Were the oath an absolute
requirement for a finding of reliability, the only prior inconsistent
statements which could be received would be  statements made in circumstances
where the person receiving the statement is authorized to administer the
warning and the oath or affirmation.  Thus, statements made to family members
or friends would generally not comply, unless the witness then repeats the
statement for appropriately authorized persons.  In the case of police
interviews, this would likely present no real difficulty, since each police
station will usually have a Justice of the Peace present or readily available
for interim release hearings.  The Justice could then administer the warning
before the statement is made, and the oath after the statement is made. 
Similarly, police officers on duty as the Officer in Charge could be made
commissioners for the taking of oaths in the province, and administer the
warning and oath in the Justice's absence.

 

                   However, I do not wish to
create technical categorical requirements duplicating those of the old approach
to hearsay evidence.  It follows from Smith that there may be situations
in which the trial judge concludes that an appropriate substitute for the oath
is established and that notwithstanding the absence of an oath the statement is
reliable.  Other circumstances may serve to impress upon the witness the
importance of telling the truth, and in so doing provide a high degree of
reliability to the statement.  While these occasions may not be frequent, I do
not foreclose the possibility that they might arise under the principled
approach to hearsay evidence.

 

                   (ii)  Presence

 

                   Proponents of the orthodox
rule emphasize the many verbal and non-verbal cues which triers of fact rely
upon in order to assess credibility.  When the witness is on the stand, the
trier can observe the witness's reaction to questions, hesitation, degree of
commitment to the statement being made, etc.  Most importantly, and subsuming
all of these factors, the trier can assess the relationship between the
interviewer and the witness to observe the extent to which the testimony of the
witness is the product of the investigator's questioning.  Such subtle
observations and cues cannot be gleaned from a transcript, read in court in
counsel's monotone, where the atmosphere of the exchange is entirely lost.

 

                   All of these indicia of
credibility, and therefore reliability, are available to the trier of fact when
the witness's prior statement is videotaped.  During the course of the hearing,
counsel for the appellant screened a brief excerpt from the videotape of one of
the interviews.  In the main portion of the television screen is a
medium-length shot of the witness facing the camera and seated across a table
from the interviewing officer, showing the physical relationship between the
two people.  In one upper corner is a close-up of the witness's face as he or
she speaks, capturing nuances of expression lost in the main view.  Along the
bottom of the screen is a line showing the date and a time counter, with the
seconds ticking off, ensuring that the continuity and integrity of the record
is maintained.  The audio-visual medium captures other elements of the
statement lost in a transcript, such as actions or distinctive motions which
the witness demonstrates (as in this case), or answers given by nodding or
shaking the head.  In other words, the experience of being in the room with the
witness and the interviewing officer is recreated as fully as possible for the
viewer.  Not only does the trier of fact have access to the full range of
non-verbal indicia of credibility, but there is also a reproduction of the statement
which is fully accurate, eliminating the danger of inaccurate recounting which
motivates the rule against hearsay evidence.  In a very real sense, the
evidence ceases to be hearsay in this important respect, since the hearsay
declarant is brought before the trier of fact.

 

                   Of course, the police would
not resort to this precaution in every case; it may well be reserved for cases
such as this, where a major crime such as murder is being investigated, the
testimony of the witnesses is important to the Crown's case, and the character
of the witnesses suggests that such precautions would be advisable.  It is
quite possible that such equipment would be available to police of given forces
at a central location, and that such crucial though unstable witnesses will be
taken to such locations to make their statements, or, where the statements have
already been made, to repeat them in a form which may be substantively
admissible should the witness recant.

 

                   In addition to an oath or
solemn affirmation and warning, then, a complete videotape record of the type
described above, or one which duplicates the experience of observing a witness
in the courtroom to the same extent, is another important indicium of
reliability which will satisfy the principled basis for the admission of
hearsay evidence.

 

                   Again, it may be possible that
the testimony of an independent third party who observes the making of the
statement in its entirety could, in exceptional circumstances, also provide the
requisite reliability with respect to demeanour evidence.  I would only note at
this point that there are many persons who could serve this function:  police
stations will have justices of the peace present or available, the witness may
have his or her own lawyer present, and ss. 56(2) (c) and 56(2) (d)
of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1 , provide that a young
person making a statement has a right of access to counsel, parents, or adult
relatives.  It will be a matter for the trial judge to determine whether or not
a sufficient substitute for a videotape record has been provided to allow the
trier of fact access to sufficient demeanour evidence to make the statement
admissible.

 

                   (iii)  Cross-examination

 

                   The final hearsay danger is
the lack of contemporaneous cross-examination when the statement is made.  The
appellant is correct to concede that this is the most important of the hearsay
dangers.  However, in the case of prior inconsistent statements, it is also the
most easily remedied by the opportunity to cross-examine at trial.  This is a
feature of prior inconsistent statements that conclusively distinguishes them
from other forms of hearsay.  As the United States Supreme Court noted in California
v. Green, supra, at p. 159:

 

... the
inability to cross-examine the witness at the time he made his prior statement
cannot easily be shown to be of crucial significance as long as the defendant
is assured of full and effective cross-examination at the time of trial.  The
most successful cross-examination at the time the prior statement was made
could hardly hope to accomplish more than has already been accomplished by the
fact that the witness is now telling a different, inconsistent story, and -- in
this case -- one that is favorable to the defendant.

 

                   Furthermore, unlike the oath
and presence, it is the hearsay danger which is impossible to address outside
of judicial or quasi-judicial processes.  Whereas the police can easily
administer a warning and oath, and videotape a statement in the course of a
witness interview, it would restrict the operation of a reformed rule to
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings to require contemporaneous
cross-examination, and thereby severely restrict the impact of a reformed rule. 
Consider the facts of the present case:  when the three witnesses were
interviewed by the police, no one had yet been charged with an offence.  Who
could have cross-examined the witnesses at that point?  How could
cross-examination have been effective before the case to be met was known? 
These and other practical difficulties in requiring contemporaneous
cross-examination tip the balance in favour of allowing cross-examination at
trial to serve as a substitute.  Again, we must remember that the question is
not whether it would have been preferable to have had the benefit of
contemporaneous cross-examination, but whether the absence of such
cross-examination is a sufficient reason to keep the statement from the jury as
substantive evidence.  Given the other guarantees of trustworthiness, I do not
think that it should be allowed to be a barrier to substantive admissibility. 
Of course, it will be an important consideration for the trier of fact in
deciding what weight to attach to the prior inconsistent statement, and it is
likely that opposing counsel will stress the absence of such cross-examination
to the trier of fact.

 

                   Therefore, the requirement of
reliability will be satisfied when the circumstances in which the prior
statement was made provide sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness with
respect to the two hearsay dangers a reformed rule can realistically address: 
if (i) the statement is made under oath or solemn affirmation following a
warning as to the existence of sanctions and the significance of the oath or
affirmation, (ii) the statement is videotaped in its entirety, and (iii) the
opposing party, whether the Crown or the defence, has a full opportunity to
cross-examine the witness respecting the statement, there will be sufficient circumstantial
guarantees of reliability to allow the jury to make substantive use of the
statement.  Alternatively, other circumstantial guarantees of reliability may
suffice to render such statements substantively admissible, provided that the
judge is satisfied that the circumstances provide adequate assurances of
reliability in place of those which the hearsay rule traditionally requires.

 

                   (2)  Necessity

 

                   Prior inconsistent statements
present vexing problems for the necessity criterion.  The necessity criterion
has usually been satisfied by the unavailable witness:  in Khan, the
child declarant who could not be sworn, and in Smith, the dead
declarant.  By definition, the declarant in the case of prior inconsistent
statements is available at trial; it is his or her prior statement that is
unavailable because of the recantation.

 

                   However, it is important to
remember that the necessity criterion ""must be given a flexible
definition, capable of encompassing diverse situations"" (Smith, at
pp. 933-34).  Wigmore, vol. 5 (Chadbourn rev. 1974), § 1421, at p. 253,
referred to two classes of necessity:

 

                   (1) 
The person whose assertion is offered may now be dead, or out of the
jurisdiction, or insane, or otherwise unavailable for the purpose of
testing.  This is the commoner and more palpable reason....

 

                   (2) 
The assertion may be such that we cannot expect, again, or at this time, to get
evidence of the same value from the same or other sources....  The
necessity is not so great; perhaps hardly a necessity, only an expediency or
convenience, can be predicated.  But the principle is the same. [Emphasis in
original.]

 

As an example of the second type of necessity,
many established hearsay exceptions do not rely on the unavailability of the
witness.  Some examples include admissions, present sense impressions and
business records.  This is because there are very high circumstantial
guarantees of reliability attached to such statements, offsetting that fact
that only expediency or convenience militate in favour of admitting the
evidence.

 

                   Indeed, in shaping the law of
hearsay in Canada, this Court has not treated necessity in the sense of
unavailability as the sine qua non of admissibility.  In Ares v.
Venner, [1970] S.C.R. 608, for example, nurses' records were admitted as
evidence at a medical negligence trial.  The nurses, though present in court
through the trial, were not called as witnesses.  The Alberta Court of Appeal
ordered a new trial, on the basis that Wigmore's necessity ground for the
admission of hearsay was not satisfied since the nurses were available to
testify.  This Court allowed an appeal from this decision, holding at p. 626
that:

 

                   Hospital
records, including nurses' notes, made contemporaneously by someone having a
personal knowledge of the matters then being recorded and under a duty to make
the entry or record should be received in evidence as prima facie proof
of the facts stated therein.

 

The Court made no reference to the present
availability of the nurses as it related to the admissibility of the hearsay
evidence, except to note their presence in court meant that the defendant could
have challenged the accuracy of the notes if he had so wished.  Similarly, the
maker of the prior inconsistent statement is present in court as a witness to
be examined and cross-examined as to the accuracy of the recording of the
statement.  Ares v. Venner stands as an example of a judicially-created
hearsay exception which did not require unavailability.  While the decisions in
Khan and Smith established that Canadian courts will no longer
carve out categorical ""exceptions"", the new approach shares the same
principled basis as the existing exceptions.

 

                   I note also that some lower
courts interpreting this Court's decision in Khan have also given the
necessity criterion a flexible definition.  In Khan v. College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Ontario (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 641, the Ontario Court of
Appeal returned to the incident which led to this Court's decision in R. v.
Khan.  The disciplinary hearing took place some four years after the
initial incident, at which time the child complainant was old enough to
testify.  However, the committee also heard evidence from the complainant's
mother and other persons to whom the complainant had described the assault. 
The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this was not an error, since the interval
between the time of the assault and the time of the disciplinary hearing meant
that the complainant's ability to recall and recount the assault had
deteriorated, compared to her statements immediately after the incident.  Thus,
the court held that the testimony of certain of the witnesses to whom the
complainant described the assault was admissible under the Khan test,
since it was ""reasonably necessary"" in the circumstances, and (at p.
655) ""[a] rule which would automatically exclude the out-of-court
statement where the child testifies is inconsistent with Ares v. Venner,
supra, the authority relied on in Khan.""

 

                   The precise limits of the
necessity criterion remain to be established in the context of specific cases. 
It may be that in some circumstances, the availability of the witness will mean
that hearsay evidence of that witness's prior consistent (the kind of
statement at issue in Khan) statements will not be admissible.  However,
I am not prepared, at this point, to adhere to a strict interpretation that
makes unavailability an indispensable condition of necessity.

 

                   In the case of prior inconsistent
statements, it is patent that we cannot expect to get evidence of the same
value from the recanting witness or other sources:  as counsel for the
appellant claimed, the recanting witness holds the prior statement, and thus
the relevant evidence, ""hostage.""  The different ""value"" of
the evidence is found in the fact that something has radically changed between
the time when the statement was made and the trial and, assuming that there is
a sufficient degree of reliability established under the first criterion, the
trier of fact should be allowed to weigh both statements in light of the
witness's explanation of the change.

 

B.  The Voir Dire

 

                   Pursuant to the circumstantial
guarantees of reliability described above, prior statements may be used as
substantive evidence of their contents by the jury.  The two-stage process by
which this may be done must now be described.  After the calling party invokes
s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act , and fulfils its requirements in the voir
dire held under that section, the party must then state its intention in
tendering the statement.  If the party indicates that it wishes to use the
statement only to impeach the credibility of the witness, that is the end of the
matter as regards the reformed rule:  the trial proceeds as it did under the
orthodox rule, with the judge instructing the jury accordingly.  If, however,
the party gives notice that it will seek to make substantive use of the
statement, the trial judge must continue the voir dire to satisfy him or
herself on the appropriate measure (which I will discuss below) that these
indicia of reliability, or acceptable substitutes, are present:  the oath,
affirmation, or solemn declaration will be proved, the person who administered
the oath, affirmation, or solemn declaration will testify that he or she also
administered the warning (or perhaps this could be incorporated into the oath,
affirmation, or solemn declaration), and the videotape will be tendered into evidence,
its authenticity sworn to, and, if the trial judge wishes, screened to ensure
its veracity and integrity.

 

                   With respect to the burden of
proof in the voir dire, ordinarily the trial judge should be satisfied
that these indicia of reliability are established on the balance of
probabilities, the normal burden resting upon a party seeking to admit
evidence.  This is no more than a corollary of the requirement that the prior
statements must relate evidence which would have been admissible as the witness's
sole testimony had he or she not recanted.

 

                   A different situation might
exist where the prior statement reports an admission made by the accused.  If
the statement is not made to a person in authority no special burden is
required, since the ordinary burden for the admission of evidence would have
applied to the witness's testimony at trial had he or she not recanted. 
However, if the prior statement reports an admission of the accused made to a
person in authority, the higher burden associated with the law relating to
confessions may well apply.  Such incidents will be rare, since persons in
authority who receive statements in the course of their duties from accused
persons will not often recant.  Additionally, if an agent of the state elicits
a statement from a detained accused, the case law developed under the Charter 
in this respect would have to be considered with respect to the burden during
the voir dire.

 

                   As neither of these issues
arise in this case (since the recanting witnesses were clearly neither persons
in authority in relation to the accused, nor were they agents of the state when
the accused made his admissions to them, nor was the accused detained), I would
leave those rare and theoretical situations to be addressed when and if they
arise.

 

                   However, I would incorporate
another aspect of the rule relating to confessions in the voir dire. 
Even where there has been a warning and oath administered, and the statement
videotaped, or sufficient substitutes established, the trial judge will still
have the discretion to refuse to allow the jury to make substantive use of the
statement.  Prior statements share many characteristics with confessions,
especially where police investigators are involved.  Proponents of the orthodox
rule voice the concern that malign influences on the witness by police may
precede the making of the statement and shape its content, in the same way that
confessions may be suspect if coerced by police investigators.  That is, it
still may be the case that the oath and videotape, and the acknowledgement of
the warning, were made under circumstances that make them suspect.  For this
reason, the test developed by this Court for the admission of confessions is
well-suited to making a threshold determination of whether the circumstances
under which the statement was made undermine the veracity of the indicia of
reliability.

 

                   The classic statement of the
first part of the confession rule appears in Ibrahim v. The King, [1914]
A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609:

 

                   It
has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no
statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is
shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that
it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of
advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority.

 

Ibrahim was first adopted by this Court in Prosko v. The King (1922),
63 S.C.R. 226, and was extended in decisions such as Horvath v. The Queen,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 376, in which Beetz J. wrote (at pp. 424-25):

 

Furthermore,
the principle which inspires the rule remains a positive one; it is the
principle of voluntariness.  The principle always governs and may justify an
extension of the rule to situations where involuntariness has been caused
otherwise than by promises, threats, hope or fear, if it is felt that other
causes are as coercive as promises or threats, hope or fear and serious enough
to bring the principle into play.

 

                   I would apply this test to
prior statements.  The trial judge must satisfy him or herself (again, in the
majority of cases on the balance of probabilities) on the voir dire that
the statement was not the product of coercion of any form, whether it involves
threats, promises, excessively leading questions by the investigator or other
person in a position of authority, or other forms of investigatory misconduct.

 

                   I would add another element to
the trial judge's inquiry to address situations where the first factor might be
satisfied, but there are other aspects of police conduct which militate against
rewarding that conduct by admitting the evidence.  In Rothman v. The Queen,
[1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 696, I wrote that even if the Ibrahim test
was satisfied to make a confession admissible, such a confession ""shall
nevertheless be excluded if its use in the proceedings would, as a result of
what was said or done by any person in authority in eliciting the statement,
bring the administration of justice into disrepute.""

 

                   It must be stressed that the
trial judge is not making a determination on the voir dire as to the
ultimate reliability and credibility of the statement.  As I have indicated,
that is a matter for the trier of fact.  The trial judge need not be satisfied
that the prior statement was true and should be believed in preference to the
witness's current testimony.  This distinction is also derived from the law
relating to confessions.  In Piché v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23, at
pp. 25-26,  Cartwright C.J. noted that:

 

                   The
main reason assigned for the rule that an involuntary confession is to be
excluded is the danger that it may be untrue but, as has been recently
reasserted by this Court in DeClerq v. The Queen [[1968] S.C.R. 902],
the answer to the question whether such a confession should be admitted depends
on whether or not it was voluntary not on whether or not it was true.

 

Similarly, in Rothman, I wrote, at p. 691,
that

 

a statement
before being left to the trier of fact for consideration of its probative value
should be the object of a voir dire in order to determine, not whether
the statement is or is not reliable, but whether the authorities have done or
said anything that could have induced the accused to make a statement which was
or might be untrue.  It is of the utmost importance to keep in mind that the
inquiry is not concerned with reliability but with the authorities' conduct as
regards reliability.

 

                   Thus, to summarize the
discussion of the voir dire:  in the part of the voir dire
addressing the new rule, the trial judge must first satisfy him or herself that
the indicia of reliability necessary to admit hearsay evidence of prior
statements -- a warning, oath, solemn affirmation, or solemn declaration, and
videotape record, or sufficient substitutes -- are present and genuine.  If
they are, he or she must then examine the circumstances under which the
statement was obtained, to satisfy him or herself that the statement supported
by the indicia of reliability was made voluntarily if to a person in authority,
and that there are no other factors which would tend to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute if the statement was admitted as
substantive evidence.  In most cases, as in this case, the party seeking to
admit the prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence will have to
establish that these requirements have been satisfied on the balance of
probabilities.  The trial judge is not to decide whether the prior inconsistent
statement is true, or more reliable than the present testimony, as that is a
matter for the trier of fact.  Once this process is complete, and all of its
constituent elements satisfied, the trial judge need not issue the standard limiting
instruction to the jury, but may instead tell the jury that they may take the
statement as substantive evidence of its contents, or, if he or she is sitting
alone, make substantive use of the statement, giving the evidence the
appropriate weight after taking into account all of the circumstances.  In
either case, the judge must direct the trier of fact to consider carefully
these circumstances in assessing the credibility of the prior inconsistent
statement relative to the witness's testimony at trial.  For example, where
appropriate the trial judge might make specific reference to the significance
of the demeanour of the witness at all relevant times (which could include when
making the statement, when recanting at trial, and/or when presenting conflicting
testimony at trial), the reasons offered by the witness for his or her
recantation, any motivation and/or opportunity the witness had to fabricate his
or her evidence when making the previous statement or when testifying at trial,
the events leading up to the making of the first statement and the nature of
the interview at which the statement was made (including the use of leading
questions, and the existence of pre-statement interviews or coaching),
corroboration of the facts in the statement by other evidence, and the extent
to which the nature of the witness's recantation limits the effectiveness of
cross-examination on the previous statement.  There may be other factors the
trier of fact should consider, and the trial judge should impress upon the trier
of fact the importance of carefully assessing all such matters in determining
the weight to be afforded prior inconsistent statements as substantive
evidence. 

 

                   Where the prior statement does
not have the necessary circumstantial guarantees of reliability, and so cannot
pass the threshold test on the voir dire, but the party tendering the
prior statement otherwise satisfies the requirements of s. 9(1)  or (2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , the statement may still be tendered into evidence, but the
trial judge must instruct the jury in the terms of the orthodox rule.

 

VI - Disposition of This Appeal

 

                   In this case, while the
statements of the recanting witnesses were videotaped, and counsel for the
respondent had a full opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at trial, the
statements were not made under oath, solemn affirmation or by a solemn
declaration.  However, it may well be that sufficient substitutes for the oath
and warning as indicia of reliability exist in this case.  As this would be an
issue of central importance at any new trial ordered for the respondent, I will
express no opinion as to whether the new test is satisfied in this case beyond
saying that it is at least possible.  A trial judge might, having heard the
evidence respecting the circumstances under which these statements were made,
be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the statements are
sufficiently reliable to be substantively admissible.

 

                   In this case, the trial judge
(sitting without a jury) refused to even consider the admissibility of the
statements, considering himself bound by the orthodox rule.  With this
decision, the rule respecting prior inconsistent statements has been reformed. 
Given the trial judge's expressed belief that the witnesses were lying at trial,
it is possible that he might have found sufficient indicia of reliability to
admit the statements as substantive evidence.  I would therefore allow the
appeal and order a new trial at which the reformed rule relating to prior
inconsistent statements will, if necessary, be applied by the trial judge, who
will decide whether sufficient indicia of reliability and necessity are present
in this case, and instruct the trier of fact to afford the prior statements the
appropriate weight in reaching a verdict.

 

//Cory J.//

 

                   The reasons of L'Heureux-Dubé
and Cory JJ. were delivered by

 

                   Cory
J. -- At issue on this appeal is the
interpretation that should be given to the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-5 , s. 9 .  Until now the courts have interpreted this section to
permit the use of prior contradictory statements solely for the purpose of
attacking the credibility of the witness.  In this case the prior statements of
the witnesses were videotaped by the police during the course of their
investigation of the death by stabbing of Joseph Wright.  The videotaped
statements of the witnesses implicated the respondent K.G.B. as the person
responsible for the stabbing.  At the respondent's trial for murder, the three
witnesses recanted their earlier statements.  The trial judge found that they
were lying and that their earlier statements were true.  However, he noted that
he was bound by prior authority and was unable to accept the prior statements
as evidence and therefore could not use them to establish the identity of the
killer.  The trial judge was proven to be correct in his assessment of the
witnesses.  Subsequently, they were charged with perjury as a result of their
testimony at the trial and all three entered pleas of guilty to that charge.

 

                   I have read with interest the
excellent reasons of the Chief Justice.  I am in agreement with him that the
rule against the substantive use of prior statements must be changed; that this
Court is the appropriate institution to undertake the change; and that this
change can be effected without infringing the Charter  rights of an
accused person.  Further, I agree that a new trial must be ordered so that the
substantive admissibility of the statements in this case can be considered. 
However, with respect, I differ from him with regard to the nature of the new
rule.

 

                   The Chief Justice takes the
position that as a general rule, in order to be admissible, a prior
inconsistent statement must have been made under oath; the witness advised that
he or she may be subject to some form of criminal prosecution (other than
perjury) for falsehood; and the statement must be videotaped.  Alternatively,
he has determined that, exceptionally, substitutes for these requirements may
be found.  This involves an application of R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
531, and R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, which allow for hearsay to be
admitted if its introduction is necessary and the evidence is reliable.  With
the greatest respect I find the first component of the rule requiring
videotaping, a mandatory warning as to criminal liability for falsehood, and
the administration of the oath to be too restrictive.  Secondly, while I agree
that Khan and Smith provide an alternative justification for
changing the interpretation of s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act  set out
in Deacon v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 531, I do not think that their
unmodified application to prior inconsistent statements would adequately
protect the interests of the accused from the potential dangers that  surround
the introduction of statements made out of court.

 

I.  Factual Background

 

                   In order to demonstrate the
unfortunate result of the present rule, it is necessary for me to set out in
some detail the factual background of this case.  At 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, April
24, 1988, Joseph Wright and his brother Steven, got off a bus at the
corner of Morningside and Sheppard Avenues in Scarborough, Ontario.  A car
containing four young men, pulled up beside them and words were exchanged.  The
people in the car got out and a fight ensued.  Joseph Wright was slashed
twice in the face and stabbed in the heart.  This last wound caused his death. 
When Joseph Wright fell to the ground, the four young men got back into
the car and drove away.  The only issue at trial was which of the occupants of
the car had stabbed Joseph Wright.  The four occupants were the respondent
K.G.B., P.L. then 16 years of age, P.M. 17 years of age and
M.T. 16 years of age.  Steven Wright testified that only one occupant
of the car had a knife.  That person was black.  He saw him attacking his
brother with a knife.  He stated that, after stabbing his brother, this same
person had attempted to stab him as well.  The fact that Wright testified that
the man he saw attacking his brother with the knife was black is of significance
only because it eliminates as a suspect M.T., who is white. 

 

                   There were differences between
the description of the knife wielding attacker which Wright gave to the police
following the incident and the description contained in his testimony at trial.
 As well his description differed from the manner in which P.L., P.M. and M.T.
described the respondent.  These differences related to the relative darkness
of the attacker's complexion and the height and hair colour of K.G.B.  For what
it was worth, when he gave his evidence at the trial, Steven Wright
identified the accused as the man who had stabbed his brother.

 

A.  The Evidence of M.T. and the Circumstances
of his Prior Statement

 

                   M.T. learned that the police
wished to speak to him.  Some two weeks after the incident, on May 9, 1988, he,
in the company of his father, went to the police station.  When they arrived
the two investigating officers told them that while M.T. was not charged with
any offence, that he could have a lawyer present during the interview.  This
offer was declined.  At one point the interview was stopped in order to permit
M.T.'s father who was present at all times to call and consult a lawyer. 
Counsel advised him that since his son was not under arrest, there was no need
for legal assistance.  The police asked M.T. whether he would like another
relative present during the interview instead of his father.  He replied that
he did not.  He was later allowed to consult in private with his father.  The
officers explained that they were investigating the death of Joseph Wright
and that the statement was being videotaped.  One of the officers asked M.T. on
a number of occasions whether he was telling the truth.  On every occasion he
replied that he was.

 

                   During the course of the
videotaped interview, M.T. stated that all four occupants were at the
respondent's house the Sunday evening following the incident.  The respondent,
he said, then told him ""I shouldn't a used the knife ... I pulled it out
just to scare him thinking he would run away"".  The witness then
demonstrated to the officers the slashing motion that the respondent used while
he spoke these words.  On the Monday afternoon following the killing, the four
occupants of the car again met, this time in P.L.'s home.  At this time, the
respondent again said that he should not have used the knife.  The respondent
was also reported to have said that he threw the knife out.  M.T. told the
officers that the respondent was the only one of the four occupants of the car
who had a knife.

 

                   At trial, the testimony of
M.T. was radically different.  He stated that while there was a conversation at
the respondent's home after the stabbing, he could not hear what was being said
by the respondent.  He admitted to making the earlier videotaped statements to
the police but said that he was lying at the time because he was ""really
scared"".  He testified that he was telling the truth in the witness box
because he was under oath.

 

B.  Prior Statement and Evidence at Trial of
P.M.

 

                   The police came to P.M.'s home
to speak to him.  As a consequence of this visit he went to the police station
on May 6, accompanied by his mother.  He was told that he was not going to be
charged with any offence at that time.  He was advised that he could have a
lawyer or any adult relative present during the course of the interview.  He
asked to have his mother with him during the interview and this request was, of
course, granted.  He was told that the interview would be videotaped.  During
the interview he told the officers that the respondent K.G.B. ""usually
carries a knife"".  He said that during the fight ""he [K.G.B.] had the
knife open a little bit"".  He stated that the respondent told him that
""he had the knife open"".  At the end of the interview, both the
police and his mother asked him whether he had told the whole truth and he
replied that he had.

 

                   At trial, P.M. also changed
his story.  He testified that when he and M.T. and P.L. went to the
respondent's house, the respondent told him that he had heard nothing about
what had happened at Sheppard and Morningside, and the three then left.  P.M.
said that the statement that he had given to police earlier was
""lies"" to ""get myself out of it"".  He too denied that he
was lying to the court and said he was telling the truth because he was now
under oath.

 

C.  Prior Statement and the Evidence of P.L.
at Trial

 

                   At the suggestion of his
mother, P.L. went to the police station on May 6, 1988.  He was accompanied by
his brother, his mother and a lawyer who he had retained.  His brother and the
lawyer were with him throughout the interview.  He was told that he would be
given the opportunity to consult with the lawyer in private if he so wished. 
He was also told he was not obligated to say anything at all to the police. 
P.L.'s lawyer was of course permitted to intervene and did so on at least two
occasions during the interview.  In the videotaped interview he stated that
K.G.B. had explained that the stabbing was a ""fast reaction"" on his
part because the deceased had punched him in the eye.  

                   At trial, P.L., like the other
witnesses changed his testimony.  He said that he had lied at the police
station because he was ""just scared"" and wanted to get out of there. 
He thought he was telling the police what they wanted to hear.  He said that he
could not in fact hear what was being said in the conversation between P.M. and
the respondent regarding events on the night of the killing.  

 

II.  The Courts Below

 

Youth Court

 

                   The findings of Judge
MacDonnell at trial regarding the testimony of the three witnesses are
significant.  He found that the prior statements of the Crown witnesses' M.T.,
P.L. and P.M. independently identified the respondent as the person who
possessed and wielded the knife at the time of the incident.  He found that the
respondent's comments to the witnesses after the incident amounted to an
admission by K.G.B. that he had in fact stabbed the deceased.  He concluded
that the evidence of these witnesses given in court was ""lies"".  He
went on to find that the unsworn out of court statements constituted the true
version of events.

 

I have no doubt
their recantations are false.  That is, I have no doubt that on this point
they were telling the police the truth as they knew it about what the accused
said.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   He found that ""it [was]
simply unbelievable"" that the version given to the police by these
witnesses had been manufactured or that the three had collaborated before
speaking to the officers.  He concluded that the interviews conducted by the
police were ""completely above-board, proper, non-oppressive,
non-coercive"".  He observed that despite what ""common sense might
suggest"" he was not at liberty to believe the version of the events given
to the police in the prior statements.  He noted that if the version of events
given in the statements:

 

... did occur,
there would be substantial evidence to confirm the identification evidence
given earlier by Steven Wright, and the issue of the accused's use of the knife
might be resolved against him.

 

The trial judge viewed only short extracts of the
police videotape in reaching these conclusions.  It would of course be
preferable for a trial judge to view the entire tape.  However, there is no
doubt that in this case the parties consented to the trial judge making his
assessment based on those extracts of the videotape which were viewed and the
complete transcript which he read.  He found that the uncorroborated in court
""dock"" identification of K.G.B. by Steven Wright could not be the
basis of a conviction.  Since he could not consider the prior statements as
evidence, he acquitted the respondent.

 

Court of Appeal (1991), 49 O.A.C. 30

 

                   The Court of Appeal upheld the
acquittal and dismissed the Crown's appeal.  It decided that it was bound by
the decisions of this Court which held that prior inconsistent statements could
only be used to test the credibility of the witness.

 

III.The
Arguments Against the Use of Prior Contradictory Statements for Substantive
purposes 

 

                   Let us consider first the
arguments that have been raised against the admission of prior contradictory
statements as evidence.  

 

A.  The Absence of the Oath

 

                   The Chief Justice has set out
in his reasons the concerns that have been expressed regarding the admission of
prior contradictory statements for substantive purposes.  Perhaps the foremost
concern is that the prior statement is not given under oath.  Indeed the Chief
Justice has made the oath a prerequisite to admissibility except in exceptional
circumstances where an adequate substitute may be found.  Courts have always
stressed the importance of the oath.  In medieval times the taking of an oath
to tell the truth by placing a bare hand upon a sacred object was of
fundamental importance.  It was firmly believed that to defy the oath by lying
would lead to divine retribution that would include punishment in this earthly
life and eternal damnation in the hereafter.  However, the medieval fear of
damnation has diminished.  Similarly the influence of religion in the affairs
of men and women has decreased.  There can be little doubt that the taking of
an oath is frequently no more than a meaningless ritualistic incantation for
many witnesses.  In earlier times there may have been good reason for attaching
greater weight to testimony given under oath than to unsworn statements given
by the same witness.  Today, an increasingly secular society simply attaches
less significance to taking an oath.  To many witnesses, the oath adds nothing
to the reliability of their evidence.

 

                   Nor can the fear of secular
punishment of imprisonment arising from perjury be considered to be a sure
means of ensuring truthful testimony.  There can be no better demonstration of
the proposition that the swearing of a witness to tell the truth has little
effect than this very case.  Here, despite the taking of the oath by the three
witnesses, they lied in court and were convicted of perjury for those lies. 
The truth was told in their videotaped statements to the police.  The facts of
this case make it clear that in today's society the taking of the oath by
witnesses does not guarantee that they will tell the truth.  

 

                   Various jurisdictions in the
United States have struggled with the same issue.  On the one hand, there is
the desire to ensure that prior inconsistent statements are reliable so that
they can be considered and assessed for all purposes by the triers of fact, on
the other hand, is the need to assure a fair trial for the accused.  Either as
a result of legislation or decisions of the courts four American positions can
be identified.  First are those states where prior inconsistent statements will
as a general rule be admitted for their truth value (15 states).  Second,
there are states where the prior statements will be admitted so long as there
is some indicia presented to the court of their reliability (7 states). 
Third are those states and the Federal Rules of Evidence which requires the
prior statement to have been made under oath in order to be admissible
(23 states and the Federal Rules).  Fourth, those states and the District
of Columbia where the prior statements are not admissible (5 states and the
District of Columbia).

 

                   It may be helpful to consider
the Federal Rule and its history.  That rule provides:

 

Rule 801.  ...

 

                   (d)
Statements which are not hearsay.  -- A statement is not hearsay if --

 

                   (1)
Prior statement by witness. -- The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing
and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement
is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was given under oath
subject to the  penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or
in a deposition....  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   It is significant that the
inclusion of the oath in the present American rule, was the result of a
political compromise late in the legislative process.  The Advisory Committee
on the new federal rules, appointed by the then Chief Justice Warren, of the
United States Supreme Court, had recommended that prior inconsistent statements
be generally admissible provided only that the witness had contradicted himself
and could be cross-examined on the earlier statement.  See M. H. Graham
""Employing Inconsistent Statements for Impeachment and as Substantive
Evidence:  A Critical Review and Proposed Amendments of Federal Rules of
Evidence 801(d)(1)(A), 613, and 607"" (1977), 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1565,
at pp. 1565, 1575-76).  The American Senate as well expressed the view that the
oath was not necessary as a precondition.  The following appears from the Senate
record:

 

                   The
requirement that the statement be under oath also appears unnecessary. 
Notwithstanding the absence of an oath contemporaneous with the statement, the
witness, when on the stand, qualifying or denying the prior statement, is under
oath.

 

(Senate Report
No. 93-1277, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), reprinted in [1974] U.S. Cong.
& Adm. News 7051, at p. 7062.)

 

                   Indeed Professor E. W. Clearly
pointed out before the Senate committee that a rule requiring an oath could go
far to destroy the utility of the proposed provision with regard to
inconsistent statements.  He stated:

 

... [it] would
virtually destroy the utility of provision (A), which deals with prior
inconsistent statements.  If the witness has made a prior statement under oath,
the threat of a perjury charge makes it highly unlikely that he will
subsequently relate a different story again under oath.  Hence the instances in
which the rule would operate under the suggested redraft would be greatly
curtailed.  The problem area consists of cases in which the prior statement was
not under oath, whether in the course of a judicial proceeding or not, and a
rule which does not deal with these cases is of no practical significance.

 

                   (Graham, supra, at p.
1577, note 40.)

 

                   A House of Representatives
bill would have required both contemporaneous cross-examination and an oath
before an inconsistent statement could be admitted.  As a result, a compromise
was struck which reconciled the House and Senate bills by requiring that the
oath be retained as a part of the rule in exchange for dropping the need for
contemporaneous cross-examination.

 

                    Thus, in the United States,
an oath is required at the time of the earlier statement despite the fact that
the declarant, in the case of a prior inconsistent statement, must also be a
witness before the court testifying under oath.

 

                   I think that the retention of
the oath as a condition of admissibility should not be imported into Canada. 
This is especially true since neither the provisions of the Criminal Code 
nor the rationale of this Court in R. v. Boisjoly, [1972] S.C.R. 42,
could result in a conviction for perjury arising from a sworn declaration made
in the course of a criminal investigation.  In Boisjoly, police charged
an individual with making a false statement under oath contrary to what was
then Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 114.  The police believed
that Boisjoly had lied to them in a sworn statement which dealt with his
involvement in the coercion of a witness at a preliminary inquiry.  Fauteux
C.J., for an unanimous Court, held that even if the affidavit were deceitful,
the accused was not liable for making a false statement.  In his opinion, s.
114 only applied to a person ""permitted"" by law to make sworn
declarations.  He found that ""permitted"" could not mean simply
""not prohibited"" since the legislative history demonstrated that the
purpose of the section was to limit the circumstances in which oaths would be
administered.  Indeed, the equivalent section found in an earlier Canadian
statute, S.C. 1874, c. 37, was headed Unnecessary Oaths Suppression. 
Fauteux C.J. was unable to find in any relevant legislation a provision
empowering witnesses to make sworn statements to police.  He concluded (at
p. 51):

 

The legislator
does not recognize as an ingredient of the indictable offence mentioned in s.
114, affidavits which he has not permitted, authorized or required, in short
affidavits which have no legal meaning or scope.

 

                   At the time of that case,
perjury was restricted to witnesses who lied in the course of a judicial
proceeding (s. 112).  Since then, the Criminal Law Amendment Acts of
1975 and 1985 (S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s. 6, and S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 17) have
amalgamated ss. 112 and 114 and provide for one broader offence of perjury. 
The language considered in Boisjoly thereby finds its way into perjury
under what is now s. 131(3).  Section 114 stated that:

 

                   114. Every one who, not being a witness in a
judicial proceeding but being permitted, authorised or required by law to
make a statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath,
makes in such a statement, before a person who is authorised by law to permit
it to be made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact,
opinion, belief or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. 
[Emphasis added.] 

 

This wording is now found at s. 131 .  Section
131(1) creates the offence of perjury and s. 131(3) provides:

 

                   (3)
Subsection (1) does not apply to a statement referred to in that
subsection that is made by a person who is not specially permitted,
authorized or required by law to make that statement.   [Emphasis added.]

 

The rationale of Boisjoly is therefore
applicable to the current perjury provisions. 

However, the 1975 amendments also created a new
offence for persons, who while not specially permitted to do so, make sworn
statements that are discovered to be false.  This new offence is found at s.
134(1) of the Code.  However it contains the following exception:

 

(2) Subsection
(1) does not apply to a statement referred to in that subsection that is made
in the course of a criminal investigation.

 

Thus it is not applicable to the type of
statements under consideration in this case.

 

                   I note in passing that the
decision in Boisjoly has been applied in a case involving a prior
inconsistent statement.  In Coulombe v. La Reine, [1976] C.A. 327, a
witness (later charged with murder) gave to police, in the course of their
investigation, a sworn statement and contradicted it at trial.  The Quebec
Court of Appeal held that the witness could not be found guilty of perjury for
making the earlier statement. 

 

                   With the greatest of respect
for the contrary view, to make the oath one of the initial requirements for
admissibility of a prior statement when no criminal consequences may be
attached to the oath would seem to be an exercise in hollow formalism.  In the
case at bar,  the requirement of administering the oath would render the prior
statement inadmissible.  Yet it was the prior statements that were true not the
sworn testimony of the witnesses.  The requirement would prevent the trier of
fact from ever hearing the truth and would make impossible the rendering of a
true verdict.  I would think that the trier of fact, whether judge or jury,
should be permitted to assess the truth of a prior statement provided it has
met the requisite indicia of reliability in order to be admitted. 

 

                   The facts of this very case
make it abundantly clear that neither the taking of the oath nor the
possibility of perjury charges resulting from their testimony can in themselves
ensure that a witness will tell the truth.  It follows that the administration
of the oath should not be a prerequisite to the admissibility of a prior
inconsistent statement.  Rather it is the reliability of the statement that
should determine its admissibility.  That reliability will depend on a number
of factors.  One of these will be whether the witness as a result of making the
statement may be subject to criminal prosecution for some offence (not just but
including perjury) if the statement is false.

 

 

                                       Alternative
Sources of Criminal Liability

 

                   A prior inconsistent statement
could become admissible as evidence if the witness may be subject to criminal
prosecution if that prior statement were false. 

 

                   A witness giving a
deliberately false statement to the police may be subject to prosecution for a
number of offences other than perjury.  They include fabricating evidence,
contrary to s. 137  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , which
provides a maximum of 14 years; obstructing justice, contrary to s. 139(2) 
providing a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment or public mischief, contrary to
s. 140 , with a maximum penalty of 5 years.  As an example, of these offences
ss. 139(2)  and 140  provide:

 

                   139. ...

                   (2)
Every one who wilfully attempts in any manner other than a manner described in
subsection (1) to obstruct, pervert or defeat the cause of justice is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten
years.

 

                   140. (1) Every one commits public mischief who, with
intent to mislead, causes a peace officer to enter on or continue an
investigation by

 

(a) 
making a false statement that accuses some other person of having committed an
offence;

 

(b)
doing anything intended to cause some other person to be suspected of having
committed an offence that the other person has not committed, or to divert
suspicion from himself;

 

(c)
reporting that an offence has been committed when it has not been committed; or

 

(d)
reporting or in any other way making it known or causing it to be made known
that he or some other person has died when he or that other person has not
died.

 

                   In 1985, s. 140  was
expanded, R.S.C., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 19 (formerly S.C. 1985, c. 19,
s. 19), to include falsehoods that cause police to continue investigations as
well as those falsehoods that cause investigations to be initiated.  Unlike the
offence of perjury, there is no requirement for corroboration in order to
establish these offences.  These offences would, I think, be as well known to
members of the community, including prospective witnesses as that of perjury. 
Indeed, it is apparent that the Crown is more likely to prosecute under one of
these provisions than it is to proceed with a charge for perjury.  It is the
existence of these offences and the possibility of prosecution for their breach
that goes far in assuring the truthfulness and reliability of the statement.   

 

                   It is true that a witness has
no legal obligation to assist the police in their investigation.  See the
reasons of Martin J.A. in R. v. Moran (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.
C.A.).  Yet once a witness does speak to the police in the course of their
investigations, they must not mislead the investigating authorities by making
statements that are false.  The right to say nothing cannot protect a witness
from the consequences of deliberately making a false statement.  See, for
example, R. v. L.S.L. (1991), 89 Sask. R. 267 (Q.B.).

 

                   There are a great many cases
where persons have been prosecuted for obstruction of justice as a result of
giving one version of the facts to the police,   while offering a different
version when testifying as a witness.  In some of the cases, the factual
situation was very similar to that presented in this case.  See, for example, R.
v. Gravelle (1952), 103 C.C.C. 250 (Ont.  Mag. Ct.), and R. v.
MacGillivray (1971), 3 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 227 (P.E.I. Co. Ct.).  There
are a number of cases where there has been a prosecution for obstructing justice,
fabricating evidence or for public mischief as result of a witness falsely
accusing another of a crime.  This list is put forward simply as an example of
the number of cases where this type of prosecution has been brought:  R. v.
Feger (1989), 36 Q.A.C. 26; R v. J.(J.) (1988), 65 C.R. (3d) 371
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, [1989] 1 S.C.R. ix; R.
v. Stapleton (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 231 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Howard
(1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (Ont. C.A.); Lessard v. La Reine, [1965] Que. Q.B.
631; R. v. Sevick (1930), 54 C.C.C. 92 (N.S.S.C. en banc), and at
the trial level:  R. v. Edwards (1986), 47 Sask. R. 303 (Q.B.); R. v.
Verma (1980), 28 A.R. 233 (Q.B.);  R. v. Lindstrom (1977), 33 N.S.R.
(2d) 369 (Co. Ct.); R. v. Martin (1969), 12 Crim. L.Q. 201
(B.C. Prov. Ct.); and R. v. Snider (1953), 17 C.R. 136 (Ont. Mag. Ct.).

 

                   The number of these cases
seems to make it questionable that it is essential that a warning should be
given to a prospective witness of the possibility of prosecution.  A person who
gives a false statement to the investigating authorities causes the police to
spend time in futile investigation of the false allegations.  This obviously
entails the expenditure of both a great deal of police time and the expenditure
of public funds.  Indeed by directing the attention of the police to others the
real perpetrator of the crime may escape.  Thus the rationale behind the
offence of obstructing justice makes good common sense and can be readily
understood by members of the community.  Canadians would accept and indeed
expect that witnesses who make deliberately false statements to the police
would be subject to criminal prosecution.

 

                   This is such an obvious
proposition and would appear to be such a part of the common knowledge of the
community that there is no more need to warn persons that they may be liable to
prosecution if the statements they give to police are false than to warn them
of charges of perjury if their sworn statements are false.  It follows that,
although it would clearly be preferable to give a warning to a witness of the
possibility of criminal proceedings if that person gives a false statement, it
may not be essential to give such a warning in order to render the statement
admissible.

 

                    It seems clear that criminal
prosecutions for offences other than perjury are frequently brought against
witnesses who make false statements.  The consequences of a conviction for
these offences are serious.  I cannot find that there is a significant
difference between the penalty for perjury for a witness lying at trial and the
penalty for offences such as obstructing justice.  The less stringent
requirements for prosecution for obstructing justice or for public mischief
(which unlike perjury do not require corroboration) and the more frequent
prosecutions for these offences would, I think, have a deterrent effect upon
those who might be prone to make false statements.  Further since liability for
these offences does not rest in any way on the oath, the requirement that it be
administered could have no practical effect.

 

                   In summary, the administering
of an oath or solemn affirmation should no longer be regarded as an essential
safeguard for ensuring the veracity of a statement.  Neither the threat of
divine retribution resulting in eternal damnation nor a prosecution for perjury
can guarantee truthfulness.  If the witness giving the statement is subject to
criminal prosecution for making a deliberately false statement, that will serve
as a deterrent to mendacity and encouragement to veracity.  A requirement that
the police administer an oath to the witness cannot further deter the witness
from lying and would seem to be superfluous.  The absence of the oath should
not presumptively stand in the way of the admissibility for substantive
purposes of a prior inconsistent statement.

 

B.  Absence of Contemporaneous
Cross-examination

 

                   It is true also that at the
time of the statement the witness was not subjected to the rigours of
cross-examination.  However, if the prior statement is ruled admissible then
the witness will be subject to cross-examination at trial and the trier of fact
will be able to study the demeanour of the witness throughout the testimony and
can assess what weight if any should be attached to all the evidence of the
witness including the prior statement.  Two diametrically opposed views may be
taken of the prior inconsistent statement.  First it might be thought that the
earlier statement resulted from coercion or pressure brought to bear on a
witness by the investigating authorities.  Yet it may just as well be concluded
that the courtroom recantation arose from pressure brought upon the witness
prior to the trial by the accused, his friends or associates.  Either of these
scenarios may be fully explored in examination and cross-examination and
assessed by the trier of fact. 

 

                   Alternatively the court may be
confronted with a witness who forgets the earlier statement and the events
related in that statement.  Once again assuming that there is a complete and
reliable transcript of the earlier statement, the nature of the memory loss can
be explored at trial with the sworn witness.  The voir dire procedure
which will be outlined later will provide protection for the accused and the
witness.  If the prior statement has met the other conditions of reliability
that I will refer to, then it should be admitted, for it may better enable a
verdict to be reached on the basis of the truth derived from all the relevant
evidence.  A true verdict reached upon properly admissible evidence must be the
goal of all court proceedings.

 

 

C.  The Lack of Evidence as to Demeanour

 

                   Those who have argued against
the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement have put forward the
position that the trier of fact is unable to see the witness at the time the
statement was made.  It is the lack of opportunity to observe the witness that
is the basis for the traditional reticence of appellate Courts to interfere
with the findings of fact and especially the findings of credibility made by
triers of fact. Thus deprived of the ability to observe the demeanour of the
witness, the trier will be unable to reach any conclusion as to the truth of
the prior statement.

 

                   There is some inconsistency in
this position for the witness at the time of trial is indeed before the trier
of fact.  At that time a conclusion can be reached as to which of the two statements
is true.  That conclusion will no doubt be based in part upon the in court
demeanour of the witness.

 

                   The refusal to admit a prior
inconsistent statement based on the inability of the jury to observe the
witness at the time the prior statement was made, has been considered and
rejected by the United States Supreme Court.  In California v. Green,
399 U.S. 149 (1970), the United States Supreme Court considered a California
law authorizing the substantive use of all prior inconsistent statements.  It
was argued that this legislation violated the right of the accused to confront
all the witnesses called against him guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  The
majority of the court concluded that the legislation did not infringe the
constitutional right.  On this issue the majority stated (at pp. 160 and
188):

 

... some
demeanor evidence that would have been relevant in resolving this credibility
issue is forever lost.

 

                                                                    ...

 

[But] the
witness may be examined at trial as to the circumstances of memory, opportunity
to observe, meaning, and veracity.... I think it fair to say that the fact that
the jury has no opportunity to reconstruct a witness' demeanor at the time of
his declaration, and the absence of oath are minor considerations.

 

                   The same conclusion had been
reached earlier by Learned Hand J. in  Di Carlo v. United States, 6
F.2d 364 (2d Cir. 1925).  He observed at p. 368 that the recanting witness:

 

... is present
before the jury, and they may gather the truth from his whole conduct and
bearing, even if it be in respect of contradictory answers he may have made at
other times....  If, from all that the jury see of the witness, they conclude
that what he says now is not the truth, but what he said before, they are
none the less deciding from what they see and hear of that person and in court. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Thus even without a videotape
reproduction of the taking of the statement there is strong authority for
concluding that the mere fact that the witness could not be observed when the
original statement was made should not be a ground for making that statement
inadmissible.  The rights of the accused are protected by the cross-examination
of the witness at the time of trial.  It will often arise that, as a result of
cross-examination, the witness will, as in this case, deny the truth of the
earlier statement.  No better result could be expected of the most brilliant
cross-examination.  It will then be for the trier of fact to determine which
version is correct.

 

                   In any event, in this case we
are dealing with videotaped evidence.  The videotape shows the witness sitting
at a table.  In a corner of the screen there is a close-up of the witness's
face.  At the bottom of the picture there is a time clock sequence which
ensures the integrity of the tape.  The videotaping of the statement provides
such a complete record not only of the questions posed and the answers given,
but of the demeanour of the witness throughout the interview that little can be
said to warrant its exclusion based on the inability to assess the demeanour of
the witness when the statement was made.

 

                   In passing, I would observe
that the videotape serves as well to monitor the conduct of the police during
the interview.  It goes far to ensuring that nothing untoward happened in the
course of the interview.  The usefulness of the videotape of an interview was
aptly described by A. Heaton-Armstrong and D. Wolchover in ""Recording
Witness Statements"", [1992] Crim. L.R. 160, at p. 169:

 

                   The
more accurate and comprehensive the record of a statement the stronger the case
becomes for introducing it as evidence of the facts contained in it.  There is
a world of difference between a conventional witness statement signed by the
maker but written by a police officer and a video-recorded interview with a
witness which will include the questions and other potentially important
features such as witness's demeanour, in modern parlance non-verbal
communication or, as it is popularly known ""body language"". 

 

                   It may on occasion be cogently
argued that police pressure was exerted upon the witness prior to the taping. 
That need not be considered in this case as parents, lawyers or family members
were present with the witnesses from the time they came to the police station
until the interview was completed.

 

                   The videotaped statement with
its complete and comprehensive record of the questions posed, the answers given
and the demeanour of the witness, will often serve as a complete answer to the
issues of reliability and voluntariness of the statement.  However, it is not
essential that a statement be videotaped in order to be admissible.  It may
well be that other situations will be presented where a complete and
comprehensive record will be preserved of the statement together with
satisfactory evidence of the circumstances of the interview and the demeanour
of the witness so that all the requirements on this count will be met.  For
example a recorded statement made by a witness in front of the police and
independent, reliable persons may well meet all the criteria of reliability and
be just as acceptable for purposes of admissibility as a videotaped statement. 
If the prior statement, while not videotaped, meets all the criteria of
reliability it should be admissible.

 

                   The argument based on the inability
to assess the demeanour of the witness at the time of the original statement
should not be accepted as grounds for excluding the videotaped statement with
which we are concerned.

 

D.  Possibility of Coercion

 

                   The common law has a long
history of resistance to the use of testimony that was compiled from the
depositions and letters of persons who were never called to testify.  There is
a healthy fear that the authorities may be so anxious to secure a conviction that
they will exert unwarranted pressure on a witness to obtain the statement which
they desire.  The rule against the substantive admissibility of a prior
inconsistent statement had the salutary effect of allowing a witness to
reconsider the earlier statements in court where the presence of a judge would
overcome any perceived coercion by the police.  

 

                   A new rule that would admit
the statements if certain conditions are met should ensure that the prior
statement of the witness was made voluntarily.  It should still permit the
witness to recant and to explain that the earlier statement resulted from
police pressure or coercion.  Yet it must be remembered that the police are not
the only ones who can exert pressure on a witness.  The accused, or friends and
supporters of the accused can as well influence a witness to change a
statement.  This may be particularly true in drug cases and cases of spousal
assault.  Obviously, the incentive of an accused to have a witness change his
version of events is substantial if the present rule is maintained since the
retraction by itself can effectively end the prosecution's case.  Frequently
this will frustrate any possibility of the resolution of the charge on its
merits.  

 

                   The Supreme Court of Georgia
observed in Gibbons v. State, 286 S.E.2d 717 (1982), that a rule
allowing for the substantial admissibility of prior declarations means that (at
p. 722):

 

... both sides
are assured a measure of protection against efforts to influence the testimony
of a witness, as the prior declaration is no longer effectively
revocable at the will of the witness. 

 

                   For
the same considerations, witnesses are protected from improper attempts to
influence testimony -- the potential gain from impropriety being diminished
substantially by the adoption of this rule.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

It will always be vitally important to ensure
that there has been no impropriety or abuse of the power of the state in
obtaining the prior statement.  Thus the court must make certain that a
statement of a witness that may be later used against the accused despite its
repudiation of it by the witness at trial, has been freely and voluntarily
made.  This can be accomplished in much the same way that courts presently
ensure that confessions were not improperly obtained.  I would therefore
recommend that before the prior statement can be found to be admissible under
s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act  that a voir dire be held to
ensure that the statement  was freely and voluntarily made.  In the case at
bar, the trial judge found that the police conduct was ""completely
above-board, proper, non-oppressive, non-coercive"".  That I think is the
proper standard to be applied in reviewing the statement.  

 

                   At the conclusion of the voir
dire the trial judge should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
statement was given voluntarily in an atmosphere that was as free of oppression
as possible and did not result from the hope of reward or the fear of penalty. 


 

IV.  The Conditions for Admissibility Which
Must be Satisfied on the Voir Dire

 

                   There are a number of matters
that must be explored on the voir dire.  It may be useful to set out at
this point the manner in which it should be conducted and the issues it should
resolve.

 

                   The voir dire should
proceed in the usual way.  As the Chief Justice noted, the prior statement must
be otherwise admissible and not excluded by the operation of some other
evidentiary rule such as those reviewed by him.  In the case at bar, the prior
inconsistent statements of the witnesses set out incriminating statements made
by the respondent, which would ordinarily be admissible.

 

                   Upon the voir dire the
trial judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the conditions for
admitting the prior inconsistent statement have been fulfilled.  I would
suggest that the conditions are these:

 

(1) That the
evidence contained in the prior statement is such that it would be admissible
if given in court.

 

(2) That the
statement has been made voluntarily by the witness and is not the result of any
undue pressure, threats or inducements.

 

(3) That the
statement was made in circumstances, which viewed objectively would bring home
to the witness the importance of telling the truth.

 

(4) That the
statement is reliable in that it has been fully and accurately transcribed or
recorded.

 

(5) That the
statement was made in circumstances that the witness would be liable to
criminal prosecution for giving a deliberately false statement.

 

If those conditions are met then the prior inconsistent
statement should be admitted for all purposes.

 

                   The statements to be
considered on such a voir dire will fall somewhere along a continuum of
reliability.  For example, at one end it may be established that the statement
had been videotaped; the witness had access to counsel; the witness had a
relative or responsible person present throughout the interrogation; the
witness had been made aware of the gravity of the investigation and the
importance of telling the truth; and the witness gave the statement
voluntarily.  Statements made in those circumstances may be readily admitted. 
Other statements may still be found to be reliable and admissible although they
do not present every one of the foregoing indicia of trustworthiness.  For
example, there may not be a videotape, but a recording of the interview made in
the presence of dependable and reliable independent witnesses who attended the
interview and who attest to the demeanour and deportment of the witness and the
police.  At the other end of the continuum may be a prior inconsistent
statement contained in the hurried notes of a single police officer who was
paraphrasing the words of the witness speaking to him  in hectic and difficult
circumstances.  It might well be difficult to conclude that such a statement
should be admitted.  

 

A.  Standard of Proof on the Voir Dire

 

                   The Chief Justice would decide
the question of admissibility on a balance of probabilities.  The jurisprudence
on the burden to be satisfied during a voir dire is meagre.

 

                   This Court in deciding what
standard of proof is to be adopted in particular circumstances -- beyond a
reasonable doubt or on a balance of probabilities -- has taken a flexible
approach.  The standard selected is the result of a policy decision which is
based upon a balancing of the interests of the accused and of the public which
are at stake.  See R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 137-38, and R.
v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at pp. 973-76.  For example, the impact of a
confession on a trial requires that its voluntariness be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt before it is admitted:  R. v. Pickett (1975), 28 C.C.C.
(2d) 297 (Ont. C.A.).

 

                   A confession is an inculpatory
statement made by an accused to a person in authority.  In the case at
bar the admission of the respondent was made to his friends who were clearly
not persons in authority.  While the admissions were inculpatory, they were not
confessions.  The concern that statements were forced out of the accused by police
is simply not present in this case.

 

                     However, the witnesses when
they attended at the police station  were in a sense under police control. 
Therefore, in the interests of fairness and uniformity, the same high standard
should be applied to all prior statements.  It would not only be in the best
interest of the accused but also ensure the fairness of the trial process if
the judge presiding over the voir dire were required to be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt as to all the aspects of the statement.  If the
reliability of the prior statement is so tenuous or marginal that only the
civil standard would secure its admissibility, it is not the type of evidence
that should be placed before the trier of fact in a criminal trial.

 

                   The Chief Justice leaves open
the question whether a confession by an accused that forms part of a prior
inconsistent statement should be admissible on a balance of probabilities.  In
my view, it matters little whether the confession is directly admitted or goes
before the jury in the form of a prior inconsistent statement -- in both cases
the test to be met on the voir dire should be proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 

                   The judge conducting the voir
dire should not weigh the credibility of the statement any more than would
the judge conducting a voir dire concerning a confession determine
whether it is truthful.  The voir dire simply ensures that the
circumstances surrounding the making of the statement are such, that it should
be admitted.  It is for the jury to determine whether the prior statement
should be accepted as true.

 

B.  Instructions to the Jury

 

                   If at the conclusion of the voir
dire the prior inconsistent statement is ruled admissible for all purposes
then at some time the trial judge should give instructions to the jury
regarding the statement.

 

                   The jury should be advised
that although the statement has been ruled admissible it is up to them to
decide what weight if any they should attach to it.  The jury should be
instructed that they may consider that the statement should be given less
weight because it was not subject to cross-examination at the time it was made
and because there was not the same opportunity to assess the demeanour of the
witness as there would have been had the statement been made in court.  Nonetheless,
the statement is to be treated like any other admissible evidence.  It can be
accepted as the truth of what it relates, it can be accepted in part and
rejected in part; or it can be rejected completely.  In assessing the statement
the jury should consider all the circumstances in which it was made.

 

V.  The Test in Smith and Khan

 

                   Before giving a demonstration
of how a voir dire in this case might proceed, I should touch upon the
second facet of the Chief Justice's reasons which deals with statements where
one, several, or all of the three initial preconditions (oath, warning and
videotape) are missing.  For the Chief Justice when such a situation arises,
""alternatively"" in ""exceptional circumstances"" the
principles enunciated in Smith and Khan should apply.  That is to
say the judge, on the voir dire, is to search for substitute indicia of
reliability.

 

                   There is no doubt that these
cases provide an alternative justification for changing this Court's
oft-criticized ruling in Deacon, supra.  I have no quarrel with
utilizing the approach to hearsay evidence set out in Khan and Smith
to prior inconsistent statements provided the threshold tests for reliability I
have suggested are made a part of it.    

 

VI.  Application of the Conditions of
Admissibility to the Case at Bar

 

                   Let us see how these suggested
conditions of admissibility could be applied to this case. I do so not to reach
any conclusion on the question of admissibility but to demonstrate how the
analysis I have proposed might be applied in this case.

 

(1)  Otherwise
Admissible

 

                   The evidence contained in the
prior statements would be admissible if given in court.

 

                   (2)  Voluntariness

 

                   In this case each witness was
advised that he had a right to counsel.  Each witness had a lawyer or a parent
or sibling or a combination of those persons present during the interrogation. 
The videotape of the interviews certainly did not disclose evidence of any
impropriety on the part of the police.  The trial judge congratulated the
police for their sensitive handling of the matter.  Indeed the police did act
in an exemplary manner.  They scrupulously and carefully advised the witnesses
of their rights, the nature of the investigation and the importance of telling
the truth.  There is no evidence that undue influence was exerted upon the
witnesses, nor were they threatened or offered a reward of any kind.  It
follows that it would be open to the judge presiding at the voir dire to
find that the prior statements were made voluntarily.

 

(3)  The
Importance of Telling the Truth

 

                   All witnesses attended at the
police station with family members and one with a lawyer as well.  They were
told that the police were investigating the death by stabbing of
Joseph Wright.  They were all advised of the importance of telling the
truth.  The police went so far as to tell one witness of the possibility of
criminal charges being brought against him if he was not telling the truth. 
When all the circumstances are considered, it would seem that it should have
been apparent to the witnesses that it was important to tell the truth. 
Certainly it would be open to a trial judge sitting on a voir dire to
reach such a conclusion.

 

(4) 
Reliability of the Statement

 

                   The videotape demonstrates the
reliability of the statement.  It is a complete and accurate recording of the
questions posed and the answers given.  It reveals the tone of voice and the
facial expression of the witnesses.  The tape provides such a complete and
reliable record of the statement and the circumstances in which it was given
that it would be open to the judge conducting the voir dire to find the
statements were reliable.

 

(5)Witness
Subject to Criminal Prosecution if a Deliberately False Statement Was Given

 

                   All the witnesses were subject
to criminal prosecution for obstructing justice or public mischief if their
statements were deliberately false.  One witness was advised of this in general
terms.  All were advised of the importance of telling the truth.  Here the
statements were made in circumstances that could give rise to criminal
prosecution of the witnesses if their statements were deliberately false.

 

                   In this case, it would be open
to a judge conducting a voir dire at a new trial to find that the prior
inconsistent statements met all the conditions for admissibility.

 

VII.  New Trial

 

                   The respondent argued that if
it were found that the prior inconsistent statements were admissible for all
purposes that there would still not be sufficient evidence to convict the
accused.  Reliance was placed upon Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R.
277.  I cannot agree with that submission.  The words of the trial judge on
this issue are significant.  He stated that if the witnesses' statements to the
police could be considered

 

there would be
substantial evidence to confirm the identification evidence given earlier by
Steven Wright, and the issue of the accused's use of the knife might be
resolved against him.

 

                   This clearly indicates that on
a new trial, if the prior inconsistent statements were found to be admissible,
the result could well be different, that is to say the verdict would not
necessarily be the same.

 

                   It must be remembered that a
young man died as a result of a senseless stabbing.  The community has a real
and pressing interest in having the guilt or innocence of the respondent
established on the basis of the truth.  The earlier acquittal was based upon perjured
evidence and upon an interpretation of s. 9  of the Canada Evidence Act 
that withheld the truth -- in the form of the prior statements -- from the
consideration of the trial judge.  Those statements might well have been
considered.  A trial must always be a quest to discover the truth.  Irrational
and unreasonable obstacles to the admission of evidence should not impede that
quest.  In order to reach a true verdict a court must be able to consider all
the relevant admissible evidence.  It is only on a new trial, when a court has
had the opportunity to consider anew the admissibility of the prior statements,
that an informed decision may be reached based upon all the admissible
evidence.

 

VIII.  Disposition

 

                   In the result, I would allow
the appeal, set aside the acquittal and the order of the Court of Appeal
upholding the acquittal and direct a new trial.

 

                   Appeal allowed and new trial
ordered.

                   Appellant was
alleged to have sexually assaulted his niece from when she was six to eight
years old through to age sixteen.  The complainant had been in his care as a
child during the fifties and sixties and only left her parents' household in
1964 after being discovered in the act of intercourse with her.  The alleged
assaults were reported to the police in 1990 and appellant was charged with
rape, assault and procuring an abortion.

 

                   During the course
of the trial, the judge decided on a voir dire not to admit the evidence
of the complainant's sister that she too had been sexually assaulted by the
appellant, on the ground that it fell within the similar fact evidence rule and
its prejudicial effect was not outweighed by its probative value.  However,
testimony of the complainant's brothers and sisters was admitted with respect
to the violent control that the appellant exerted within the household. 
Appellant was convicted of rape and assault and was unsuccessful in his appeal
to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal.  He had sought to have declared
inadmissible those parts of her brothers' testimony relating to assaults by the
appellant on the complainant's siblings.  Given a dissenting opinion, an appeal
as of right arose on this point.

 

                   At issue here was: 
(1) whether the evidence of the brothers was inadmissible on the ground
that it was oath‑helping evidence; (2) whether this evidence was
inadmissible because it was irrelevant to any issue other than the appellant's
character or that its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value;
(3) if the evidence was admissible, whether the trial judge should have
given the jury special instructions about the use they could make of this
testimony; and finally, (4) whether the appeal should be dismissed under
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  on the ground that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

 

                   Held (L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Sopinka and Iacobucci
JJ.:  The question of whether or not the evidence was inadmissible on
the ground of being oath‑helping evidence was not discussed by the Court
of Appeal and therefore was not a ""question of law on which a judge of the
court of appeal dissent[ed].""  Consequently, the appellant could not raise
this as an issue before this Court.

 

                   The rule against
oath‑helping prohibits a party from presenting evidence solely for the
purpose of bolstering a witness' credibility before that witness' credibility
is attacked.  This type of evidence tends to prove the truthfulness of the
witness, rather than the truth of the witness' statements.  The testimony at
issue made no reference to the truthfulness or good character of the
complainant, or of themselves.  Their evidence was rather corroborative of an
issue in the trial that was raised in the complainant's testimony ‑‑
the system of violent domination that the appellant used to control the members
of the household.  While the impugned testimony shored up the complainant's
credibility by implication, it was not called solely or even primarily for that
purpose.  It was not, therefore, oath‑helping evidence.

 

                   Evidence which
tends to show bad character or a criminal disposition on the part of the
accused is admissible if (1) relevant to some other issue beyond
disposition or character, and (2) the probative value outweighs the
prejudicial effect.  The impugned evidence tended to show that the appellant is
a person of bad character, with a propensity for violence.  It was, however,
not tendered solely to show that the appellant was the sort of person likely to
commit the offences charged.  Rather, it was to rebut the defence of innocent
association and demonstrate the system of violent control that the appellant
exercised over the family.  This would explain why the abuse was allowed to
occur and why the complainant was too frightened to press charges until much
later.  It also countered the suggestion that the complainant's mother was
responsible for her physical injuries.

 

                   Where the evidence
sought to be adduced by the prosecution concerns a morally repugnant act
committed by the accused, the potential prejudice is great and the probative
value must be high to permit its reception.  The evidence was clearly probative
and its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect.

 

                   Trial judges must
properly instruct juries as to the use that they can make of evidence which is
highly prejudicial to an accused in relation to the accused's character.  Here,
the trial judge did not charge the jury with respect to the use they could make
of this testimony.  The judge was required to explain clearly in the
instructions to the jurors that they must not infer from the evidence that
tended to show the appellant's bad character that the appellant was guilty because
he is the sort of person who is likely to commit the offences in question.  The
prejudicial effect of the impugned testimony was high enough that lack of
proper instruction may have resulted in unfair guilty verdicts.  The trial
judge's caution to the jury that they could not use a conviction on one count
before them as evidence of propensity to commit the other counts and that they
could only make limited use of the evidence of the appellant's prior
convictions did not cure the charge of its faults.  Finally, no connection
exists between the degree of relevancy of the evidence and the need for
instructions as to the use that could be made of the testimony since highly
relevant evidence could still be extremely prejudicial to the accused and be
misused by the jury in reaching their verdict.

 

                   Section 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  should not have been invoked here.  The evidence
was not so overwhelming that the jury would have inevitably convicted the
appellant if the judge had properly instructed them as to the use they could
make of that testimony.  Credibility was a large issue at trial, and it is
impossible to know what was in the minds of the jurors and how they were
affected by the unrestricted admission of the evidence in question.  The
assessment of whether to apply the curative provision is complicated by the
fact that there were multiple charges which involved included offences, with
the result that a properly instructed jury might have convicted but not on all
the charges or for different offences.  

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.: 
The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered for the reasons given by
Iacobucci J.  The evidence of complainant's brothers was admissible but the
absence of instruction from the trial judge as to the limited purpose for which
the evidence could be used required a new trial.  This was not a case for the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  In
order to decide that, notwithstanding the judgment of the trial court could be
set aside on the basis of a wrong decision on a question of law, there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the appellate court must be
satisfied by the Crown that the verdict at trial would necessarily have been
the same if the error had not been committed.

 

                   In deciding whether
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) should be applied, it must be asked if the guilty
verdict, had the jury been properly instructed, would necessarily have been the
same in the sense that any other verdict would have been  unreasonable or not
supported by the evidence.  This exercise must be conducted with respect for
the jury's function.  It is generally undesirable to speculate as to the basis
upon which a jury might or might not have accepted certain evidence and
rejected other evidence.

 

                   The absence of the
appropriate direction concerning the evidence of complainant's brothers cannot
be safely assumed to have had no material effect on the deliberations of the
jury.  There was no instruction, as required by law, that this evidence not be relied
upon as proof that the accused is the sort of person who would commit the
offence charged and on that basis infer that the accused is in fact guilty. 
Indeed, there was an invitation to do exactly what the jury ought to have been
clearly told not to do.  Three possible effects of such evidence upon the jury
are:  (1) the jury may convict based on propensity; (2) the jury
might convict to punish for past acts; and (3) the jury might become
confused and substitute a verdict with respect to the past acts for a verdict
on the charges in issue.  The jury's verdict would not necessarily have been
the same had the trial been conducted in accordance with the law.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé J.
(dissenting):  The impugned evidence was relevant and, as its
probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect, was properly admissible. 
The failure of a trial judge to instruct a jury adequately concerning the use
that can be made of evidence which tends to show bad character may constitute
an error of law.  The charge should be considered in its entirety and be
examined in the light of what was effectively conveyed to the jurors.  In this
case, the jury was adequately instructed concerning the applicable principles. 

 

                   A court is entitled
to consider the strategy of the parties in determining whether or not there was
an error in the instructions to the jury.  Here, defence counsel made an active
tactical decision not to object to the evidence of one brother, or the
instructions, but deliberately used the evidence in a strategy designed to
illustrate that the allegations were so heinous as to be improbable.  

 

                   Under s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , a court must ask whether a properly instructed and
reasonably acting jury would have necessarily arrived at the same conclusion,
and may affirm the conviction given an affirmative answer.  In determining
whether there has been a miscarriage of justice, a court must examine the case
in its totality.  Here, the evidence was overwhelming, and no jury, properly
instructed and acting reasonably, could possibly have acquitted the accused. 
The result of a re-trial would necessarily be the same and the accused cannot
be said to have been deprived of his right to a fair trial.  This Court can
appropriately apply the curative provisions of the Code.

 

                   Per Gonthier J.
(dissenting):  The evidence was admissible for the reasons stated by
Iacobucci and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ.  The reasons of L'Heureux‑Dubé
J. with respect to the adequacy of the charge and the application of the Code's
curative provisions were agreed with.  The trial judge's instructions were
adequate, having regard to the circumstances of this case, including the
defence counsel's full use of the evidence in support of the defence that the
allegations were so heinous that it was improbable that they would have
occurred or not have been reported.  Further, the evidence supporting the guilt
of the accused was overwhelming and s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  should be applied to remedy any defect.

                   The reasons of
Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J. were delivered by

 

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- I agree that this
appeal must be allowed and a new trial ordered for the reasons given by Justice
Iacobucci.  I agree that the evidence of L.L. and T.B. was admissible but that
the absence of instruction from the trial judge as to the limited purpose for
which the evidence could be used requires a new trial.

 

                   The key issue, in
my view, is whether this is a case for the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .  In my respectful opinion,
this is not a case for the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) for reasons
which I will briefly develop.

 

                   The principles
relating to s. 686(1) (b)(iii) have been clearly articulated by a series
of decisions of this Court.  The section reads as follows:

 

                   686. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction . . . the court of appeal

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                          (b) 
may dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred;

 

                   The law is clear
that in order to decide that, notwithstanding the judgment of the trial court
could be set aside on the basis of a wrong decision on a question of law, there
was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the appellate court must be
satisfied by the Crown that the verdict at trial would necessarily have been
the same if the error had not been committed (see, e.g. Colpitts v. The
Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 744, cited with approval by Lamer J. (as he
then was) for the Court in Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at
p. 328).

 

                   As Cartwright J.
noted in Colpitts, the discharge of  this burden by the Crown is a
condition precedent to the right of the appellate court to apply the terms of
the subsection, but the court is not bound to apply the subsection merely
because this onus is discharged.  Moreover, as he further pointed out, there is
a danger that if appellate courts resort too readily to the proviso, ""the
judges would in truth be substituted for the jury, the verdict would become
theirs and theirs alone, and would be arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence
without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing
the evidence with the assistance which this affords"" (see Cartwright J. in
Colpitts, supra, at p. 744).

 

                   Unless used with
great circumspection, the provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
would effectively deprive accused persons of the right to have their guilt or
innocence determined by a properly instructed jury of their peers.

 

                   In applying s.
686(1) (b)(iii), it is useful to consider it in combination with s.
686(1) (a)(i), which permits the appellate court to allow the appeal
""where it is of opinion that . . . the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence"".  The relationship between these two provisions was outlined by
McIntyre J. for the Court in R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168.  In the
course of his reasons, on behalf of the Court, McIntyre J. referred to Mahoney
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, citing with approval a statement from my
judgment therein to the effect that before an appellate court can rely on what
is now s. 686(1) (b)(iii), the Court must ""first make a finding that
no jury properly charged could reasonably acquit"" (see McIntyre J. in R.
v. Yebes, at p. 182 and Lamer J. (as he then was) in Mahoney v. The
Queen, at pp. 857-58).  More recently this Court in R. v. S. (P.L.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, Sopinka J. said at p. 916:

 

                   On
the other hand, if the Court of Appeal finds an error of law with the result
that the accused has not had a trial in which the legal rules have been
observed, then the accused is entitled to an acquittal or a new trial in
accordance with the law.  The latter result will obtain if there is legally
admissible evidence on which a conviction could reasonably be based.  The court
cannot substitute its opinion for that of the trial court that the evidence
proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the accused is entitled to that
decision from a trial judge or jury who have all the advantages that have been
so often conceded to belong to the trier of fact.  If the Court of Appeal were
to make that decision the accused would be deprived of a trial to which he or
she is entitled, first, by reason of the abortive initial trial and second by
the Court of Appeal.  There is, however, an exception to this rule in a case in
which the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably
convict.  In such circumstances, depriving the accused of a proper trial is
justified on the ground that the deprivation is minimal when the invariable
result would be another conviction.  These limitations on the powers of the Court
of Appeal are the result of the combined effect of s. 686(1) (a)(ii), (b)(ii)
and (iii) and s. 686(2).  By virtue of s. 686(1) (b)(ii) the Court of
Appeal cannot dismiss the appeal if it has found an error of law unless the
curative provision embodied in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) applies.  If the appeal
is not dismissed it must be allowed, and pursuant to the provisions of s.
686(2) either an acquittal or a new trial must be ordered.

 

                   I therefore
approach the question of whether this is a case in which the proviso of s.
686(1) (b)(iii) should be applied by asking whether, if the jury had been
properly instructed, the verdict of guilty would necessarily have been the same
in the sense that any other verdict would have been  unreasonable or not
supported by the evidence.  This exercise must be conducted with respect for
the function of the jury, whose role it is to determine what evidence of which
witnesses they accept, the weight it should be accorded and, in the final
analysis, whether there exists a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the
accused.

 

                   In approaching the
question in this case, it is essential to bear in mind that, in the final
analysis, the case turned on questions of credibility.  Depending on what
evidence was accepted, there certainly could have been ample evidence upon
which a jury properly instructed could convict on the charges upon which this
jury convicted the accused.  However, verdicts of acquittal on all counts on
the trial record as it stands would, in my respectful view, not be susceptible to
be set aside as being unreasonable.

 

                   It is generally
undesirable to speculate as to the basis upon which a jury might or might not
have accepted certain evidence and rejected other evidence.   This is all the
more true when there is to be a new trial.   Without in any way suggesting that
a jury failed, or in fact should have failed, to accept any or all of the Crown
evidence in this case, their decision to do so would not have been unreasonable
in the circumstances of this case.  The allegations were very old because there
had been a long delay in bringing the allegations to the attention of the
police.  The accused testified in answer to the charges and denied everything. 
The deliberations of the jury were not short.  The jury retired just after
12:00 noon, and returned just after 5:00 p.m. that afternoon with a request to
re-hear certain parts of the evidence.  A verdict was not returned until 10:40
a.m. the following morning.  The jury acquitted on the charge of procuring a
miscarriage, although there was evidence from the complainant relating to that
charge.  None of these considerations, of course, is in any way conclusive, but
they underline the dangers inherent in speculating as to what may have been in
the jury's mind as it reached its verdicts.  Everything depends on what
evidence was accepted and what evidence was not accepted in the face of a sworn
denial of all charges from the accused in the witness box.

 

                   I then turn to the
question of whether the absence of the appropriate direction concerning the
evidence of T.B. and L.L. can be safely assumed to have had no material effect
on the deliberations of the jury.  With respect to those of a contrary view, I
am quite unable to reach any such conclusion in all of the circumstances of
this case.  As Iacobucci J. properly says, the evidence of L.L. and T.B. tends
to show that the appellant is a person of bad character with a propensity for
violence.  I agree with Iacobucci J. and Justice L'Heureux-Dubé that,
notwithstanding this possible prejudicial effect, the evidence in the
circumstances of this case was nonetheless admissible because it was relevant
to several serious issues in the case such as the defence of innocent
association, the system of violent control that the appellant exercised over
the family, and the suggestion that Mrs. L. was responsible for the
complainant's physical injuries.  However, the potential of the prejudicial
effect of this evidence cannot be ignored.

 

                   There was no
instruction, as in my opinion the law requires, that this evidence not be
relied upon as proof that the accused is the sort of person who would commit
the offence charged and on that basis infer that the accused is in fact guilty
(see R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, at p. 128).

 

                   As Sopinka J.
pointed out in R. v. D. (L.E.), there are three possible effects of such
evidence upon the jury:  first, the jury may convict based on propensity;
second, the jury might convict to punish for past acts; and third, the jury
might become confused and substitute a verdict with respect to the past acts
for a verdict on the charges in issue.  The evidence of T.B. and L.L. raised
serious dangers that these improper and unjust effects might flow.  Consider
how the theory of the Crown was put to the jury by the trial judge:

 

 

                   Mr.
[F.F.B.]'s evidence was evasive and contradictory on numerous occasions.  No
independent character witnesses were called and significantly his sons were not
called to testify.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   It
is inconceivable that so many of the children would come forward with their
evidence of cruel games, physical abuse, sexual abuse, if it did not happen. 
The defendant has denied it all.

 

                    
It is clear from the children's evidence that each one of them had different
memories of those years in [T.].  However, the constant theme in their
evidence is cruel games, physical, mental and sexual abuse and control,
exercised by Mr. [F.F.B.]. [Emphasis added.]

 

                   The theory of the
Crown as put to the jury by the trial judge was an invitation to the jury to
infer F.F.B.'s guilt of the counts in the indictment on the basis that he was a
person with the propensity for cruelty and violence to children.  In short, it
was an invitation to the jury to do exactly what the law prohibits.  Not only
was there no instruction that this should not be done, as in my view the law
requires; there was, in fact, an invitation to do exactly what the jury ought
to have been told, in the clearest possible terms, not to do. 

 

                   In these circumstances,
it can scarcely be concluded that the verdict of the jury would have been the
same had the trial been conducted in accordance with the law.  Upon the
evidence adduced, a verdict of guilty was justified, but not inevitable.  A
verdict of acquittal would not have been unreasonable.  The absence of the
required instruction, in the circumstances of this case and in light of the way
the theory of the Crown was put to the jury was a serious error cutting to the
heart of the manner in which the jury should approach the evidence.  A clearer
case for a new trial is difficult to imagine.  The application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
is completely inappropriate.

 

                   I therefore cannot
agree with my colleague L'Heureux-Dubé J. concerning the application of s.
686(1) (b)(iii) in this case. 

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé J.'s
reasons, in my respectful opinion, fall into error with respect to the dangers
of prejudice created by the sort of evidence here in issue.  She says at p.
000:

 

The
totality of evidence in this case produces a strong sense of moral revulsion,
and it would not be surprising if the jury were to conclude that the appellant
was in fact a bad person.  Such a conclusion does not, in itself, create a
problem.  The problem arises where a jury uses this conclusion to make the
further conclusion, in the absence of evidence of guilt, that the
accused is guilty because he is the type to do such atrocious acts.  [Emphasis
in original.]

 

                   With respect, this
is not the law.  It is precisely the very chain of reasoning against which the
jury is to be cautioned; they are not to be told to go ahead and use evidence
of propensity as evidence of guilt provided there is other evidence, as
my colleague implies in the quoted passage.  They should be told, but were not
here, to put that chain of reasoning out of their minds.

 

                   In order to reach
the conclusion that the evidence of the Crown is ""compelling"" and its
weight ""staggering"" my colleague must assume that Crown witnesses are
credible and that the evidence of the defence is not.  This conclusion appears
to be premised on the fact that ""the complainant and her family have
already lived through an experience of unspeakable violence"" (at p.
000, emphasis added).  These are matters which the law, justice and the public
interest require to be entrusted to a properly instructed jury.

 

                   I would allow the
appeal and order a new trial.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

//L'Heureux-Dubé J.//

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Iacobucci, and agree
with his conclusion that the evidence of L.L. and T.B. was admissible.  In my
opinion, the testimony was relevant and was therefore properly admissible
subject to a weighing of the probative value against any prejudicial effect. 
Both the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal agreed on this
point.  In this regard, I agree with Hallett J.A. of the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal who said (1991), 107 N.S.R. (2d) 231, at pp. 255-56:

 

                   In
my opinion, (L.L.'s) evidence, which was set out in some considerable detail in
the decisions of Justices Jones and Chipman, was admissible not as similar fact
evidence but simply because it was relevant and highly probative to explain to
the jury how these assaults on (P.A.L.) could have occurred and continued over
so many years in this crowded household and nothing was ever said.  The
evidence disclosed that Mr. (L.) was rarely home and Mrs. (L.) was generally at
work which left the appellant in charge of these young children.  Without the
evidence of his cruelty to these captive children and the total domination of
them as a result of their fear of him, there is no explanation of why none of
the children, including (P.A.L.), ever spoke of what was taking place.  It is
relevant and probative because without it this horror story, cloaked in secrecy
for some 25 years, would not seem credible.

 

                   (L.L.'s)
evidence was admissible to show the circumstances that existed in the household
during the years these assaults on (P.A.L.) took place.  I would prefer not to
cloak the evidence with the questionable mantle and trappings of ""similar
fact"" evidence to support its admissibility.  (L.L.'s) evidence of the
appellant's cruelty, although it certainly proves the appellant's disposition
to violence and is prejudicial, was, in the peculiar circumstances of this
case, admissible for the reason I have stated.

 

                   The
appellant was certainly entitled to a fair trial and to have excluded evidence
adduced solely to show bad disposition.  However, (L.L.'s) evidence was not
introduced for that sole purpose.  The law does not immunize the appellant from
having relevant evidence adduced by the Crown to show the circumstances and
setting in which the assaults on (P.A.L.) were alleged to have taken place.

 

                   The only remaining
issue, as my colleague asserts, is whether the trial judge made an error in law
in instructing the jury as to the use that could be made of this evidence.  If
the charge is adequate in that respect, that is the end of the matter.  If not,
should the curative provision of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , apply?

 

Did the Trial Judge Err in Instructing
the Jury?

 

                   The failure of a
trial judge to instruct a jury adequately may constitute an error of law.  In
determining whether or not a charge is inadequate, there are some preliminary
considerations that must be kept in mind.

 

                   First, one must
remain cognizant of Dickson J.'s (as he then was) observation in Vézeau v.
The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at p. 285:

 

                   A
jury charge should not be anatomized, cut in pieces and examined part by part,
as though it were a plant or animal in a laboratory experiment.

 

Lamer J. (now Chief Justice) confirmed
in Young v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 39, at p. 45, a judge's
charge ""should be considered in its entirety and be examined in the light
of what was effectively conveyed to the jurors."" (See also R. v.
Demeter (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 436).

 

                   Second, in
examining the charge and its possible effect on the jury, the court is entitled
to assume that juries are both reasonable and intelligent.  In this regard, I
would repeat the words of Dickson C.J. in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
670, at p. 692:

 

                   In
my view, it would be quite wrong to make too much of the risk that the jury might
use the evidence for an improper purpose.  This line of thinking could seriously
undermine the entire jury system.  The very strength of the jury is that the
ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary
citizens who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process a
healthy measure of common sense.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

                   In light of these
remarks, I refer to the relevant portion of the charge to the jury.  The trial
judge commented as follows:

 

                   It
is a fundamental principle of criminal law that the evidence as to one count in
the indictment cannot be used to prove the guilt of an accused person on
another count.  For example, an accused may be charged in one count with the
offence of theft and in another count with the offence of assault.  Both
incidents may have occurred at different times or involve different victims. 
In that situation, it would be wrong to use the evidence relating to the
offence of theft in  determining whether the accused was guilty of assault. . . .

 

                   In
the present case, [F.F.B.] is charged with six counts covering four different
offences.  There are two counts of each of two of those offences and two counts
of other offences.  When considering the evidence, do not use the evidence as
to one count to try to prove guilt on another count.  And when examining the
evidence as to one count, you should not conclude that Mr. [F.F.B.] is a
person whose character or disposition is such that he likely committed the
offence described in any of the other counts of the indictment.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

                   Reading the charge
as a whole, I cannot conclude that the jury was inadequately instructed
concerning the applicable principles, nor that they were incapable of
understanding the instructions given them.  The trial judge instructed the jury
that evidence of one offence could not be used to prove another offence, and
that the evidence should not be used to draw conclusions about F.F.B.'s
character or disposition.  I believe it is noteworthy that the jury did not
find the accused guilty of all six charges on the Bill of Indictment, but
rather acquitted the accused of the charge related to procuring a miscarriage
(s. 237(1)  of the Criminal Code ).  If the jury had found the
accused guilty on all charges, I would not necessarily conclude that the jury
had used the evidence of L.L. improperly.  However, the fact that the jury did
not convict on all grounds supports the conclusion that the jury understood the
principles of law, that they properly followed the instructions of the trial
judge, and that they found the accused guilty of specific charges based solely
on the evidence before them.

 

                   Although the instructions
could have been more explicit, in the totality of the circumstances of this
case, the directions given were adequate.  One such circumstance of particular
importance was the defence counsel's own use of the evidence in question.

 

Tactics of Defence Counsel

 

                   Defence counsel did
not object to L.L.'s evidence, nor to the instructions given to the jury.  The
trial judge provided an opportunity for counsel to voice any objections to both
evidence and instructions.  Though defence counsel did in fact raise several
objections throughout the trial, he specifically did not raise objections
concerning L.L.'s evidence or the related portion of the instructions to the
jury.

 

                   I am not suggesting
that failure to object at trial will preclude counsel from alleging on appeal
that an error was made.  Mere silence of counsel cannot displace the right of
an accused to a fair trial.  However, it is important to consider the reasons
for counsel's failure to raise any objection to L.L.'s evidence.  In this
regard, the comments of Arnup J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Guenot, Kocsis and Lukacs (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 315, at p. 320, are
apposite:

 

                   No
slip or mistake of counsel should be permitted to bring about a miscarriage of
justice, but on the other hand in considering the weight of the position taken
in this Court with respect to an alleged omission on the part of the trial
Judge of the kind mentioned we think we are quite entitled to take into
consideration the position which was deliberately and forcefully taken by
counsel for that appellant at the trial.

 

                   Counsel for the
defence not only failed to object to the evidence of L.L., but also used
it to illustrate that the allegations were so heinous as to be improbable.  In
the closing address to the jury, counsel specifically referred to this
evidence, and stated that ""the accusations against [F.F.B.] have to be
viewed in the light of all of these circumstances"".  Counsel went on to
say:

 

It's
almost as if the Crown witnesses would want you to believe . . . that
for ten years of Mr. [F.F.B.]'s 55 years of life, he was some sort of man who
took on subhuman proportions and I suggest to you that that's highly unlikely.

 

                   The failure to
object was neither accidental or inadvertent.  Counsel was not simply caught
off guard, but had a specific strategy.  This is clear in comments made by
defence counsel to the Justices of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, as cited in
the reasons for judgment of Chipman J.A., at p. 250:

 

But,
you know, it's one of those things when you're doing the trial, sometimes the
more absurd it sounds, I mean, we were in a difficult situation. We had --

 

Justice
Jones:  No question
about that.

 

Mr.
Coady:  -‑ a
complainant and we had corroboration.

 

Justice
Hallett:  Yes, (T.),
(D.).

 

Mr.
Coady:  (T.).  In my
mind, the evidence of (T.B.), was, it carried the day.  I think his evidence
was very very important.  He was one of the best witnesses that the Crown could
ever hope to have and that . . . so it became a situation where, to
some degree, the more bizarre, the more heinous and the more absurd that the
allegations in totality were, probably the greater it fed any possible hope
that we had for reasonable doubt and they were given great rein by not
objecting and they were cross‑examined at length about it and it was
focused on.

 

Now,
that obviously it wasn't sufficient to erode the conclusion of the Jury, but I
just leave it with you.  It's one of those things, it's a judgment call you
make during the trial when you're in a tough situation.

 

Justice
Hallett:  At that
point in time, you felt that (F.F.B.) was in great jeopardy of being found
guilty, even before (L.L.) was called.

 

Mr.
Coady:  No question
about that.

 

                   Counsel was of the
opinion that the evidence of T.B. ""carried the day"", and attempted to
make strategic use of the evidence of L.L. to raise a reasonable doubt.  The
Court is entitled to consider this strategy in determining whether or not there
was an error in the instructions to the jury.  Given that the failure to object
was strategic, that counsel was given a full opportunity to object or to make
suggestions as to the instructions, and the wording of the judge's address to
the jury which I outlined earlier, I conclude that the instructions to the jury
were adequate.

 

                   However, even if I
were wrong in my conclusion as to the adequacy of the instructions, I would
without hesitation apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
to remedy any defect.

 

Section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code 

 

                   The curative
provision of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

 

                   686. (1)  On the hearing of an
appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit,
on account of insanity, to stand trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b)  may
dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(iii)  notwithstanding
that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred; [Emphasis
added.] 

 

                   There is no dispute
as to the relevant test under this section.  The test was set out by this Court
in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, at p. 756.  Here,
Spence J. stated the rule as follows:

 

If
there is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly charged, would
have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then this Court should
not apply the provisions of [s. 686(1) (b)(iii)] to affirm a
conviction.

 

Cartwright J. clarified the burden
involved at p. 744:

 

. .
. once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus
resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.

 

                   The Court must ask
whether a properly instructed and reasonably acting jury would have necessarily
arrived at the same conclusion.  If this question can be answered in the
affirmative, then there has been no substantial wrong, no miscarriage of
justice, and the Court may affirm the conviction.  To decide whether there has
been a miscarriage of justice, the Court must examine the case in its
totality.  As McIntyre J. stated in Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
233, at p. 240: 

 

It
is not every error which will result in a miscarriage of justice, the very
existence of the proviso to relieve against errors of law which do not cause a
miscarriage of justice recognizes that fact.

 

                   It is thus critical
to consider all the evidence that was available to the jury.  There was, of
course, the evidence of P.A.L.  She told a nightmarish story of physical and
sexual abuse.  She spoke of sexual molestation as a child, of forcible rape at
10 years of age, and of being rushed to the hospital because of the resulting
haemorrhaging.  She told of the appellant grinding her face into the ground
with his foot, holding her head under the water in a bathtub and threatening to
bury her with her dead brother, cutting her legs with knives, burning her with
cigarettes and cigarette lighters.  She told of having a broken bottle stabbed
into her leg, and silence and compliance obtained through threats to burn down
the house and kill her family, of giving birth twice before the age of 16.

 

                   This disturbing
evidence was supported by other witnesses.  T.B. saw the accused have
intercourse with P.A.L. when she was 16.  D.M.L. confirmed seeing the accused
smash P.A.L.'s face into the side of a car.  She also was a witness to years of
sexual abuse:

 

                   A. 
. . . I remember seeing on occasions, [F.F.B..] come in our bedroom
and have intercourse with [P.A.L.].  I remember [P.A.L.] saying no, no.  He
never said an awful lot.  He just did as he felt like.  I did pretend I was
asleep at the time.  I didn't . . . I was only young too.  I never
told [P.A.L.] until later on in the years that I did know this, because I felt
. . .  I couldn't say anything to my mother about it, in fear and I
felt too, that I was . . .  I felt bad because I couldn't say
anything.  I felt that I was doing [P.A.L.] an injustice at the time, because I
didn't want it happening to me.  So, I pretended I was snoring and not seeing
anything, it wouldn't happen to me.

 

                   Q.   You
mentioned you were young.  How old were you when you . . .  When you
remember this, how old do you feel you were?

 

                   A.   I
was around ten, eleven.

 

                   Q.   Can
you remember how often it happened?

 

                   A.   It
happened, well it happened quite often, but I wasn't always awake either, I
wouldn't think, but it happened quite often.  I mentally in my head, tried to
block it out, but I found it hard sleeping at night, knowing what was going on.

 

                   Q.   Do
you know how long it continued?

 

                   A.   It
continued right up until he left.

 

                   There was the
evidence from Mrs. L. which corroborated elements of both P.A.L.'s and T.B.'s
testimony.  Mrs. L. also told of breaking the lock on a cabinet belonging to
the accused, and finding items which belonged to P.A.L. but which had gone
missing.  There was evidence of P.A.L.'s two pregnancies, and hospital records
verifying the internal injuries sustained by P.A.L. when she, according to the
accused, fell on a stick.  There were remaining scars on her body which
provided additional evidence of physical abuse.

 

                   It is in the
context of all this evidence, that we must consider the evidence of L.L.  He
gave evidence of being beaten, hung from the bannister by a rope, deprived of
food, burned with cigarettes, locked outside in the winter wearing only shorts,
tied up and locked in a small dark room, made to stand naked in the corner, of
violent games played with knives and hammers.  It should be noted that this
evidence, as outrageous and unbelievable as it seems, was supported by the
evidence of the other witnesses.  T.B. testified that the accused had burned the
children with cigarettes, and carved his initials into the children's hands
with razor blades.  D.M.L. told of the violent games with knives and straps, of
children locked in dark rooms, of standing naked in the corner.  She told of
the accused's threatening to kill her if she spoke of these things.  W.L. spoke
of the violent environment, of the control exerted over the children by the
appellant, of children hung on coat hooks by their belts, of scars on his arm
where the appellant had carved his initials.

 

                   This evidence did
not paint the appellant in an attractive light, but it was highly relevant to
help explain the atmosphere in which the offences against P.A.L. took place. 
The totality of evidence in this case produces a strong sense of moral
revulsion, and it would not be surprising if the jury were to conclude that the
appellant was in fact a bad person.  Such a conclusion does not, in itself,
create a problem.  The problem arises where a jury uses this conclusion to make
the further conclusion, in the absence of evidence of guilt, that the
accused is guilty because he is the type to do such atrocious acts.

 

                   It should be clear
from the above that this is not a case where the jury was required to make a
finding with a limited amount of evidence.  On the contrary, the evidence
presented against the accused was overwhelming.  Defence counsel had good
reason to fear that his client was in great jeopardy of being found guilty. 
Even had the evidence of L.L. been excluded completely, the remaining evidence
was so compelling as to necessitate that a jury, properly instructed and acting
reasonably, would return a finding of guilt.  There was no room here for any
doubt.

 

                   After considering
all the evidence presented, I can say unequivocally that no jury, properly instructed
and acting reasonably, could possibly have acquitted the accused.  As McIntyre
J. wrote in Mahoney v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834, at p. 855,
""[t]he errors alleged lose their significance in the face of this
inevitable conclusion.""  I would reiterate my observation in R. v.
Nygaard, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1074, that where the result of a re‑trial
will necessarily be the same, a new trial is not in the best interests of the
administration of justice.  No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred in this case.  The result of a re‑trial would necessarily be the
same, and it cannot be said that the accused has been deprived of his right to
a fair trial.  It is thus just and appropriate for this Court to apply the
curative provisions of the Code.

 

                   For these reasons,
I find myself startled that, after remarking, at p. 000, that ""the
evidence was not so overwhelming that the jury would have inevitably convicted
the appellant""; my colleague concludes, at p. 000, that ""this is not
an appropriate case to invoke the curative provision"".  Quite frankly, if
the curative provision cannot be applied here, I do not know where it can be
applied.  The weight of evidence in this case is staggering.  To refuse to
apply the provision in these circumstances is to render the curative provision
impotent and enfeeble the meaning of the word ""justice"".  This Court
must give substance to the term ""miscarriage of justice"".  Justice
requires that all fairness be accorded an accused, but where, as in this case,
the accused has in fact been treated with fairness, justice also requires a
consideration of the public interest.

 

                   The Court cannot be
blind to the ramifications of sending this matter back for re‑trial. 
Apart from the time and expense to the public purse in terms of courts,
prosecutors and defence lawyers, the complainant and her family have already
lived through an experience of unspeakable violence as well as the trauma of a
trial.  A new trial will require them to once again re‑live experiences
that should not be experienced even once.  Given that there was no miscarriage
of justice in the first trial, this would be more than
""regrettable"".  In the circumstances of this case, a new trial would
itself, in my view, be a miscarriage of justice, the very type of miscarriage
that the curative provision of the Code was meant to prevent.

 

                   Since writing these
reasons, I have had occasion to read those of the Chief Justice.  I agree with
his observation that the key issue before the Court is to determine whether or
not the curative provision should apply, and that the exercise (at p. 000)

 

must
be conducted with respect for the function of the jury, whose role it is to
determine what evidence of which witnesses they accept, the weight it should be
accorded and, in the final analysis, whether there exists a reasonable doubt
about the guilt of the accused.

 

The law is well settled, as the Chief
Justice notes, at p. 000, that determinations as to credibility of witnesses,
and the weight to be given to the evidence ""are matters which the law,
justice and the public interest require to be entrusted to a properly
instructed jury.""  My reasons do not depart from these principles.  

 

                   I totally disagree
with the Chief Justice that the case essentially turns on credibility.  In most
if not all cases, a jury must make determinations on credibility, but there is
nothing here to suggest that credibility was more or less of an issue than in
any other case.  The issue before us is not one of credibility, but is rather
of weighing the evidence in its totality.

 

                   With respect, I
believe that the Chief Justice misinterprets my comments concerning the morally
repugnant nature of the evidence in this case.  The law is clear that a jury
should be instructed not to use evidence of propensity as evidence of guilt. 
However, my comments do not concern the instructions to be given by a trial
judge to a jury, but rather, the task facing an appellate court.  This task is
not to consider what the jury may or may not have thought, but to examine whether
the entire body of evidence before the jury was such that the court can be
satisfied that a properly instructed and reasonably acting jury would reach the
same conclusion.  The presence of such evidence is thus crucial to a
determination that the curative provision can be properly applied.  In my view,
the evidence before the Court in the present case is such that the curative
provision should apply.

 

                   In the result, I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

 

                   The judgment of
Iacobucci and Sopinka JJ. was delivered by

 

//Iacobucci J.//

 

                   Iacobucci
J. -- This appeal deals
primarily with two questions:  the rule of evidence which excludes evidence of
an accused's bad character, and the adequacy of the trial judge's charge to the
jury with respect to evidence that tends to show an accused's bad character.

 

I.  Facts

 

                   F.F.B., the
appellant, is the uncle of P.A.L., the complainant.  The appellant lived with
his sister E.L.'s family during the fifties and sixties in Nova Scotia.  Mr.
and Mrs. L. were rarely at home and F.F.B. was responsible for the care of
the L.'s twelve children.  P.A.L. testified that the appellant began abusing
her physically and sexually when she was six to eight years old and continued
to do so until she was sixteen, at which time the appellant left the L.
household.  P.A.L. testified that the sexual abuse began with kissing,
escalated to sexual touching and culminated in sexual intercourse when she was
ten years old.

 

                   The first incident
of sexual intercourse allegedly resulted in P.A.L.'s hospitalization for twelve
days with serious internal bleeding; she and the appellant both related at the
time that she had injured herself while playing on the bannister of the front
veranda.  P.A.L. testified that a month after her return from the hospital, the
appellant commenced to have sexual intercourse with her daily.  P.A.L. gave
birth to two sons at ages fifteen and sixteen, allegedly as a result of the
sexual abuse by the appellant.  Stories were apparently fabricated as to how
these pregnancies occurred.  P.A.L. was a shy person who had little contact
outside the home; she testified that the appellant used constant threats and
fear to enforce his will on her.

 

                   P.A.L. testified
that during this period she was also subject to repeated physical assaults. 
She testified to several specific incidents:  that the appellant once pushed
her to the ground and stepped on her face; that the appellant seriously cut her
leg with a broken milk bottle; that the appellant burned her with a cigarette
butt; and that the appellant forced her to consume a bottle of castor oil which
resulted in her miscarrying a child.  She stated that she bears numerous scars
which resulted from this abuse.  She also testified that the other children in
the household were physically abused and terrorized by the appellant.

 

                   In 1964, T.B., an
older brother of P.A.L., caught the appellant having sexual intercourse with
P.A.L.  As a result, the appellant was forced to leave the L.'s household.  In
1990, P.A.L. saw the appellant in a store.  She testified that she decided then
to report the alleged assaults to the police.  As a result of this report, the
appellant was charged with two counts of rape, three counts of assault, and one
count of procuring a miscarriage.  The appellant denied that any of the
incidents described by P.A.L. occurred.

 

                   During the course
of the trial, the judge decided on a voir dire not to admit the evidence
of D.M.L. (the complainant's sister) that she too had been sexually assaulted
by the appellant, on the ground that it fell within the similar fact evidence
rule and its prejudicial effect was not outweighed by its probative value. 
However, testimony of the complainant's brothers and sisters was admitted with
respect to the violent control that the appellant exerted within the
household.  The appellant was convicted by a jury on five of the six counts (he
was found not guilty of the charge of procuring miscarriage).  He was sentenced
to a total period of incarceration of 13 years.

 

                   The appellant
appealed his conviction to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal on two grounds which
were both dismissed.  At the conclusion of oral argument, the Court of Appeal
requested counsel to make further written submissions on two issues that had
been raised in oral argument.  One of these related to the admissibility of
evidence given by P.A.L.'s brother, L.L., and her step-brother, T.B.  The
appellant sought to have declared inadmissible those parts of L.L.'s and T.B.'s
testimony which related to assaults by the appellant on P.A.L.'s siblings.  The
appellant was not seeking to exclude the evidence of T.B. that he finally
discovered the appellant sexually assaulting P.A.L. and drove F.F.B. out of the
house.  The appellant's appeal on this ground was dismissed, Chipman and
Hallett JJ.A. concurring in separate reasons that the testimony of L.L. and
T.B. was admissible.  Jones J.A. dissented, holding that L.L.'s and T.B.'s
evidence was inadmissible since it was too prejudicial in relation to its
probative value, and because it did not come within the parameters of the
similar fact exception to the rule which excludes evidence of the accused's bad
character.  The appellant has appealed the judgment of the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal on this point to this Court as of right, under s. 691(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 .

 

II.  Relevant Legislation

 

Section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  reads:

 

                   686. (1)  On the hearing of an
appeal against a conviction . . . the court of appeal

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(b)  may
dismiss the appeal where

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(iii)  notwithstanding
that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

 

Section 691(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  reads:

 

                   691. (1)  A person who is
convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by the
court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a)  on
any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal
dissents. . . .

 

III.  Judgments of the
Courts Below

 

1.  Nova Scotia Supreme
Court, Trial Division

 

                   As mentioned above,
the appellant was convicted by a jury on five of the six counts and sentenced
to a total period of incarceration of 13 years.  Counsel for the appellant did
not object to L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony at trial and Nathanson J. did not
make any ruling concerning the admissibility of that testimony.  Neither did
Nathanson J. make any reference to the use to which the jury could put L.L.'s
and T.B.'s testimony in the charge to the jury.

 

2.  Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal (1991), 107 N.S.R. (2d) 231

 

                   L.L. did not give
any testimony which directly corroborated any of the specific allegations made
against the appellant by P.A.L.  His testimony, and much of T.B.'s, concerned
the abuse that they and the other siblings constantly suffered from the
appellant.  The appellant argued before the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that
this evidence was inadmissible because it tended to establish his bad character
and did not fall within the similar fact evidence exception to the rule which
excludes evidence of bad character.  The appellant also argued that, even if
the evidence was admissible, the jury should have been warned about the use to
which L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony could be put.  Two judges of the Court of
Appeal, Chipman and Hallett JJ.A., dismissed the appellant's appeal in separate
opinions.  One judge, Jones J.A., dissented and would have allowed the appeal.

 

                   (a)  Chipman
J.A.

 

                   Chipman J.A. was of
the opinion that the testimony of L.L. and T.B. was admissible as similar fact
evidence.  Chipman J.A. held that the test for admissibility of similar fact
evidence is that its probative value, in relation to a fact in issue other than
the accused's tendency to commit acts such as the offence charged, must
outweigh its prejudicial effect.  Since the appellant's counsel had not
objected to the admissibility of L.L.'s or T.B.'s testimony at trial, the trial
judge had not had the opportunity to evaluate explicitly the relevance of the
evidence in question and its prejudicial effect.  Chipman J.A. felt that it was
therefore appropriate for the Court of Appeal to undertake this evaluation. 
Chipman J.A. held on this issue that the evidence was highly probative in that
it established a pattern of dominant behaviour by the appellant which was
relevant both to the credibility of the evidence given by P.A.L. (which Chipman
J.A. described as ""almost incredible"") and to why she had waited so
long before making a complaint to the police.  Both P.A.L.'s credibility and
the long delay in coming forward were put in issue at trial by the appellant. 
Chipman J.A. also held at p. 251 that there was ""a degree of
distinctiveness, uniqueness and striking similarity between the evidence
relating to abuse of the siblings and the abuse which underlies the offences
charged against the appellant.""

 

                   As to the
prejudicial effect of the evidence, Chipman J.A. held that it was slight or
nonexistent in comparison to the probative value since the evidence put the
appellant in a bad light only incidentally.  The prejudicial effect of the
evidence was further reduced by its contemporaneity with the events narrated by
the complainant and by the fact that it did not bear the major burden of
proving the Crown's case.

 

                   Chipman J.A. held
that the evidence had such a high degree of relevance that a warning to the
jury not to use the evidence to convict on the basis of a tendency to commit
acts such as the offence charged, while desirable, was not necessary.  This
conclusion with respect to the substantial relevance of the evidence was
supported by the fact that the appellant's counsel did not object to it and did
not, when given the opportunity, ask the judge to make a further comment on
this evidence to the jury.

 

                   Finally, Chipman
J.A. held at p. 254 that the ""evidence pointing to the appellant's
guilt is such that I have no doubt but that had appropriate caution been given,
the result would necessarily have been the same; verdicts of guilty on the five
counts.  I would, if necessary, apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .""

 

                   (b)  Hallett
J.A.

 

                   Hallett J.A. agreed
with Chipman J.A.'s disposition of the appeal at p. 255, but would have found
the testimony of L.L. and T.B. admissible ""simply because it was relevant
and highly probative to explain to the jury how these assaults . . .
could have occurred and continued over so many years in this crowded household
and nothing was ever said.""  Hallett J.A. wrote at pp. 255-56:

 

The
evidence disclosed that Mr. (L.) was rarely home and Mrs. (L.) was generally at
work which left the appellant in charge of these young children.  Without the
evidence of his cruelty to these captive children and the total domination of
them as a result of their fear of him, there is no explanation of why none of
the children, including (P.A.L.), ever spoke of what was taking place.  It is
relevant and probative because without it this horror story, cloaked in secrecy
for some 25 years, would not seem credible.

 

Hallett J.A. held that the rule
excluding evidence of bad character did not apply since the evidence had not
been adduced solely to show that the appellant had a bad disposition.

 

                   (c)  Jones
J.A., dissenting

 

                   Jones J.A. would
have ordered a new trial on the grounds that the testimony of L.L. and T.B. was
improperly admitted.  Jones J.A. held that this evidence should have been
excluded on the ground that it was not similar fact evidence but simply
evidence of assaults on L.L.  Jones J.A. held that L.L.'s and much of T.B.'s
testimony had no relevance to the case and was highly prejudicial as showing
bad character.  Failure of counsel to object to the evidence did not relieve
the trial judge of a duty to exclude it.

 

                   Jones J.A. would
not have applied s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .  Jones
J.A. held that the evidence was highly inflammatory and might have affected the
minds of the jury adversely.  On the other hand, the evidence which was
properly admissible was not ""so overwhelming that the jury would have
convicted on all of the counts.""

 

IV.  Issues

 

There are four issues in this appeal:

 

1.  Did
the trial judge err in admitting the evidence given by L.L. and T.B. on the
ground that it was oath-helping evidence?

 

 

2.  Did
the trial judge err in admitting the evidence given by L.L. and T.B. on the
grounds that the evidence was irrelevant to any issue other than the
appellant's character or that its prejudicial value outweighed its probative
value?

 

3.  If
the evidence was admissible, did the trial judge err in not giving the jury
special instructions about the use they could make of L.L.'s and T.B.'s
testimony?

 

4.  Even
if the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence or in not properly charging
the jury, should the appeal be dismissed under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  on the ground that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred?

 

V.  Analysis

 

1.Did
the Trial Judge Err in Admitting the Evidence Given by L.L. and T.B. on the
Ground that it was Oath-helping Evidence?

 

                   As already
mentioned, this case was appealed to this Court as of right, under s. 691(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .  That section allows appeals ""on any question
of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents.""  Jones J.A., in
the Court of Appeal, dissented on the grounds that the testimony of L.L. and
much of the testimony of T.B. was inadmissible since it was not relevant to the
case and was highly prejudicial.  The question of whether or not the evidence
was inadmissible on the ground of being oath-helping evidence was not discussed
by the Court of Appeal, and therefore was not a ""question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissent[ed].""  Consequently, the appellant
cannot raise this as an issue before this Court.

 

                   In any event, there
is no merit to the appellant's submission.  The rule against oath-helping
prohibits a party from presenting evidence solely for the purpose of bolstering
a witness' credibility before that witness' credibility is attacked.  This type
of evidence is of the sort that would tend to prove the truthfulness of the
witness, rather than the truth of the witness' statements.  It includes
psychiatric evidence that the witness is likely to tell the truth in court
(see, e.g., R. v. Kyselka (1962), 133 C.C.C. 103 (Ont. C.A.)), evidence
of good character called solely to illustrate that a witness is likely telling
the truth (see, e.g., R. v. Clarke (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Alta.
C.A.)) and polygraph evidence (see, e.g., R. v. Béland, [1987] 2 S.C.R.
398).  The testimony of L.L. and T.B. made no reference to the truthfulness or
good character of the complainant, or of themselves.  Their evidence was rather
corroborative of an issue in the trial that was raised in P.A.L.'s testimony,
namely the system of violent domination that the appellant used to control the
members of the L. household.  While L.L.'s and T.B.'s evidence shored up
P.A.L.'s credibility by implication, it was not called solely or even primarily
for that purpose.  It was not, therefore, oath-helping evidence.

 

2.Did
the Trial Judge Err in Admitting the Evidence Given by L.L. and T.B. on the
Grounds that the Evidence was Irrelevant to any Issue other than the
Appellant's Character or that its Prejudicial Value Outweighed its Probative
Value?

 

                   The basic rule of
evidence in Canada is that all relevant evidence is admissible unless it is
barred by a specific exclusionary rule.  One such exclusionary rule is that
character evidence which shows only that the accused is the type of
person likely to have committed the offence in question is inadmissible.  As
Lamer J. (as he then was) wrote for this Court in Morris v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at pp. 201-02:

 

Thus
came about, as a primary rule of exclusion, the following:  disposition, i.e.,
the fact that the accused is the sort of person who would be likely to have
committed the offence, although relevant, is not admissible.  As a result
evidence adduced solely for the purpose of proving disposition is itself
inadmissible, or, to put it otherwise, evidence the sole relevancy of which to
the crime committed is through proof of disposition, is inadmissible.

 

However, evidence which tends to show
that the accused is a person of bad character but which is also relevant to a
given issue in the case does not fall within this exclusionary rule.  As Lamer
J. went on to write at p. 202:

 

                   This
is not to say that evidence which is relevant to a given issue in a case will of
necessity be excluded merely because it also tends to prove disposition.  Such
evidence will be admitted subject to the judge weighing its probative value to
that issue (e.g., identity), also weighing its prejudicial effect, and
then determining its admissibility by measuring one to the other.

 

                   Accordingly,
evidence which tends to show bad character or a criminal disposition on the
part of the accused is admissible if (1) relevant to some other issue beyond
disposition or character, and (2) the probative value outweighs the prejudicial
effect.

 

                   It is indisputable
that the evidence of L.L. and T.B. tends to show that the appellant is a person
of bad character, with a propensity for violence.  However, there are two
questions to be answered:  first, is their evidence relevant to some issue
other than the appellant's character, and second, does the probative value of
the evidence outweigh its prejudicial effect?

 

                   Was the testimony
of L.L. and T.B. relevant to some issue other than the appellant's character? 
The respondent argues, and both Chipman and Hallett JJ.A. held, that the
testimony of L.L. and T.B. was relevant to establishing a pattern of dominant
behaviour by the appellant which was relevant both to the credibility of the
evidence given by P.A.L. and to why she had waited so long before making a
complaint to the police.  Both P.A.L.'s credibility and her long delay in
coming forward were put in issue by the appellant.  The respondent also argues
that the appellant raised innocent association as a defence and that L.L.'s and
T.B.'s testimony was admissible to rebut that defence.  But the appellant
argues that his only defence was that he did not commit the offences with which
he was charged to which the evidence in question is irrelevant.

 

                   However, both the
opening and closing remarks to the jury by counsel for the appellant reveal
that the appellant did not assert solely that he did not commit the offences in
question.  Counsel for the appellant claimed that the appellant was simply a
benevolent baby-sitter who looked after the children as a favour to his sister,
raising the defence of innocent association.  In his closing remarks, counsel
for the appellant emphasized that the appellant ""did nothing more than
assist them [the L.s] in their times of need, when money was tight"". 
Counsel for the appellant also attempted to destroy the complainant's
credibility by questioning why she delayed so long in bringing charges, whether
her mind was stable given the atmosphere in which she grew up, and how the offences
charged by the complainant could have occurred without someone knowing or
saying something about it given the crowded conditions of the house.  For
example, counsel for the appellant addressed the jury as follows in his opening
remarks:

 

How
could all of this have happened without someone knowing about it, without
someone saying something about it and why is it being said now.

 

This theme was repeated during
counsel's closing remarks.  Counsel for the appellant also emphasized
throughout the trial that the complainant's mother was abusive towards her
children and might be the party actually responsible for the complainant's
physical injuries.

 

                   Given these various
theories raised by counsel for the appellant at trial, it is apparent that the
testimony of L.L. and T.B. was relevant to several important issues.  The
evidence was not tendered solely to show that the appellant was the sort of
person likely to commit the offences charged but to rebut the defence of
innocent association, to demonstrate the system of violent control that F.F.B.
exercised over the family which would explain why the abuse was allowed to
occur and why the complainant was too frightened to press charges until much
later, and to counter the suggestion that Mrs. L. was responsible for the
complainant's physical injuries.

 

                   The second question
to ask is:  does the probative value of L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony outweigh
its prejudicial effect?  As Chipman J.A. indicated in the Court of Appeal,
counsel for the appellant did not object to the evidence at trial and the trial
judge did not therefore make an explicit ruling on its admissibility.  Chipman
J.A. undertook to evaluate the evidence in the absence of an evaluation by the
trial judge, and determined that the probative value was high while the
prejudicial effect was low.  He therefore held that the evidence was
admissible.

 

                   Where the evidence
sought to be adduced by the prosecution concerns ""a morally repugnant act
committed by the accused, the potential prejudice is great and the probative
value of the evidence must be high indeed to permit its reception"" (per McLachlin
J. in R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 735).

 

                   With respect to the
evidence in question in this case, it is clearly probative of those aspects of
the case which the Crown wishes to prove in response to the issues raised by
counsel for the appellant.  The appellant's acts of physical violence related
by L.L. and T.B. and the fear that the appellant nourished in the children in
order to control them are similar to the account given by the complainant of
the physical abuse she suffered from the appellant and the terror she felt of
him.  The evidence given by L.L. and T.B. concerns events that were
contemporaneous with the offences charged by the complainant, and offers valid
explanations for many of the issues raised by the appellant at trial.  In my opinion,
although there is prejudice to the appellant involved, the probative value of
L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony outweighs its prejudicial effect and was properly
admitted by the trial judge as relevant evidence of which the probative value
is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.

 

3.If
the Evidence was Admissible, did the Trial Judge Err in Not Giving the Jury
Special Instructions about the Use They Could Make of L.L.'s and T.B.'s
Testimony?

 

                   It is an obligation
on trial judges that they properly instruct juries as to the use that those
juries can make of evidence which is highly prejudicial to an accused in
relation to the accused's character.  In the case at bar the trial judge did
not charge the jury with respect to the use they could make of L.L.'s and
T.B.'s testimony.  Given that the testimony might have a strong prejudicial
effect on the jury and that the jury might then convict on the basis that the
accused is a bad person of the sort likely to commit the offences in question,
clear directions to the jury about the use that they could make of the
testimony were essential.  More specifically, the judge was required to explain
clearly in the instructions to the jurors that they must not infer from the
evidence that tended to show the appellant's bad character that the appellant
was guilty because he is the sort of person who is likely to commit the
offences in question.

 

                   The respondent
argues that this type of instruction is a ""special"" instruction so
that the trial judge's failure to properly charge the jury in this respect is
not a reversible error of law.  However, in R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2
S.C.R. 111, this Court directed that a new trial be held where the trial judge
had not charged the jury properly with respect to the use they could make of evidence
admitted as an exception to the bad character evidence exclusionary rule. 
Sopinka J. wrote for the majority that the trial judge's instruction to the
jury is necessary to counteract three possible effects of the evidence on the
jury:  that the jury might convict based on propensity, that the jury might
convict to punish for past acts, and that the jury might become confused and
substitute a verdict with respect to the past acts for a verdict on the charges
in issue.  In light of the seriousness of these possible consequences, Sopinka
J. held at p. 128:

 

. .
. the trial judge should charge the jury in a manner that will minimize as far
as possible the dangers referred to above.  The jury should be instructed that
if it accepts the evidence of the similar acts, that evidence is relevant for
the limited purpose for which it was admitted.  The jury must be specifically
warned that it is not to rely on the evidence as proof that the accused is the
sort of person who would commit the offence charged and on that basis infer
that the accused is, in fact, guilty of the offence charged.

 

                   The concern is that
the evidence of bad character is potentially so inflammatory that without
proper instructions, a jury may misuse the evidence and an accused may thereby
be convicted unfairly.  This concern arises not only with similar fact evidence
but also with evidence that is of a highly prejudicial nature with respect to
the accused's character as in the case at bar.  Given that this Court ordered a
new trial in R. v. D. (L.E.), supra, partially on the ground that
the trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury with respect to the
limited use they could make of evidence tending to show the accused's bad
character, there is no support for the respondent's argument that lack of proper
instruction is not a reversible error of law and not ground for a new trial.

 

                   In the case at bar,
the trial judge admitted the testimony of L.L. and T.B. at large.  He did not
instruct the jury as to the use they could make of L.L.'s and T.B.'s testimony,
although he did caution the jury against using a conviction on one count as
evidence of propensity to commit the other counts.  The prejudicial effect of
that testimony was high enough that lack of proper instruction may have
resulted in unfair guilty verdicts.  There is no assurance that the jury
properly interpreted the evidence in question in the absence of specific
instructions by the trial judge.  On this ground, therefore, the appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   It should be noted that
Chipman J.A. considered the adequacy of the trial judge's charge to the jury. 
Chipman J.A. held that the trial judge had not commented on the limited use to
which the evidence could be put since counsel for the appellant had raised no
objection to the testimony and had not requested any special instructions. 
However, as Jones J.A. pointed out, it is the duty of the trial judge to
consider the admissibility of all evidence and to charge the jury properly: 
absence of comment or objection by counsel for the accused does not vitiate
this duty.

 

                   Chipman J.A.'s next
point was that the trial judge had cautioned the jury that they could not use a
conviction on one count before them as evidence of propensity to commit the
other counts and that they could only make limited use of the evidence of the
appellant's prior convictions.  In my opinion, however, this does not cure the
charge of its faults with respect to the testimony of L.L. and T.B. which,
owing to its prejudicial nature, should have been specifically addressed.

 

                   Finally, Chipman
J.A. held that the testimony in question had such a high degree of relevance
that a charge to the jury, while desirable, was not necessary.  With respect,
there is no connection between the degree of relevancy of the evidence and the
need for instructions as to the use that could be made of the testimony since
highly relevant evidence could still be extremely prejudicial to the accused
and be misused by the jury in reaching their verdict.

 

4.Even
if the Trial Judge Erred in Admitting the Evidence or in not Properly Charging
the Jury, Should the Appeal Be Dismissed under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code, on the Ground that No Substantial Wrong or Miscarriage of
Justice Has Occurred?

 

                   Chipman J.A. held
that, even if the evidence was improperly admitted or the jury was improperly
charged, he would apply s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code ,
to dismiss the appeal and leave the guilty verdicts intact.  He was of the
opinion, at p. 254, that the evidence pointing to the accused's guilt was
""such that I have no doubt but that had appropriate caution been given,
the result would necessarily have been the same; verdicts of guilty on the five
counts.""

 

                   Section 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , is for use in exceptional cases only, as this
Court has emphasized in two recent cases.  In R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1
S.C.R. 909, Sopinka J. held for the majority, at p. 916, that
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) can only be invoked where ""the evidence is
so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict"".  In R.
v. Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, the Court emphasized, at p. 620,
""[t]he appropriate standard for the application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
is an onerous one"".  The Court quoted Sopinka J.'s reasons from R. v.
S. (P.L.), supra, and stated at pp. 620-21:

 

                   Accordingly,
the question here is whether there is any possibility that the trier of fact
would have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused had the
impugned evidence been removed from their consideration.

 

                   The same question
may be asked in the context of whether the jury in the instant case could have
had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant's guilt had they been properly
charged with respect to how they might use the testimony of L.L. and T.B.  In
my opinion, the evidence was not so overwhelming that the jury would have
inevitably convicted the appellant if the judge had properly instructed them as
to the use they could make of that testimony.  Credibility was a large issue at
trial, and it is impossible to know what was in the minds of the jurors and how
they were affected by the unrestricted admission of the evidence in question. 
The assessment of whether to apply the curative provision of the Criminal
Code  is complicated by the fact that there were multiple charges which
involved included offences, with the result that a properly instructed jury
might have convicted but not on all the charges or for different offences.  In
summary, this is not an appropriate case to invoke the curative provision in s.
686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

 

VI.  Conclusion

 

                   The evidence of
L.L. and T.B. was admissible because it was relevant to several serious issues
in the case such as the defence of innocent association, the system of violent
control that the appellant exercised over the family which would explain why
the abuse was allowed to occur and why the complainant was too frightened to
press charges until much later, and the suggestion that Mrs. L. was responsible
for the complainant's physical injuries.  In my view, the probative value of
the testimony of L.L. and T.B. is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect and
the evidence was properly admitted.

 

                   Although the
evidence of L.L. and T.B. was properly admitted, the trial judge failed to
charge the jury as to the limited purposes for which the evidence could be
used.  This is grounds for a new trial, and I would allow the appeal and order
a new trial on this basis.

 

                   Finally, with
respect to the curative provision in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , given that the appropriate standard for applying s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
is an onerous one, namely whether or not the evidence properly before the jury
was so overwhelming that conviction was inevitable, I do not believe that this
is a case to which s. 686(1) (b)(iii) should be applied.

 

                   It should be stated
that it is highly regrettable that P.A.L. and her family, as well as the
appellant, will be forced to undergo a new trial.  However, we must be
inexorably vigilant to ensure that courts properly follow the rules which
provide fair trials to all those charged and tried under the Criminal Code .

 

                   Since writing these
reasons, I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of the Chief Justice; I
agree with them.

 

VII.  Disposition

 

                   For the foregoing
reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant,
and order a new trial.

 

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by 

 

//Gonthier J.//

 

                   Gonthier
J. (dissenting) -- I have
had the advantage of reading the reasons of my colleagues, Justices
L'Heureux-Dubé and Iacobucci.  I am in agreement with both of them that the
evidence of L.L. and T.B. were admissible for the reasons which they state.  I
agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J. that the trial judge's instructions were adequate,
having regard to the circumstances of this case which she outlines, including
the defence counsel's full use of the evidence in support of the defence that
the allegations were so heinous that it was improbable that they would have
occurred or not been reported.  I am also in agreement with L'Heureux-Dubé J.
that the evidence supporting the guilt of the accused is overwhelming and that
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , should be applied to remedy any defect.  

 

                   I would therefore
dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellant,
a flower vendor in Toronto, was charged with exposing goods for sale on the
street without a licence contrary to s. 11 of Metro By‑law 211‑74. 
Through By‑law 97‑80, Metro delegated to the city of Toronto the
authority to license the use of sidewalks.  Pursuant to this delegated
authority, Toronto By‑law 618‑80 allows an owner or occupant of
abutting land to apply for a licence to use the sidewalk.  Since appellant does
not own or occupy abutting land he could not apply for a licence.  He was also
charged with obstructing a peace officer contrary to s. 129  of the Criminal
Code  after he failed to obey the officer's instruction to pack up his
display and move on.  He was convicted of both offences.  The District Court
upheld the convictions.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, dismissed
the appellant's further appeal on both charges.  It concluded that the
regulatory distinction between street vendors and store vendors did not detract
from the scheme's validity because regulatory schemes, by their very nature,
are not intended to permit all persons to participate in the regulated
activity.  On the criminal charge, it found that the police officer had both
common law and statutory authority to enforce the by‑law, and that the
existence of other avenues of relief did not erode this authority.

 

                   Held:  The appeal
should be allowed.  The appellant's convictions on the by‑law and
criminal charges should be set aside and acquittals entered instead.

 

                   The
power to pass municipal by‑laws does not entail that of enacting
discriminatory provisions unless the enabling legislation authorizes such
discriminatory treatment.  Discrimination in the municipal law sense is no more
permissible between than within classes.  The general reasonableness or
rationality of the distinction is not at issue:  discrimination can only occur
where the enabling legislation specifically so provides or where the
discrimination is a necessary incident to exercising the power delegated by the
province.  Here, the distinctions between free‑standing street vendors
and owner/occupant vendors contained in Metro By‑law 97‑80 and City
of Toronto By‑law 618‑80 are not authorized by the Municipal Act
and these by‑laws are accordingly ultra vires the municipalities. 
For the reasons given in R. v. Greenbaum, s. 11 of Metro By‑law
211‑74 is also ultra vires the municipality.

 

                   In
charging the appellant with obstructing a peace officer, the officer in
question was attempting to enforce s. 11 of Metro By‑law 211‑74. 
Since that provision has been held to be ultra vires the municipality,
the appellant's conviction for obstructing a peace officer cannot stand. 
Further, even if s. 11 of Metro By‑law 211‑74 were valid, the
power to arrest in order to enforce the by‑law cannot be inferred in the
face of clear language in the Municipal Act and the Provincial
Offences Act setting out more moderate means of dealing with repeated
infractions.  The officer had no authority, either at common law or under
statute, to arrest the appellant for failing to comply with an order to desist
from conduct prohibited by the by‑law and could not circumvent the lack
of an arrest power by charging him with obstruction.

//Iacobucci J.//

 

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

                   Iacobucci
J. -- This
appeal raises two issues.  The first is the validity of municipal by-laws which
purport to license street vending under which the appellant was charged (the by-law
charge).  The second is whether the appellant should have been convicted on a
charge of wilfully disobeying the instructions of a police officer when the
police officer sought to enforce a municipal by-law, later found to be ultra
vires, by ordering the appellant to desist from conduct prohibited by the
by-law (the criminal charge).

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The
facts are basically quite simple.  On March 24, 1988, the appellant, Des Raj
Sharma, was employed as a flower vendor in the city of Toronto, Ontario.  He
was displaying his wares on Yonge Street near Dundas Street when he was
approached by Constable Coulis of the Metropolitan Toronto Police.  Constable
Coulis informed the appellant that exposing goods for sale on the street
without a licence violated s. 11 of Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto By-law
211-74.  The appellant was issued a Provincial Offences ticket and instructed
to pack up his display and move on.  Constable Coulis allowed the appellant a
brief grace period to check with his employer or lawyer if he was uncertain
about moving, but told him that if he was still there when the officer returned,
he would face criminal charges of obstructing the police.

 

                   The
appellant contacted his employer and was told that he was not to move.  The
appellant was still operating on the street upon Constable Coulis's return.
Accordingly, the appellant was charged with obstructing a peace officer
contrary to s. 129  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly
s. 118 ).  He was convicted of both offences under the by-law charge and the
criminal charge in Provincial Court.  His appeals to District Court were
dismissed.  A further appeal on both charges to the Ontario Court of Appeal,
heard in conjunction with an appeal in R. v. Greenbaum (reasons in which
are being released concurrently herewith), was also dismissed, Arbour J.A.
dissenting: (1991), 44 O.A.C. 355, 77 D.L.R. (4th) 334, 62 C.C.C. (3d) 147, 3
C.R. (4th) 195, 3 M.P.L.R. (2d) 1.  The matter comes to this Court by way of
leave, [1991] 1 S.C.R. xiv.

 

II.  Relevant
Statutory Authority

 

                   The
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (""Metro"") is a municipal
corporation governed by the provisions of the Municipality of Metropolitan
Toronto Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.62.  Within Metro, there are a number of
area municipalities, one of which is the city of Toronto.  Metro's powers are
exercised by its council by enacting by-laws.  Two of these by-laws purport to
confer upon area municipalities the power to license street vendors:  Metro
By-laws 211-74 and 97-80.  Sections 11 and 11a of Metro By-law 211-74 provide:

 

                   11.  No person shall, without
lawful authority, place or expose goods, wares or merchandise or articles of
any kind upon any metropolitan road allowance or hang or put up any goods,
wares or merchandise, or other articles outside of any building so that the
same shall project over any portion of a metropolitan road allowance.

 

                   11a (1)  The council of each of the
area municipalities set out in Schedule ""A"" to this By-Law is hereby
empowered to lease or license the use of sidewalks and untravelled portions of
Metropolitan roads within those portions of such area municipality in which
land may be used for commercial or industrial purposes, to the owners or
occupants of adjoining property for such purposes as the said council may by
lease or license permit, and for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions
as may be agreed. [Section 11a was added through Metro By-law 115-77.]

 

Schedule ""A"": the Borough of East York, the Borough of
Etobicoke, the Borough of North York, the Borough of Scarborough, and the
Borough of York

 

Section 11a(1) permits
scheduled area municipalities to grant licences to the owners or occupiers of
property which abuts Metropolitan roads.  The city of Toronto was removed from
Schedule ""A"" in March of 1978, with the result that s. 11a had no
application to the city of Toronto at the time the appellant was charged.

 

                   However,
through Metro By-law 97-80, Metro delegated to scheduled area municipalities
the authority to lease or license the use of sidewalks and untravelled portions
of Metropolitan roads.  The city of Toronto was included in Schedule
""A"" to this by-law.  Metro By-law 97-80 provides:

 

                   1. (1)  Notwithstanding the
provisions of By-law No. 211-74, as amended, the Council of each of the area
municipalities set out in Schedule ""A"" to this By-law is hereby
empowered to lease or license the use of sidewalks and untravelled portions of
Metropolitan roads within those portions of such area municipality in which
land may be used for commercial or industrial purposes to the owners in
possession or the occupants of adjoining properties for the purposes of:

 

(a)  display of merchandise;

(b)  operation of boulevard cafes;

(c)  installation of bicycle stands;

(d)  holding of sidewalk sales.

 

Schedule ""A"":  the city of Toronto, the city of North York

 

                   The
city of Toronto exercised its delegated power by enacting By-law 618-80. 
Section 1(1) of that By-law reads as follows:

 

1.(1)  An owner or occupant of land used for commercial or
industrial purposes which abuts on the sidewalk or untravelled portion of a
Metropolitan road within the City of Toronto may apply to the Commissioner of
Public Works and the Environment to lease or license the use of such sidewalk
and untravelled portion of the Metropolitan road within the City of Toronto for
the purposes of:

 

(a)  display of merchandise;

(b)  operation of boulevard cafes;

(c)  installation of bicycle stands;

(d)  holding of sidewalk sales.

 

The effect of By-law
618-80 is that only vendors who own or occupy abutting property can apply for
licences to sell on the street.

 

                   The
Court of Appeal held that the statutory basis for s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74
was to be found in ss. 314(1), para. 1 and 210, para. 140 of the Municipal
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 (formerly ss. 315, para. 1 and 210, para. 134):

 

                   314. -- (1)  The
councils of all municipalities may pass by-laws:

 

1. For prohibiting or regulating the obstructing, encumbering, injuring
or fouling of highways or bridges.

 

                   210.  By-laws may
be passed by the councils of local municipalities:

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   140.  For prohibiting and abating public
nuisances.

 

This appeal also raises
the issue of the applicability of s. 310 of the Municipal Act, which
states:

 

                   310.  By-laws may
be passed by the council of every local municipality,

 

                   (a)for leasing or licensing the use of untravelled
portions of highways under the jurisdiction of the council, except highways
that are extensions or connecting links of the King's Highway, to the owners or
occupants of adjoining property for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions
as may be agreed;

 

                   (b)for regulating and controlling the use, including
the use for parking purposes, of untravelled portions of highways under the
jurisdiction of the council that are not extensions or connecting links of the
King's Highway, which are leased or in respect of which a licence is granted under
clause (a).

 

                   The
appellant was also charged with the following Criminal Code  offence:

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 :

 

129.  Every one who

 

(a)  resists or wilfully obstructs a public officer or
peace officer in the execution of his duty or any person lawfully acting in aid
of such an officer,

 

                                                                    ...

 

is guilty of

 

(d)  an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or

 

(e)  an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

Other relevant
legislation includes the following:

 

Municipal Act, s. 327 (formerly s.
326):

 

                   327.  Where any
by-law of a municipality or of a local board thereof, passed under the
authority of this or any other general or special Act, is contravened and a
conviction entered, in addition to any other remedy and to any penalty imposed
by the by-law, the court in which the conviction has been entered, and any
court of competent jurisdiction thereafter, may make an order prohibiting the
continuation or repetition of the offence by the person convicted.

 

Police Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 381,
s. 57 [rep. 1990, c. 10, s. 148(1)]:

 

                   57.  The members of police forces
appointed under Part II, except assistants and civilian employees, are charged
with the duty of preserving the peace, preventing robberies and other crimes
and offences, including offences against the by-laws of the municipality, and
apprehending offenders, and commencing proceedings before the proper tribunal,
and prosecuting and aiding in the prosecuting of offenders, and have generally
all the powers and privileges and are liable to all the duties and
responsibilities that belong to constables.

 

Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33
(formerly R.S.O. 1980, c. 400):

 

                   3.--(1)  In addition to the procedure set
out in Part III for commencing a proceeding by laying an information, a
proceeding in respect of an offence may be commenced by filing a certificate of
offence alleging the offence in the office of the court.

 

                   (2)  A provincial offences officer who
believes that one or more persons have committed an offence may issue, by
completing and signing, a certificate of offence certifying that an offence has
been committed and,

 

(a)  an offence notice indicating the set fine for the
offence; or

 

(b)  a summons

 

in the form prescribed under section 13.

 

23. -- (1)  Any person who, on reasonable and
probable grounds, believes that one or more persons have committed an offence,
may lay an information in the prescribed form and under oath before a justice
alleging the offence and the justice shall receive the information.

 

Criminal Code , s. 495 :

 

                   495. (1)  A peace
officer may arrest without warrant

 

(a)  a person who has committed an indictable offence
or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit
an indictable offence;

 

(b)  a person whom he finds committing a criminal
offence;

 

III.  Judgments
in the Courts Below

 

1.  Provincial
Offences Court (By-law Charge)

 

                   Draper
Prov. Ct. J. dealt with two challenges raised by the defence to the validity 
of the by-law scheme.  The appellant submitted that Metro did not have
jurisdiction to control the sidewalks adjacent to Metro roads, because, based
on the wording of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. M.62 (formerly R.S.O. 1980, c. 314), the sidewalk running along
Yonge Street was not a Metropolitan road.  Judge Draper found that Yonge Street
had been legally designated a Metropolitan road in accordance with the Municipality
of Metropolitan Toronto Act.  After considering case law and pertinent
legislation, he concluded that the term ""road"" as used in the Municipality
of Metropolitan Toronto Act, was equivalent to the term ""road
allowance"" used in the by-law in question.  The term ""road
allowance"" was held to include the sidewalks in the Metro road system,
including Yonge Street where the by-law offence took place.

 

                   The
appellant also alleged that s. 11a of Metro By-law 211-74 violated s. 15(1)  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The appellant contended
that street vendors were subject to discrimination under the licensing regime
because, unlike owners and occupiers of adjoining property, they were not
eligible for leases or licences to expose goods for sale.  Judge Draper noted
that the municipality had an essential duty to preserve pedestrian access to
sidewalks.  He observed that s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74 was authorized by s.
210 of the Municipal Act and that the licensing regime provided Metro
with the means to restrict commercial use of sidewalks in order to meet this
primary obligation.  He concluded that the by-law did not single out the
appellant for discriminatory treatment and was, therefore, not in violation of
s. 15  of the Charter .  The appellant was convicted under s. 11 of Metro
By-law 211-74, fined $2,000, and ordered not to sell flowers on a specified
portion of Yonge Street for the two years of his probation.

 

2.  Provincial
Court (Criminal Division) (Criminal Charge)

 

                   In
dealing with the criminal charge, Paris Prov. Ct. J. found that the appellant
had been provided with notice that he risked criminal sanction if he remained
on the sidewalk in contravention of the constable's order to move on.  The fact
that the appellant had remained on the advice of his employer was not in itself
a defence but was a matter to be considered on sentencing.  The appellant was
convicted but granted a conditional discharge with one year's probation.

 

3.  District
Court of Ontario (1989), 7 W.C.B. (2d) 430 (By-law Charge)

 

                   On
appeal from the by-law infraction conviction, Lang Dist. Ct. J. found that
Metro By-law 211-74 was intra vires the regulatory power of Metro under
ss. 210, para. 73, 210, para. 140, and 314(1), para. 1 (formerly ss. 210,
para. 66, 210, para. 134, and 315, para. 1) of the Municipal Act. 
While declining to apply the similarly situated analysis employed by the trial
judge, she went on to reject the appellant's s. 15  Charter  argument. She
noted that any discrimination suffered by the appellant was not founded upon an
enumerated ground under s. 15(1) .  She also found that no evidence had been
adduced in support of the contention that street vendors formed a class of
persons subject to economic disadvantage such that they might be characterized
as an analogous group under s. 15 .  She dismissed the appellant's appeal from
his conviction under the by-law.

 

4.  District
Court of Ontario (Criminal Charge)

 

                   In
dismissing the appeal from the obstruction charge, Crossland Dist. Ct. J.
determined that Constable Coulis had been acting in the execution of his duty
as set out in s. 57 of the Police Act, in enforcing the by-law and in
attempting to prevent a continued breach of the by-law.   He held that
re-charging the appellant with by-law infractions would have been to no avail
and that the officer had no means of preventing further breaches other than to
lay the obstruction charge.

 

5.  Ontario
Court of Appeal (1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 147

 

                   The
appellant's appeals on both charges were heard together at the Ontario Court of
Appeal.  An appeal in R. v. Greenbaum, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 000, which also
dealt with the validity of the impugned by-law scheme, was heard separately by
the Court of Appeal, which issued one set of reasons for all three appeals.

 

                   On
behalf of the majority, Osborne J.A. began by pointing out that the lower
courts had erred in failing to note that the city of Toronto was not one of the
scheduled municipalities referred to in s. 11a of Metro By-law 211-74. 
However, he found that error had little significance because the combined
effect of Metro By-laws 211-74 and 97-80, and City of Toronto By-law 618-80,
was to include the city of Toronto in the scheme. Both the majority and the
dissent found that these by-laws had been validly enacted under ss. 210, para.
140 and 314(1), para. 1 (formerly ss. 210, para. 134, and 315, para. 1) of the Municipal
Act and that the Charter  arguments were without merit.

 

                   Before
the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the licensing scheme was
discriminatory in the municipal law or administrative law sense because it
impermissibly distinguished between street vendors and owners or occupants of
property adjoining the street.  Osborne J.A. considered the distinction in the
context of the nuisance addressed.  He found that Metro had a legitimate
interest in keeping its roads and sidewalks unobstructed and that the broad
purpose of Metro By-law 211-74 was to prohibit and regulate that interest.  As
for the distinction between street vendors and store vendors, he found that any
distinction in treatment was not discriminatory because the two were different
classes of vendors (at pp. 156-57):

 

In my opinion, there are significant differences between street
vendors, such as the appellants, and vendors who own or occupy abutting
commercial property; owner/occupant vendors may, by licence issued on occasion,
under the provisions of By-law 618-80, display their goods and wares on the
sidewalk and hold sidewalk sales, within defined areas.  They generally seek
short term specific uses of an abutting sidewalk.  They are required to pay
business property and utility taxes.  Street vendors are not.  Owners and
occupants of abutting properties are required to clear sidewalks of ice and
snow.  Street vendors have no such obligation.  I think that it is entirely
reasonable to draw a distinction between store vendors and street vendors such
as the appellants.  They are not members of the same class.

 

                   Osborne
J.A. distinguished both R. v. Varga (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 558 (Ont.
C.A.), and Montréal (City of) v. Arcade Amusements Inc., [1985] 1 S.C.R.
368, from the present case because in those cases the municipalities had
impermissibly discriminated within a class specified by the provincial
legislature.  He concluded that the regulatory distinction between street
vendors and store vendors did not detract from the scheme's validity because
regulatory schemes, by their very nature, are not intended to permit all
persons to participate in the regulated activity.

 

                   On
the criminal charge, Osborne J.A. found that the police officer had both common
law and statutory authority to enforce the by-law, founded upon the decision of
this Court in Johanson v. The King (1947), 3 C.R. 508, and s. 57 of the Police
Act.  He rejected the contention that the obstruction charge amounted to
double jeopardy for the same act and that the prevention of a repetition or
continuation of the appellant's breach of Metro By-law 211-74 should have been
achieved by resort to the offences and penalties contained within the by-law
itself, or by resort to injunctive relief as contemplated by s. 327 (formerly
s. 326) of the Municipal Act.  He held that the existence of other
avenues of relief did not erode the officer's authority to seek to enforce the
by-law.

 

                   In
her dissent, Arbour J.A. disagreed with the majority's conclusion that Metro
By-law 97-80 and City of Toronto By-law 618-80 were not discriminatory.  Arbour
J.A. held that, even if the distinction between free-standing street vendors
and owners/occupiers of abutting property was reasonable, this was not
conclusive of the by-laws' validity.  She stated that it is a well-established
rule of administrative law that the power to enact by-laws does not include the
power to enact discriminatory by-laws unless the enabling legislation provided
for the discrimination directly or by necessary implication.  She defined
discrimination in the administrative law sense as the drawing of a distinction
by a subordinate authority that is not authorized by the enabling legislation,
relying upon the decision of this Court in Montréal (City of) v. Arcade
Amusements Inc., supra.  In her view, the issue to be addressed was
not whether the distinction in the by-laws was reasonable given the context of
the nuisance involved, but whether the distinction is authorized.  She noted
that what has been called the ""neutral rule of discrimination"" has
often been used to strike down seemingly innocuous municipal legislation.  She
referred to the holding of this Court in Montréal (City of) v. Arcade
Amusements Inc., supra, as follows (at pp. 164-65):

 

... distinctions...are often perfectly reasonable in the narrow sense
that they are wise, rational or judicious; none the less, they must also be
reasonable in the legal sense that their wisdom is reserved to the sovereign,
rather than the subordinate, legislator.

 

                   Applying
the doctrine to the case before her, Arbour J.A. found at p. 168 that:

 

. . . none of the provisions of the Municipal Act authorize,
directly or by necessary implication, the distinction drawn in the by-laws
between two classes of street vendors.  The power to regulate the obstruction
or incumbrance of highways does not provide authority for municipalities to
discriminate between classes of persons who would be permitted to encumber the
roads.

 

                   Arbour
J.A. concluded that s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74, Metro By-law 97-80 and City
of Toronto By-law 618-80 created a discriminatory licensing scheme which could
only be corrected by striking down the prohibition contained in s. 11 of Metro
By-law 211-74 as well as Metro By-law 97-80 and City of Toronto By-law 618-80. 
Arbour J.A. therefore held that s. 11 of Metro By-Law 211-74, Metro By-law
97-80 and City of Toronto By-law 618-80 were ultra vires the powers
conferred on Metro and the city of Toronto by the Municipal Act and
would have ordered that they be quashed.

 

                   Arbour
J.A. also reached a different conclusion with respect to the appellant's
conviction under the Criminal Code .  Given the invalidity of the by-law
which the appellant was alleged to have breached, she held that the conviction
itself could not stand.  She went on to state, however, that the charge of
obstruction should fail even if the by-law had survived scrutiny.  In the
absence of a specific statutory direction or binding judicial authority
asserting that the peaceful repetition or continuation of an infraction against
the by-law in question could be brought to an end under the threat of a
criminal sanction, the use of the criminal charge of obstruction could not be
justified (at pp. 169-70):

 

                   The specific powers of enforcement of provincial
statutes and regulations as well as municipal by-laws are contained in the Provincial
Offences Act, R.S.O 1980, c. 400.  When Constable Coulis found the
appellant apparently infringing s. 11 of By-law 211-74, he was empowered, by
virtue of ss. 3 and 23 of the Provincial Offences Act, to issue a
certificate of offence, together with an offence notice or a summons, or to lay
an information before a justice of the peace, who may then have issued a
summons.

 

She continued (at p.
170):

 

                   There are no provisions, either in By-law 211-74 or
in the Provincial Offences Act, empowering the police to arrest without
a warrant nor to obtain an arrest warrant for that offence....

 

                   In my view, the deliberate legislative choice not to
permit arrest for this kind of municipal offence cannot be circumvented by a
police officer ordering the accused to desist from the conduct constituting
infringement of the by-law, thereby exposing the accused to liability for the Criminal
Code  offence of obstruction and thus triggering the arrest powers contained
in s. 495 of the Code....

 

                   Arbour
J.A (at pp. 170-71) held that such broad powers of arrest to enforce
municipal by-laws could not be found in s. 57 of the Police Act:

 

The general duties contained in s. 57 of the Police Act are
clearly subject to the specific statutory power given to the police to direct
them as to how to discharge these general duties.  For instance, the general
duty to apprehend  offenders cannot be relied upon to expand on the statutorily
limited powers of arrest without a warrant; the general duty to prevent crime
cannot expand the statutory authority of the police to search, seize or
wire-tap.  In the same way, the general duty to enforce municipal by-laws must
be read subject to the limited enforcement powers contained in the by-laws
themselves, in the Provincial Offences Act or in any other relevant
legislation, as well as in the common law powers incidental to them, such as
the power to search as an incident to a valid arrest.

 

                   Here the legislature has not seen fit to provide for
a mechanism by which the conduct prohibited by s. 11 of the by-law can be
immediately brought to a halt.  A police officer may invite a person to
desist.  He or she may issue a new summons if the offence is being repeated. 
However, the continuation of such conduct, absent circumstances amounting to a
breach of the peace or interfering with the authority of the police officer to
issue the summons, cannot amount to obstruction, in my opinion, even after the
alleged offender has been warned to stop his activities.

 

                   The legislature has addressed the problem of
repetition or continuation of infractions to municipal by-laws in s. 326 of the
Municipal Act, which provides that:

 

                   326.  Where any
by-law of a municipality or of a local board thereof, passed under the
authority of this or any other general or special Act, is contravened and a
conviction entered, in addition to any other remedy and to any penalty imposed
by the by-law, the court in which the conviction has been entered, and any
court of competent jurisdiction thereafter, may make an order prohibiting the
continuation or repetition of the offence by the person convicted.

 

                   Arbour
J.A rejected the argument of the respondents that Johanson v. The King, supra,
provides common law authority for an arrest.  She distinguished that case on the
basis that the by-law under which Johanson and Daniluk had been convicted
contained a specific requirement of ""obedience to police officers"". 
She took the view that subsequent decisions of this Court and others did not
grant as expansive an interpretation of the ratio of Johanson v. The King
as that for which the respondents contended.   She would have set aside the
conviction and entered an acquittal.

 

IV.  Analysis

 

1.  The
By-law Charge

 

                   I
agree with Arbour J.A. that this case is governed by the decision of this Court
in Montréal (City of) v. Arcade Amusements Inc., supra, with
respect to the discrimination in the by-law scheme.  In that case, the Court
held that the power to pass municipal by-laws does not entail that of enacting
discriminatory provisions (i.e., of drawing a distinction) unless in
effect the enabling legislation authorizes such discriminatory treatment.  See
also Rogers, The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations (2nd ed. 1971),
at pp. 406.3-406.4:

 

                   It is a fundamental principle of municipal law that
by-laws must affect equally all those who come within the ambit of the enabling
enactment.  Municipal legislation must be impartial in its operation and must
not discriminate so as to show favouritism to one or more classes of citizens. 
Any by-law violating this principle so that all the inhabitants are not placed
in the same position regarding matters affected by it is illegal.

 

                   The general principle does not apply where the
enabling statute clearly specifies that certain persons or things may be
excepted from its operation or expressly authorizes some form of
discrimination.

 

The rule against
discriminatory by-laws is an outgrowth of the principle that, as statutory
bodies, municipalities ""may exercise only those powers expressly conferred
by statute, those powers necessarily or fairly implied by the expressed power
in the statute, and those indispensable powers essential and not merely
convenient to the effectuation of the purposes of the corporation""
(Makuch, Canadian Municipal and Planning Law (1983), at p. 115).

 

                   The
Court of Appeal found that free-standing street vendors and owners/occupiers of
property abutting sidewalks are in different classes and could reasonably be
treated differently in the licensing scheme.  However, in Montréal (City of)
v. Arcade Amusements Inc., supra, this Court recognized that
discrimination in the municipal law sense was no more permissible between than
within classes (at pp. 405-6).  Further, the general reasonableness or
rationality of the distinction is not at issue:  discrimination can only occur
where the enabling legislation specifically so provides or where the
discrimination is a necessary incident to exercising the power delegated by the
province (Montréal (City of) v. Arcade Amusements Inc., supra, at
pp. 404-6).  Sections 210, para. 73, 210, para. 140 and 314(1),
para. 1 of the Municipal Act, do not, in my view, authorize any
discriminatory treatment, between free-standing street vendors and those owning
or occupying abutting property, in Metro By-law 97-80 and City of Toronto
By-law 618-80.

 

                   Before
this Court, the respondent argued that the discrimination in Metro By-law 97-80
and City of Toronto By-law 618-80 might find express authorization in s. 310(a)
of the Municipal Act.  For ease of reference, s. 310 is reproduced
again:

 

                   310.  By-laws may
be passed by the council of every local municipality,

 

                   (a)for leasing or licensing the use of untravelled
portions of highways under the jurisdiction of the council, except highways
that are extensions or connecting links of the King's Highway, to the owners or
occupants of adjoining property for such consideration and upon such terms and
conditions as may be agreed;

 

                   (b)for regulating and controlling the use, including
the use for parking purposes, of untravelled portions of highways under the
jurisdiction of the council that are not extensions or connecting links of the
King's Highway, which are leased or in respect of which a licence is granted
under clause (a).

 

The respondent argued
that the phrase ""untravelled portions of highways"" includes the
sidewalks adjacent to highways.  If sidewalks are ""untravelled portions of
highways,"" the respondent argues that s. 310(a) does authorize a
distinction between owners or occupants of adjoining property and other
persons.  Through application of the expressio unius est exclusio alterius
rule, the reference to owners or occupants in the provision implies that a
by-law may be passed excluding all other persons from the leasing and licensing
scheme.

 

                   I do
not agree with the respondent's submissions on this point.  While the Municipal
Act does not define ""untravelled portions of highways"",
s. 310(b) suggests that the phrase refers to untravelled portions of the
part of the highway reserved for vehicular traffic, rather than the sidewalk,
inasmuch as it permits usage of such untravelled portions for parking purposes. 
This conclusion is supported by s. 90 of the Municipality of Metropolitan
Toronto Act, which empowers Metro to delegate to area municipalities the
power to license use of ""sidewalks and untravelled portions of
Metropolitan roads"" (emphasis added).  The by-law provisions themselves
indicate that there is a distinction between ""untravelled portions of
highways"" and sidewalks.  Metro By-law 97-80, which delegates to the city
of Toronto the authority to enact a licensing scheme, provides as follows:

 

                   1. (1)  Notwithstanding the
provisions of By-law No. 211-74, as amended, the Council of each of the area
municipalities set out in Schedule ""A"" to this By-law is hereby
empowered to lease or license the use of sidewalks and untravelled portions
of Metropolitan roads within those portions of such area municipality in
which land may be used for commercial or industrial purposes to the owners in
possession or the occupants of adjoining properties for [enumerated purposes]. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

City of Toronto By-law
618-80 contains similar language.  There would have been no need to refer to
sidewalks in these provisions if sidewalks were included in ""untravelled
portions"" of roads or highways.

 

                   I
conclude, therefore, that s. 310 of the Municipal Act does not expressly
authorize a distinction between free-standing street vendors and owner/occupant
vendors.  The distinctions contained in Metro By-law 97-80 and City of Toronto
By-law 618-80 are therefore not authorized by the Municipal Act and those
by-laws are accordingly ultra vires the municipalities.

 

                   For
the reasons given by the Court in R. v. Greenbaum, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 000,
released concurrently with the reasons in the case at bar, I am also of the
view that s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74 is ultra vires the municipality. 
Therefore I need not address the question whether or not Arbour J.A. was
correct when she held that ""the illegal discrimination contained in the
licensing system can only be corrected by striking down the prohibition
contained in s. 11 of By-law 211-74"" (p. 169).  In other words, I
need not decide whether s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74 is severable from the
by-laws impugned herein.  I would therefore order that the appellant's
conviction on the by-law charge be set aside and that an acquittal be entered
instead.

 

2.  The
Criminal Charge

 

                   I
also agree with Arbour J.A. that the appellant's conviction for obstructing a
peace officer in the execution of his duty to enforce municipal by-laws must
also be set aside and an acquittal entered.  In charging the appellant with
obstructing a peace officer, Constable Coulis was attempting to enforce s. 11
of Metro By-law 211-74.  However, s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74 has been held by
this Court in R. v. Greenbaum to be ultra vires the municipality. 
As a result, the conviction of the appellant for obstructing a peace officer
cannot stand.

 

                   The
respondent, the Attorney General of Ontario, argued that this issue was
governed by the decision of this Court in R. v. Biron, [1976] 2 S.C.R.
56.  In that case, the accused was convicted of resisting arrest on a charge of
creating a disturbance, even though he was acquitted on the disturbance charge
itself.  In his defence, the accused submitted that the arrest itself was
unlawful since he had not in fact been committing an offence at the time.  A
majority of this Court rejected that argument.  Martland J. stated, at
p. 75:

 

The power of arrest...has to be exercised promptly, yet, strictly
speaking, it is impossible to say that an offence is committed until the party
arrested has been found guilty by the courts.  If this is the way in which this
provision [now s. 495  of the Criminal Code ] is to be construed, no peace
officer can ever decide, when making an arrest without a warrant, that the
person arrested is ""committing a criminal offence"".  In my
opinion...the power to arrest without a warrant is given where the peace
officer himself finds a situation in which a person is apparently committing an
offence.

 

The decision in R.
v. Biron, supra, did not concern the power of arrest without a
warrant where police officers believe themselves to be enforcing legislation
which is later found ultra vires.  Biron deals with apparent
perpetration of an offence, not apparent offences, and as such it cannot be
relied upon to confer on police the power to charge someone with obstruction
where there is an apparent violation of a law which itself is invalid.

 

                   In
my view, Arbour J.A. was correct in holding that, even if s. 11 of Metro By-law
211-74 were valid, the police cannot circumvent the lack of an arrest power for
a violation of the by-law by ordering someone to desist from the violation and
then charging them with obstruction.  The power to arrest in order to enforce
the by-law cannot be inferred in the face of clear language in the Municipal
Act and the Provincial Offences Act setting out more moderate means
of dealing with repeated infractions.  The officer had no authority, either at
common law or under statute, to arrest the appellant for failing to comply with
an order to desist from conduct prohibited by the by-law.  The power to arrest
without a warrant for disobeying an order to desist from conduct prohibited by
s. 11 of Metro By-law 211-74 cannot be founded upon the language of Metro
By-law 211-74, nor on ss. 3 and 23 of the Provincial Offences Act, nor
on s. 57 of the Police Act.  Johanson v. The King, supra,
has no application in the absence of a statutory duty of obedience to police
officers.  The police constable in this case indeed had an obligation to enforce
the by-law.  The legislature defined the enforcement power as ticketing the
offender, and the appellant did not obstruct the constable in the performance
of this duty.  The power of arrest cannot be derived as a matter of common law
from the officer's duty to enforce the by-law given the legislature's
definition of what such enforcement entails.  The words of Arbour J.A., at
p. 170, are apt:

 

                   In my view, the deliberate legislative choice not to
permit arrest for this kind of municipal offence cannot be circumvented by a
police officer ordering the accused to desist from the conduct constituting
infringement of the by-law, thereby exposing the accused to liability for the Criminal
Code  offence of obstruction and thus triggering the arrest powers contained
in s. 495 of the Code...

 

V.  Disposition

 

                   For
the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, and I would order that the
appellant's convictions both on the by-law charge and on the criminal charge be
set aside and acquittals entered instead.

us as of right by reason of a dissent in the Court of Appeal on the sole issue

briefly, as to the necessity of a nexus between the force applied and the
consent.  We are of the view, Justice Major dissenting, that the instructions

                   The following are
the reasons delivered orally by

 

                   Major J. (dissenting) ‑‑ In my
opinion, the instructions of the trial judge to the jury conveyed the direction
that there can be force without physical violence, that, in effect, if the
accused touched C. B., that was sufficient to prove force.  Coming, as it
did, early in the charge, I conclude, as did Austin J. (ad hoc),
that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had this not
occurred.

on appeal from the nova scotia supreme
court, appeal division

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Evidence ‑‑ Charge to jury ‑‑ Accused making
incriminating statement to police ‑‑ Accused stating at trial that
his ""confession"" was in fact a recounting of second‑hand
knowledge ‑‑ Trial judge instructing jury to reject accused's
statement to police if they had any reasonable doubt about it ‑‑
Whether trial judge's charge misleading.

 

                   Criminal law --
Appeals to Supreme Court of Canada -- Crown appeals -- Accused abandoning one
of his grounds of appeal -- Court refusing to hear Crown's arguments on point
since Crown had not cross-appealed -- Crown precluded from cross-appealing in
view of its overall success in court below -- Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c.
C-46 , s. 693(1) .

 

                   Criminal law --
Appeals -- Appeal from acquittal -- Standard of appellate review -- Court of
Appeal not misstating standard by requiring only that Crown show that jury's
verdict might have been different had it been properly instructed.

 

                   The accused was
arrested and charged with murdering three of his neighbours, who had been
killed with shots from his revolver.  He volunteered an incriminating statement
about the shootings and later, after he had requested legal counsel, started in
on a more detailed and explicit statement.  This second statement was excluded
by the trial judge because it was made after the accused had exercised his
right to counsel.  At trial, the accused said his ""confession"" to the
police was in fact a recounting of his second‑hand knowledge of the
shootings gained from other neighbours during the day of drinking following the
shootings.  The trial judge instructed the jury on how to evaluate the
contradiction between the accused's statement to the police and his testimony
at trial.  As part of this instruction he told them to ""reject
entirely"" the accused's statement to the police if they had any reasonable
doubt about it.  He also said that if the jury accepted the accused's
statement, then ""it will be considered by you with the other evidence that
you decide to accept"".  The jury found the accused not guilty on all
counts.  The Court of Appeal, in a majority decision, overturned the acquittal
and ordered a new trial.  The majority found that there had been a significant
misdirection by the trial judge, in that part of the charge may have suggested
to the jury that they should consider the accused's confession separate and
apart from the other evidence.

 

                   The accused's
appeal to this Court raised the issues of (1) whether the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that the accused's out-of-court inculpatory statement must
be rejected entirely if his testimony at trial raised any reasonable doubt
about it; (2) whether the trial judge erred in excluding from evidence the
accused's second statement to the police; and (3) whether the majority of the
Court of Appeal erred in holding that the verdict might have been different,
thereby usurping the jury's function.  At the hearing the accused abandoned the
second issue concerning the exclusion of his second statement to the police,
and the Crown then urged the Court to adopt a position in favour of a new trial
because of the excluded statement, but the Court refused to hear its argument
on this point. 

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed and the acquittal restored.

 

                   Per La Forest, Gonthier and
McLachlin JJ.:  On the first issue of the jury instruction, the
trial judge's charge, when viewed as a whole, was not misleading to the jury. 
In R. v. Morin, this Court determined that a jury charge is in error if
it leaves the jury with the impression that each item of evidence is to be
considered piecemeal against the criminal standard of proof or if the jury is
instructed to take a two-stage approach to their deliberations, whereby an
initial fact-finding stage would weed out certain items of evidence, leaving
the determination of guilt or innocence to be based only on the surviving
evidence.  In the case at bar, there was no general instruction to apply the
criminal standard of proof to items of evidence in isolation.  While the charge
does focus on one item of evidence, namely the accused's statement to the police,
the direction on this evidence is carefully couched in terms of all the other
evidence in the case.  The charge does not instruct the jury to divide its
deliberations into two phases, and there was almost no chance for the jury to
form the impression that ""the whole of the evidence"" was intended to
mean only the whole of the piecemeal bits of evidence already proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.

 

                   The contradiction
between the accused's out‑of‑court statement and his testimony at
trial was a key issue in the case, and the trial judge was entitled to give the
jury some guidance on how to handle this discrepancy in the evidence.  As a
matter of logic, the two stories could not be reconciled, and the judge's
suggestion that one of the statements must be ""rejected"", couched as
it was with the proviso that all of the other evidence must be taken into
account, in no way prejudiced the Crown.  The jury instruction was an accurate
reflection of the principle enunciated by this Court in Nadeau that an
accused's version of events is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as against
a competing version, providing the comparison is made having due regard to all
the evidence.  It is both acceptable and desirable for a trial judge to focus
the jury's attention on vital issues, and to direct their minds to the proper
burden of proof on those discrete questions.

 

                   While the statement
""it will be considered by you with the other evidence that you decide to
accept"", read in isolation, may be viewed as an erroneous statement of the
law, since it suggests that a determination of guilt should be based solely on
certain pre‑selected items of evidence, read in context it would not have
misdirected the jury.  This statement follows the trial judge's direction to
consider all the evidence in making a determination, and therefore could not be
interpreted as invoking a two‑stage process.  Consequently, the
instruction to the jury is in keeping with the rule in Morin and was not
in error.

 

                   On the second
issue, which was abandoned by the accused, the Crown had not cross-appealed nor
was it entitled to do so in view of its overall success in the court below. 
Under s. 693(1) of the Criminal Code , the Crown may appeal to this Court
only where the Court of Appeal has set aside a conviction or dismissed a Crown
appeal.  In this case the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, albeit on
a different issue.

 

                   On the third issue,
the Court of Appeal did not misstate the standard of appellate review by
requiring only that the Crown show that the jury's verdict might have been
different had it been properly instructed.  A test of ""might have been
different"" is simply the converse of ""would not necessarily have been
the same"", and is thus consistent with the test established by the
majority of this Court in Vézeau, which is the governing law today.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J.: 
La Forest J.'s reasons were substantially agreed with.  While it is a
misdirection to instruct juries to ""reject"" evidence, to tell juries
to reject factual propositions which the Crown's evidence does not establish
beyond a reasonable doubt is to state the law correctly.  The jury never
rejects evidence, but it can and must decide whether to accept or reject the
factual assertions made by that evidence before it uses them to support or infer
other factual assertions in reaching its verdict.  Such factual assertions can
only be accepted and used by the jury to convict the accused if they are
established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  Facts which are not so
established cannot corroborate or be allowed to ""bootstrap"" other
doubtful facts.  In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was not in
error in inviting the jury to ""reject"" the factual proposition in one
of the two statements, depending on which they believed, because both
statements emanated from the accused and could not logically co‑exist. 
There was only a single determination of credibility to be made.  If the jury
believed the accused's exculpatory evidence at trial, they must of necessity
have disbelieved his inculpatory statements to the police.  The accused need
never establish his version of events beyond a reasonable doubt, but must only
raise a reasonable doubt with his evidence, even where he bears an evidentiary
burden.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- I have had the
benefit of reading the reasons of Justice La Forest in this appeal, and I agree
substantially with his analysis of the issues before the Court and his
disposition of the appeal.  However, I feel compelled to add a few comments
which follow from my concurrence in Wilson J.'s reasons in R. v. Morin, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 345.  In retrospect, it appears to me that confusion exists in two
aspects of this area of the law:  (i) the essential distinction between facts
and evidence of facts in the process of the jury's deliberations, and (ii) the
relationship between credibility and the standard of proof in a criminal trial.

 

The Distinction Between Facts and
Evidence

 

                   In my view, it is
crucial to recognize the difference between the roles of ""facts"" and
""evidence of facts"" in a criminal trial; the failure to apply this
basic distinction has confused the debate on this issue.  As an example of this
tendency, see R. Eggleston, Evidence, Proof and Probability (2nd ed.
1983), who at p. 122 begins talking of ""facts that are not certainly
established"" but concludes with comments directed to the effect of
""evidence"" not being taken into account, and stating that a
requirement to prove evidence beyond a reasonable doubt obviates the entire
field of corroboration.  As I state below, doubtful evidence may be
corroborated by other evidence, even other doubtful evidence; doubtful facts,
however, cannot be corroborated by, or inferred from, other doubtful facts. 
Throughout many discussions of this point, the terms ""fact"" and
""evidence"" are used interchangeably, and thereby improperly.  It is
beyond question that the jury must always consider the whole of the evidence in
reaching their verdict, and that individual items of evidence are not to be
examined in isolation.  Evidence which may be doubtful standing alone may
nevertheless be corroborated or otherwise supported by other evidence, and the
jury is always to evaluate the evidence as a whole with a view to such
corroboration or support.  Therefore, it is an error to refer to the jury
""rejecting"" evidence at any stage of their deliberations.  All of the
evidence must always be considered.

 

                   However, the jury
can and must decide whether the whole of evidence establishes, beyond a
reasonable doubt, the individual facts necessary to support a conviction.  This
must, of necessity, be done in a sequential manner, and I agree with La Forest
J. that it is unrealistic to expect the jury to have an ""epiphanic""
experience in reaching its verdict.  In Morin, Wilson J. stated (at p.
378) that the process of the jury's deliberations with respect to the Crown
evidence ""requires a fact elicited through the mouth of a witness to be
assessed by the jury in the context of all the evidence and to be rejected if
it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.""  Therefore, while the
jury never rejects evidence, it can and must decide whether to accept or reject
the factual assertions made by that evidence before it uses those factual
assertions to support or infer other factual assertions towards reaching its
verdict.  Such factual assertions can only be accepted and used by the jury to
convict the accused if they are established by the evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Facts which are not so established cannot corroborate or be allowed to
""bootstrap"" other doubtful facts.  Any lower standard would present
the possibility that an accused could be convicted on the basis of facts which
are established as matters of conjecture only.

 

                   An analogy I often
used in charging juries, especially in cases where the Crown's case was
circumstantial, was that of a fisherman's net.  The evidence presented at trial
by the Crown seeks to establish factual propositions.  Once established, facts
may be used to infer other facts.  In this way, established factual
propositions intertwine to construct a net of such propositions.  If a factual
proposition is established as a mere probability or likelihood, and not beyond
a reasonable doubt, it cannot be used to infer any further facts.  The
interweaving of facts breaks down and there is a hole in the net.  A net with a
hole, however small, is no useful net at all, since there remains a critical
factual proposition which is not consistent only with the accused's guilt. 
Thus, a fact which is not established beyond a reasonable doubt can play no
part in the jury's decision to convict, either as a fact on which they rely to
find an essential element of the offence, or as a fact used to infer such
facts.

 

                   Therefore, while it
is a misdirection to instruct juries to ""reject"" evidence, to tell
juries to reject factual propositions which the Crown's evidence does not
establish beyond a reasonable doubt is to state the law correctly.

 

The Relationship Between Credibility
and the Standard of Proof

 

                   It is also
important to understand the relationship between the jury's assessment of
credibility and the criminal standard of proof when the jury is faced with
conflicting accounts from Crown and defence witnesses.  It is a clear error for
a trial judge to instruct the jury to choose the more believable, persuasive or
credible of the two accounts in such circumstances.  As with all facts on which
a conviction is to be supported, the factual propositions in the Crown
witnesses' evidence must be established by that and other evidence beyond a
reasonable doubt.  If the jury does not believe the Crown witnesses' version,
or any part of it, beyond a reasonable doubt, it cannot be used to convict the
accused, even if they do not believe the contrary version of the defence.  It
may very well be that both versions are wrong, and the accused is
entitled to the benefit of this doubt with respect to the credibility of any
witness.  This was my holding in Nadeau v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
570, in the passage cited by La Forest J. at pp. 27-28 of his reasons.

 

                   In the
circumstances of this case, however, the trial judge was not in error in
inviting the jury to ""reject"" the factual proposition in one of the
two statements, depending on which they believed, because both statements
emanated from the accused, and, as La Forest J. states, could not logically
co-exist.  There was only a single determination of credibility to be made.  If
they believed the accused's exculpatory evidence at trial, they must of
necessity have disbelieved his inculpatory statements to the police.  It must
be remembered, though, that the accused need never establish his or her version
of events beyond a reasonable doubt; that standard only and always applies to
the Crown.  The accused must only raise a reasonable doubt with his or her
evidence, even where he or she bears an evidentiary burden; see R. v.
Proudlock, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525.

 

                   With these
observations, I would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by La Forest
J.

 

//Le juge La Forest//

 

                   The judgment of La
Forest, Gonthier and McLachlin JJ. was delivered by

 

                   La
Forest J. -- The
appellant, John Alexander MacKenzie, was accused of murdering three of his
neighbours in the early hours of June 24, 1989.  At trial, a jury found him not
guilty.  The acquittal was overturned on appeal, and a new trial was ordered. 
The appellant appealed to this Court as of right, seeking the restoration of
his acquittal.

 

                   At the time of his
trial, the appellant was 47 years old.  He was an alcoholic.  In 1985, after
living for 25 years in Toronto, he moved back to his home community in rural
Antigonish County, Nova Scotia.  He purchased a plot of land in Beech Hill, and
in 1988 moved a mobile home onto the lot and made it his home.  The three
victims of the shooting, John Boucher, Joseph Deon and Edmund Deon, were
neighbours of the appellant.  Each owned a home on the Beech Hill Road within a
kilometre of the appellant's property.  The Deons were brothers, and were good
friends of Boucher.

 

                   For some reason,
the Deons and Boucher apparently engaged in a concerted campaign of harassment
against the appellant that lasted from the time he moved to Beech Hill until
their deaths.  This harassment verged on terrorism, consisting of repeated
property damage, the killing of the appellant's pets, shooting bullet holes
through his mailbox, and a series of threats to shoot him or dynamite his
trailer.

 

                   In the early
morning of Saturday, June 24, 1989 the Deons and Boucher were shot to death. 
Boucher was shot three times in his yard, Edmund Deon was shot seven times in
his bedroom, and Joseph Deon was shot twice while sitting at the wheel of his
pick-up truck, which was parked in his driveway.  All the shots came from the
appellant's .22 calibre revolver.  The revolver was retrieved by police the
next day from the appellant's well, along with a pair of his shoes.

 

                   During the six
weeks before the shootings the appellant was drinking heavily.  On June 12, two
weeks before the shootings, he discovered that a calf of his was missing. 
Suspecting his neighbours, he took his revolver and confronted Boucher and his
wife Lorraine at their home.  They were able to calm the appellant down, and
she drove him home.  At trial, the appellant testified that Lorraine Boucher
took his revolver from him at that time, and that this was the last he saw it. 
Mrs. Boucher did not testify on this point.  Later that evening, the appellant
decided to confront Edmund Deon about the calf.  He could not find his
revolver, so he took a .303 rifle with him.  During the confrontation that
ensued the appellant discharged the rifle into the floor of Deon's house.  The
next day the RCMP arrested the appellant, detained him overnight, and
confiscated his rifle.

 

                   On June 23 the
appellant spent most of the day drinking at his mobile home with his
brother-in-law, William Cogger.  The appellant consumed about 21 beers during
the day.  Boucher visited them for about an hour in the evening, drank at least
one beer, and left without any dispute or incident.  At around 11:00 p.m. the
appellant and Cogger went to sleep.  Sometime during the night, they were
awakened by a knock at the door.  Cogger testified that he heard the appellant
say ""who's there?"", that a voice responded, and that the appellant
said ""I'm sleeping. Go home. I'm going back to sleep"".  Cogger heard
nothing more, and fell back asleep.  The appellant testified that the visitor
was Joseph Deon.

 

                   At 4:17 a.m. Daniel
Girrior, another neighbour on the Beech Hill Road, was awakened by three
gunshots.  It was not unusual to hear gunshots at night in that area, so
Girrior went back to sleep.  William Cogger awoke at 4:45 a.m. to find the
appellant sitting fully dressed at a table.  Cogger testified that the
appellant said he got the ""three sons-of-whores last night.""  Cogger
said ""tell me this is not the truth"", to which the appellant replied
""no brother it's not true.""  The appellant then said he was going to
put his gun down the well, and left the house.  On returning, he spoke about
getting rid of his shoes.  At 4:58 a.m. Daniel Girrior heard three shots.  Two
minutes later he heard three more shots.

 

                   At trial, the
appellant testified that he fell back to sleep after Boucher's early morning
visit.  The next thing he remembered was waking up on the floor, with the idea
that he had seen the bodies of the Deons and Boucher on the Beech Hill Road. 
He felt he must have been dreaming, and told Cogger about the dream.  He was
surprised to see his revolver on the table, as he had not seen the gun since
Lorraine Boucher took it from him two weeks earlier.  The appellant had no
recollection of shooting the Deons and Boucher, or of throwing the revolver and
the shoes down the well.

 

                   The appellant and
Cogger spent the rest of June 24 drinking.  At about 9:00 p.m. the appellant
was arrested by the RCMP.  Realizing that he was drunk, the police did not
attempt to question him.  He was given food and at 11:30 p.m. was put in jail
for the night.

 

                   The next morning
the appellant was given breakfast, and then brought before two officers for
questioning.  He was advised of his right to silence and to counsel, and the
officers then told him they had reason to believe he had put his gun and shoes
down his well, and that he had previously been seen at the Boucher house.  They
asked the appellant for his side of the story, and he volunteered an
incriminating statement about the shootings.  One of the officers took notes
for about ten minutes, and then suggested that the statement should be in a
formal written form.  At this point the appellant requested legal counsel, and
the officers told the appellant that there would be no more questions.  The
officers left the appellant alone to call his sister so she could retain a
lawyer.  When they returned a pause of several minutes ensued when nothing was
said.  The accused then started in on a more detailed and explicit statement. 
This second statement was excluded by the trial judge because it was made after
the appellant had exercised his right to counsel.

 

                   At trial, the
appellant said his ""confession"" to the police was in fact a
recounting of his second-hand knowledge of the shootings gained from other
neighbours during the day of drinking following the shootings.  He remembers
little of his statements to the police, other than that he was suffering at the
time from ""the worst hangover of my life"".

 

                   During a four-hour
jury charge, MacIntosh J. instructed the jury on the law regarding the defences
of provocation and drunkenness, and that there were four possible verdicts on
each murder count: not guilty, guilty of first degree murder, second degree
murder, or manslaughter.  He also instructed the jury on how to evaluate the
contradiction between the appellant's statements to the police and his
testimony at trial.  Part of this instruction was as follows:

 

                   Here
we recall that the accused is saying he doesn't remember anything of what
happened, that these statements he gave is what he had heard from other
people.  If you decide to accept part or all of it, it will be considered by
you with the other evidence that you decide to accept.  You, of course, must
reach your verdict on the whole of the evidence that you decide is worthy of
belief.  The accused, as a witness, you can accept his earlier testimony as the
statement that the police -- the Crown alleges he made to the police.  You can
accept that as the truth of what happened (""He"" being the accused person)
as opposed to what he said in court.  This we cannot do with an ordinary
witness but with an accused, you are free to accept either, what he said in the
statement or what he said in court.  If you find that his evidence at trial
represented the true facts, or if you have any reasonable doubt about it, you
will reject entirely the earlier statement.  [Emphasis added.]

 

A majority of the Appeal Division of
the Nova Scotia Supreme Court found the underlined passage a significant
misdirection, in that it may have suggested to the jury that they should
consider the appellant's confession separate and apart from the other evidence.

 

                   After two hours of
deliberation, the jury asked to have the evidence of William Cogger, Lorraine
Boucher and Daniel Girrior read back.  After this, the jury deliberated for one
and a half days, and then returned a verdict of not guilty on all counts.

 

Judgments

 

                   The Crown appealed
the acquittal on a total of eleven grounds.  Only two of these were seriously
considered by the Appeal Division:  that MacIntosh J. erred in (1) excluding
the appellant's second out-of-court statement to the police, and (2)
instructing the jury to reject entirely the accused's first out-of-court
statement to the police if his testimony at trial raised any reasonable doubt
about it.  The appeal was allowed on the second ground; see (1991), 103 N.S.R.
(2d) 91.  Chipman and Hart JJ.A. wrote separate judgments for the majority,
Freeman J.A. dissented.

 

                   On the first
question, Chipman J.A. reviewed the governing case law on an accused's rights
to counsel and silence, and concluded that the police did nothing wrong in this
instance.  He reasoned that the duty of the police under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  does not go so far as to require them to
cease listening to unelicited statements that a detainee may make after
requesting counsel.  As such, Chipman J.A. found that the trial judge had erred
in excluding the statement.  However, he also found that the admission of the
statement would not necessarily have affected the jury's verdict, because the
crucial first statement had been put before the jury.  Hart J.A. agreed that
the trial judge had erred in excluding the second statement, but in his view
the exclusion might have materially affected the jury's deliberations.  He
would have ordered a new trial on this ground.  Freeman J.A. differed from his
colleagues, concluding that the trial judge was correct in excluding the
statement.  In the result, the Crown's appeal on this first ground was
dismissed.

 

                   On the second
question, Chipman J.A. reviewed the jury charge, referred to R. v. Morin,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 345; R. v. Minhas (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont.
C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1987] 2 S.C.R. viii, and Nadeau v. The
Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, and concluded as follows, at pp. 109-10:

 

                   On
reading the trial judge's charge in its entirety, I have the same concern as
did Sopinka, J., in Morin, that the instruction to regard the evidence
as a whole was not sufficient to correct the impression they might well have
got, that they were to examine the Crown's evidence about the confession in
isolation without taking into account the evidence as a whole in determining if
it established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It seems to me that basically
the same error was made here as was made in Morin.

 

                   Moreover,
this error was of sufficient gravity that it cannot be said that had it not
been made the result would necessarily have been the same.  Sopinka, J., said
in Morin, supra, the charge with respect to the burden of proof lays
down for the jury one of the most fundamental rules of the game.  The
confession was undoubtedly a crucial part of the Crown's case.  Without it, the
jury could easily have formed a reasonable doubt.  With it, it is difficult to
see how a reasonable doubt as to some degree of guilt at least could be
entertained.  It can therefore be said with a reasonable degree of certainty
that the outcome may have been affected by the misdirection relating to the
confession.  The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

Hart J.A. shared Chipman J.A.'s view
that the instruction was incorrect, finding that it permitted the jury to apply
the doctrine of reasonable doubt to parts of the evidence rather than to the
evidence as a whole, and that the overall instruction did not remedy this
defect.

 

                   In dissent, Freeman
J.A. conceded that the language used in the trial judge's charge to the jury
raised the possibility of a misdirection, but he did not agree that an error
warranting a new trial had been made.  He reasoned as follows, at pp. 133-35:

 

                   At
its worst, the part of the charge in question, balanced as it is by
instructions that the whole of the evidence must be considered, is not so clear
as to cause the jury to override their common sense and prematurely exclude a
piece of evidence as important as the statement.  Once accepted as possibly
true, common sense would dictate that the statement remain part of their
deliberations to be rejected as a true description of events only when the
whole of the evidence including the statement failed to persuade them beyond a
reasonable doubt of the respondent's guilt.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   If
one were to assume that as a result of Mr. Justice MacIntosh's charge, the jury
thought their duty was to apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
to the statement as a piece of evidence in isolation from the other evidence,
how might they have proceeded?  They could only reject the statement in
isolation if it raised a reasonable doubt within itself, if it contained
contradictions or inconsistencies that might realize a reasonable doubt.  No
such internal flaws are apparent.  Therefore it had to be considered in the
light of other evidence.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

In
considering the truth of [the appellant's] evidence about the statement, the
jury had been instructed to take into account corroboration, circumstances and
the condition of the accused.  That is to say, the jury was instructed to
consider the statement with the whole of the evidence.  The charge would be
objectionable only if it could be seen as directing the jury to reject the
statement before it had done so.  It is difficult to see how the jury might
have considered the statement except in the context of all of the other
evidence.  It did not lend itself to consideration in either total or partial
isolation.

 

Accordingly, Freeman, J.A. would have
dismissed this ground of appeal.

 

Points in Issue

 

1.Whether
the trial judge erred in law in instructing the jury that the appellant's
out-of-court inculpatory statement must be rejected entirely if his testimony
at trial raised any reasonable doubt about it.

 

2.Whether
the trial judge erred in law in excluding from evidence certain statements made
by the appellant to police officers.

 

3.Whether
the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the verdict
might have been different, thereby usurping the function of the jury.

 

Analysis

 

                   All three of the
points in issue were argued in written submissions to this Court, but at the
commencement of the hearing appellant's counsel abandoned the second issue
concerning the exclusion of the appellant's second statement to the police. 
This abandonment created certain procedural difficulties for the respondent,
which I will comment on briefly before turning to the remaining issues, which
concern the charge to the jury.

 

The Excluded Statement

 

                   In the court below,
the Crown won a partial victory on the excluded confession:  a majority found
that the trial judge had erred in excluding it, but only Hart J.A. would have
ordered a new trial because of this error.  The appellant appealed only the
first point of law to this Court, arguing that the trial judge had not erred. 
I presume the reason for appealing on this point was to foreclose the admission
of the statement at a new trial, in the event that this Court upholds the
decision of the court below that such a re-trial is necessary.  In any event,
as I have noted, the appellant eventually abandoned this ground of appeal.  As
the hearing of this appeal progressed, the Crown urged this Court to adopt Hart
J.A.'s minority position in favour of a new trial because of the excluded
statement.  The Chief Justice pointed out that the Crown had not cross-appealed
on this point, and indeed was not entitled to cross-appeal.  Accordingly, the
Court refused to hear the Crown's arguments on this issue.

 

                   Our refusal to hear
the Crown on this point was based on the limited scope for Crown appeals to
this Court, as determined by s. 693(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.,
1985, c. C-46 :

 

                   693. (1)  Where a judgment of
a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under
section 675 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 676(1)(a),
(b) or (c) or subsection 676(3), the Attorney General may appeal
to                                         the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a)
on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents; or

 

(b)
on any question of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of
Canada.  [Emphasis added.]

 

The problem for the Crown in this case
is that the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, albeit on a
different issue than that which the Crown sought to pursue in this Court.  The
Crown's overall success in the court below precluded any further appeal, or
cross-appeal, to this Court.

 

                   A similar question
was recently considered by this Court in R. v. Barnes, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
449.  In that case, a trial judge stayed proceedings in a drug case because of
entrapment.  The Crown appealed, seeking a reversal of the stay and a
substitution of convictions against the accused.  The appeal was successful in
part:  the Court of Appeal lifted the stay, but ordered a new trial rather than
entering convictions.  The accused appealed, and although the Crown did not cross-appeal
it argued not only that the lifting of the stay should be affirmed, but that
this Court should impose the convictions that the Court of Appeal had refused. 
Lamer C.J., writing for the majority, rejected the Crown's arguments on this
latter point.  He found that s. 693 of the Code has no application when
a Crown appeal has been allowed.  Moreover, Lamer C.J. relied on Guillemette
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 356, in finding that this Court's
jurisdiction to vary a judgment of a court of appeal (pursuant to s. 695 of the
Code) applies only when there is a valid Crown appeal before the Court. 
He concluded with the following passage, at p. 466:

 

                   In
the absence of an appeal by the Crown, this Court has no jurisdiction to allow
the Crown's request that the order below be modified.  To hold otherwise would
allow the Crown to appeal to this Court where such an opportunity has not been
provided by the Criminal Code  or the Supreme Court Act.  The
Crown is not given by statute the ability to appeal to this Court a decision
which allowed its appeal from an acquittal or judicial stay of
proceedings, but which gave the Crown less than what had been
requested.  As a result, there is no statutory provision which would allow the
Crown to appeal from the Court of Appeal's judgment.  Absent a statutory right
of appeal, there is no right of appeal.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

In my view, this reasoning is directly
applicable to the present situation.  As in Barnes, a court of appeal
has allowed a Crown appeal, thereby precluding any appeal, or cross-appeal, by
the Crown to this Court.  The subdivision of a case on appeal into discrete
grounds does not assist the Crown in this regard: an unfavourable ruling by a
court of appeal on one point of law is overtaken by the Crown's success on
other grounds.

 

                   In the result,
since the second ground of appeal has been abandoned by the appellant, it is
unnecessary for this Court to consider the Appeal Division's decision regarding
the exclusion of the accused's second statement.

 

The Jury Charge

 

                   I turn now to the
first ground of appeal, which concerns the charge to the jury on the accused's
first statement to the police.  All three judgments at the Appeal Division
concluded that the jury instruction was to some degree flawed in that it might
have left the jury with the impression that it was required to consider the
out-of-court statement separate and apart from the evidence as a whole.  The
majority concluded that this error warranted a new trial, but in dissent
Freeman J.A. found that any error was cured by other elements of the charge. 
Before considering the charge and these judgments in detail, it is useful to
review R. v. Morin, supra, as that decision looms large in the
debate in the court below and before this Court.

 

                   In Morin,
this Court found that a jury charge will be in error if it leaves the jury with
the impression that each item of evidence is to be considered piecemeal against
the criminal standard of proof.  As well, a majority found that it is an error
to instruct a jury to take a two-stage approach to their deliberations, whereby
an initial fact-finding stage would weed out certain items of evidence, leaving
the determination of guilt or innocence to be based only on the surviving
evidence.  The jury charge at issue in Morin is reproduced in the
majority reasons (at p. 355) beginning with the following general instruction:

 

                   You
are not obliged to accept any part of the evidence of a witness just because
there is no denial of it.  If you have a reasonable doubt about any of the
evidence you will give the benefit of that doubt to the accused with respect to
such evidence.  Having decided what evidence you consider worthy of belief,
you will consider it as a whole, of course, in arriving at your verdict. 
[Emphasis added by Sopinka J.]

 

Later in the charge, the trial judge
stated that the doctrine of reasonable doubt did not apply to each individual
item of evidence, but rather to the whole of the case and to ""the total
body of evidence"".  However, he then gave a series of instructions on
particular items of evidence, each of which suggested that the criminal
standard was to be applied, in isolation, to that item.  For example, with
regard to certain hair and fibre evidence, the trial judge said:

 

                   It
seems to me that this evidence does not go beyond proving that Christine could
have been in the Honda motor vehicle and that the accused could have been at
the scene of the killing and, of course, that is not proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.

 

Sopinka J., writing for the majority,
found that the charge as a whole was misleading to the jury.  He commented as
follows, at p. 356:

 

                   In
my opinion, based on my reading of the charge as a whole, a jury would likely
have concluded that in examining the evidence they were to give the accused the
benefit of the doubt in respect of any evidence.  This process of
examination and elimination would occur during the so-called ""fact
finding"" stage, to use the appellant's phrase.  The evidence as a whole to
which the jury was to apply itself in order to determine guilt or innocence was
the residuum after the ""fact finding"" stage.  There is no other way
of reading the first excerpt from the charge.  [Emphasis in original.]

 

Sopinka J. rejected the argument that
the trial judge's second instruction cured the erroneous impression left by the
first (at p. 356):

 

The
second excerpt refers to the ""whole of the case"" and the ""total
body of evidence"".  Having been told earlier that the ""whole""
upon which the verdict was to be based consisted of the evidence that had been
accepted, I am not satisfied that the jury would have interpreted this passage
as a correction.  Rather, they might very well have assumed that the earlier
definition of the ""whole"" still applied.  At best, from the appellant's
standpoint the jury would be confused.  Subsequent passages in the charge
illustrate what is meant by the first excerpt and would confirm that individual
pieces of evidence were to be examined by reference to the criminal standard.

 

Thus, the reversible error in Morin
arose from the combined effect of two misdirections.  The first was that the
jury should assess the evidence in piecemeal fashion.  This was exacerbated by
the instruction to break the jury deliberations into two stages.  In the end,
Sopinka J. concluded, at p. 358:

 

                   The
effect of the misdirections referred to above may very well have been that the
jury examined evidence that was crucial to the Crown's case in bits and
pieces.  Standing alone or pitted against the evidence of the accused without
the support of other evidence, much of this evidence might have been discarded
as not measuring up to the test.  When the jury came to consider the Crown's
case as a whole there may not have been very much left of it.  We cannot know
for certain, but this scenario is a very likely one and the charge therefore
constituted a serious misdirection.

 

With these findings from Morin
in mind, I turn now to the jury charge in the present case.

 

                   In argument before
this Court, the respondent focused on one particular passage in the charge,
which instructed the jury members to ""reject entirely"" the accused's
statement to the police if they had any reasonable doubt about it.  It seems
that the respondent's real complaint is with this single sentence, although
other passages are impugned, and I will discuss them all.

 

                   The charge lasted
over four hours, with two short breaks.  MacIntosh J. organized his address to
the jury as follows: general principles of a criminal trial, specific
principles regarding murder, the theories of the Crown and defence, review and
comment on the evidence, and finally general instructions on the available
verdicts.  The relevant portions of the charge are set out below, and for ease
of reference I have lettered the paragraphs A to G.  The impugned passages are
underlined.

 

                   At the outset the
trial judge explained the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  He then
said:

 

[A]
The accused is entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt on the whole of the
case with respect to each count, and on each and every issue in the case.  If
after considering the whole of the case and the submissions made on behalf of
the accused you entertain a reasonable doubt of guilt, you must resolve that
doubt in his favour and acquit him.

 

The judge then turned to the question
of the accused's testimony.  He stated:

 

[B]              In
this case the accused himself gave evidence, and he is in the same position as
any other witness as far as his credibility is concerned.  Shortly I will
instruct you how to weigh testimony, but for the present let me tell you that
if you believe the accused, that he did not commit the offense, or what he did
lacked some essential element of the offense, which I'll describe later, or if
the evidence of the accused, either standing alone or taken together with all
the other evidence, leaves you in a state of reasonable doubt, then you must
acquit him.  But if upon consideration of all the evidence, the arguments of
counsel, that you are satisfied that the accused has been proven guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt, it is your duty to convict.

 

Counsel for the respondent contended
that paragraph A, in directing the jury to give the accused the benefit of
reasonable doubt ""on each and every issue in the case"", exacerbated
the putative errors which follow.  I do not agree.  It is entirely correct to
state that the accused has the benefit of the doubt on each ""issue"",
which is a reference to the Crown's burden of proving each element of the offence
charged. 

 

                   MacIntosh J. next
gave a summary of the factors to be considered in weighing testimony, and
stressed that the jury was not obliged to accept what a witness says.  He then
reviewed the law relating to the charge of murder and its included offences. 
Following this he turned to the portion of the charge to which the Crown
objects.  It deals with how the jury should approach its consideration of the
appellant's statements to the police.  He stated:

 

[C]              Statements
of the accused:  You've heard evidence that -- it'd be from the evidence of
Sergeant Peebles and Constable Cleary regarding statements to have been made by
the accused to them on June the 25th.  The fact that evidence of this -- these
statements were given does not mean that they were made or that they were
true.  That's up for you to decide.  It's for you to decide whether the
statements were made and if you have a reasonable doubt about whether or not a
particular statement was made in whole or in part, you must reject it entirely
or reject those parts as to which you have a reasonable doubt as to the
making.  If you find the statements were made, you may believe all the
statement, part of it, or you can reject them entirely.  You are the sole
judges whether an unsworn statement alleged to have been made by the accused in
whole or in part is an acknowledgment by the accused of the truth of the
matters contained in it.

 

[D]              In
determining whether or not the accused's statement is true in whole or in part,
you might consider the following, one, has there been any corroboration by
independent evidence of important parts of it, the circumstances leading up to
the making of it, and the circumstances under which it was made, the condition
of the accused at the time he is alleged to have made it?  Statements were not
given under oath, but you may act on those parts which in your judgment are an
acknowledgement by the accused of the truth of the facts in the statement.

 

[E]               Here
we recall that the accused is saying he doesn't remember anything of what
happened, that these statements he gave is what he had heard from other
people.  If you decide to accept part or all of it, it will be considered by
you with the other evidence that you decide to accept.  You, of course,
must reach your verdict on the whole of the evidence that you decide is worthy
of belief.  The accused, as a witness, you can accept his earlier testimony as
the statement that the police -- the Crown alleges he made to the police.  You
can accept that as the truth of what happened (""He"" being the accused
person.) as opposed to what he said in court.  This we cannot do with an
ordinary witness but with an accused, you are free to accept either, what he
said in the statement or what he said in court.  If you find that his
evidence at trial represented the true facts, or if you have any reasonable
doubt about it, you will reject entirely the earlier statement.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

All the instructions to this point were
given in the first part of the jury charge.  Towards the end of the charge,
while reviewing the evidence, the trial judge recalled the accused's statement
to the police and commented:

 

[F]               Now
you remember what I told you about statements of an accused persons and how you
deal with it.  You've seen the circumstances under which it was taken and you
have the evidence of the condition of the accused at the time and so on.  The
evidence of Sergeant Peebles and Constable Cleary I found -- (That's up to you.) 
I found it pretty straight forward.

 

[G]              You
will recall that the accused is saying that that statement which I have just
read was made up from what he had heard from other people.  That's up for you
to decide if that's true or not.  Look at that statement and see whether all
the information contained in it could have been obtained from other people or
did it have to come from the accused itself.

 

That is the last of the relevant
portions of the instruction to the jury.  

 

                   As the underscoring
suggests, the respondent points to three passages as reversible errors,
although as I have noted counsel focused principally on the last sentence in
paragraph E.  I will consider each of the passages in detail, but it is
important at the outset to make certain general observations about the charge. 
First, it seems to me that this charge is readily distinguishable from that in Morin. 
In that case the trial judge directed the jury to consider the evidence in
piecemeal bits, and compounded that error by instructing the jury to break
their deliberations into two stages.  These errors were exacerbated by repeated
instructions on specific items of evidence, all of which suggested a piecemeal
approach and said nothing about considering that evidence with due regard to
all the other evidence.  In the present case there is no general instruction to
apply the criminal standard of proof to items of evidence in isolation.  The
charge does focus on one item of evidence -- the appellant's statement to the
police -- but the direction on this evidence is carefully couched in terms of
all the other evidence in the case.  Each time the trial judge addresses the
appellant's statement he is careful to return to the ""whole of the
evidence"".  In Morin, by contrast, the charge to the jury on
individual items of evidence never made this link.  Finally, the charge in the
present case does not instruct the jury to divide its deliberations into two
phases.  It is true that the first part of paragraph E refers to reaching a
verdict ""on the whole of the evidence that you decide is worthy of
belief"", but this stops short of suggesting a two-stage process.  The choice
of words is perhaps unfortunate, but I do not believe that this passing
reference would have misled the jury.

 

                   In this case,
unlike Morin, there was almost no chance for the jury to form the
impression that ""the whole of the evidence"" was intended to mean only
the whole of the piecemeal bits of evidence already proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Appellant's counsel pointed out that the trial judge gave fourteen
distinct warnings to consider the evidence as a whole.  These warnings, which
occurred before, during and after the excerpts of the charge repeated above,
strongly militate against any possibility that the jurors may have misconceived
their role.  I note also that the Crown took no exception to the jury charge at
the time it was delivered.  This is of course of no great moment, but it does
suggest that any misdirection was not readily apparent to those who heard the
charge.

 

                   As a final general
comment, it is important to keep in mind just what MacIntosh J. was striving to
achieve in these impugned passages.  The contradiction between the accused's
out-of-court statement and his testimony at trial was a key issue in the case,
and the trial judge was entitled, in his review of the evidence, to give hints
to the jury on how to assess such important issues; see Morin at p.
361.  MacIntosh J. suggested that the jury focus on the two statements, and
pointed out that as a matter of logic the two could not coexist.  In my view
his suggestion that one of the statements must be ""rejected"", couched
as it was with the proviso that all of the other evidence must be taken into
account, in no way prejudiced the Crown.

 

                   I turn now to the
first and third of the impugned passages in the charge to the jury.  In
speaking about the accused's statement, the trial judge instructed the jurors
in paragraph C that they must reject the accused's statement if they had
a reasonable doubt as to whether the statement was made.  In paragraph E he
returned to this point with respect to the content of the first statement, and
again invited the jury to reject the statement if they had a reasonable doubt
as to its veracity.  Chipman J.A. found the latter statement to be
objectionable, and also stated a concern about the passage in paragraph C.

 

                   Chipman J.A. noted
that paragraph C was virtually the same as an instruction disapproved by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Minhas, supra.  The latter
charge is reproduced in the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision at p. 209:

 

However,
it is for you to decide in each instance whether the statements alleged to have
been made by the accused were in fact made to the police or to Vijay Gupta or
to Nishi Gupta.  If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether any particular
statement relied upon by the Crown was made in whole or in part, then you must
reject it entirely or reject those parts about which you have a reasonable
doubt in the making.  If you are satisfied that the statement was made, then it
is for you to determine whether it amounted to an acknowledgement of guilt by
the accused.

 

Commenting on this instruction, Martin
J.A. said this, at p. 210:

 

                   I
observe that the instruction that the jury must be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the statements alleged to have been made by the appellant
were, in fact, made by her, and that they constituted an acknowledgement of
guilt, was, in my view, more favourable to the appellant than the instruction
to which she was by law entitled.  The jury must on all the evidence be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt in order to convict. 
If the jury at the end of the case entertains a reasonable doubt as to the
accused's guilt they must acquit.  The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt does not, however, apply to each individual item of evidence that makes
up the Crown's case.... [Emphasis in original.]

 

Minhas was decided before Morin, but Martin
J.A.'s statement of the law is largely consistent with the approach taken by
this Court in Morin, and I have no doubt that Martin J.A. was correct in
pointing out that all of the evidence must be considered when
determining the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  In Minhas
it appears that there was no instruction accompanying the ""rejection""
charge to emphasize that the decision to reject evidence could only be taken in
light of all the evidence.  As such, Martin J.A. was correct to observe that
the charge before him was in error.  In the present case, however, the impugned
paragraphs C and E must be read with paragraph D, in which MacIntosh J. gave
the jury explicit directions on how to assess the conflicting statements of the
accused in light of all the evidence: they should consider ""corroborating
independent evidence"", the ""circumstances leading up to"" the
making of the first statement, and the ""condition of the accused"". 
So as to further emphasize this point, the trial judge returns to it in
paragraphs F and G, which are his last words on the subject of the accused's
conflicting evidence.  Here again we find another direction to consider the
appellant's statement in light of the other evidence from the trial.

 

                   In my view it is
acceptable for a trial judge to focus the jury's attention on the vital issues
of its inquiry.  Perhaps the jury should not be directed to compartmentalize
their deliberations, but at the same time it is unrealistic to view a jury's
decision as some epiphanic pronouncement of guilt or innocence; rather, the
jurors engage in a deliberate process of evaluating the evidence presented to
them.  In this case, the jury deliberated for two days on evidence from a trial
that lasted more than three weeks.  To restrain jurors from rejecting evidence
during this process is to impose an artificial constraint on their mandate. 
Having said this, a trial judge should proceed with the utmost caution in
advising the jury that certain evidence may be ""rejected"".  If the
trial judge ventures into this realm, then the advice must be complete -- he or
she must go on to stress to the jury that this rejection must not be done in
isolation -- the evidence is not to be evaluated in a piecemeal fashion.

 

                   I do not view this
discretion of a trial judge to instruct on ""rejecting"" evidence as
some exception to, or modification of this Court's disapproval of a two-stage
process of evaluating evidence.  Rather, it is merely a reflection of the
reality of jury deliberations -- on important items of evidence the jury may
require guidance on how to approach its task.  As in this case, where a
statement by an accused at trial is entirely at odds with a previous
out-of-court statement by the accused, and the jury believes the statement at
trial, or is left in reasonable doubt that it is true, then the jury must
reject the out-of-court statement; the accused must be given the benefit of the
doubt.  In arriving at that conclusion, the jury should, of course, give
consideration to the evidence as a whole.

 

                   At this juncture I
would emphasize that the jury's ""rejection"" of evidence goes to the
veracity of that evidence rather than its admissibility.  The latter
consideration is, of course, wholly within the province of the trial judge.  On
this point Freeman J.A. aptly commented in the court below (at p. 133):

 

                   The
concern with Mr. Justice MacIntosh's charge is his use of the word
""reject"" while speaking of reasonable doubt as to the statement.  If
the meaning of ""reject"" were equated with ""exclude"", this
could be problematical.  However the jury must have known they could not
exclude any evidence because they were instructed that their verdict had to be
on the whole of the evidence.  The ordinary meaning of ""reject"" is to
refuse to accept, and on the whole of the charge there is no reason to conclude
the jury would have understood it in any other sense.  In that light if the
jury understood they were to refuse to accept the statement as proof of the
events it described until they were satisfied of the guilt of the accused on
the whole of the evidence including the statement, I can see no difficulty.

 

Thus the ""rejection"" of certain
evidence during the jury's deliberations does not engage a two-stage process.

 

                   The contradictory
statements of the accused were a key element of this trial, and the judge was
entitled to give the jury some guidance on how to handle this discrepancy in
the evidence.  As a matter of logic, the two stories could not be reconciled,
and the advice to reject one of them is one way to deal with the dilemma.  When
a judge ventures into this kind of instruction, a reviewing court will have two
concerns: (1) the jury must know that their job is not to choose the most
believable of the versions, but that the version most favourable to the accused
is entitled to the benefit of the doubt; and (2) the two versions cannot be
simply pitted against one another in isolation, rather all of the other
evidence must also be considered.

 

                   The first of these
concerns was considered in this Court's decision in Nadeau v. The Queen,
supra.  In that case, two contradictory versions of the events leading
up to a murder were presented: one by the accused, the other by a Crown
witness.  The judge told the jury that they must choose between the two
versions, and then said the following, which is reproduced at p. 572 of this
Court's decision:

 

[translation]  I will simply
say that in deciding how you make your choice, you must have one thing clearly
in mind: you must choose the more persuasive, the clearer version
....

 

                   You
must keep in mind that, as the accused has the benefit of the doubt on all the
evidence, if you come to the conclusion that the two (2) versions are
equally consistent with the evidence, are equally valid, you must give --
you must accept the version more favourable to the accused.  [Emphasis added by
Lamer J.]

 

Lamer J. (as he then was), writing for
the Court at pp. 572-73, assessed this instruction in the following terms:

 

                   With
respect, this direction is in error.  The accused benefits from any reasonable
doubt at the outset, not merely if ""the two (2) versions are equally
consistent with the evidence, are equally valid"".  Moreover, the jury does
not have to choose between two versions.  It is not because they would not
believe the accused that they would then have to agree with Landry's version. 
The jurors cannot accept his version, or any part of it, unless they are
satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having regard to all the evidence, that
the events took place in this manner; otherwise, the accused is entitled,
unless a fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, to the finding of
fact the most favourable to him, provided of course that it is based on
evidence in the record and not mere speculation.

 

Although disapproving the charge as
framed in that case, Lamer J. in Nadeau endorses the idea that a jury
should be charged to ""reject"" inculpatory evidence contrary to an
accused's statements if, having regard to all the evidence, the jury has
a reasonable doubt about it.  The jury instruction in the present case is an
accurate reflection of the law as stated in Nadeau:  an accused's
version of events is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as against a
competing version, providing the comparison is made having due regard to all
the evidence.

 

                   The dual concerns
of a reviewing court were considered together by Sopinka J. in Morin, at
pp. 361-62:

 

While
the charge may and often does include many helpful tips on the weighing of
evidence such as observing demeanour, taking into account the interest of the
witness and so forth, the law lays down only one basic requirement: during the
process of deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the
evidence as a whole and determine whether guilt is established by the
prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt....

 

                   The
reason we have juries is so that lay persons and not lawyers decide the facts. 
To inject into the process artificial legal rules with respect to the natural
human activity of deliberation and decision would tend to detract from the
value of the jury system.  Accordingly, it is wrong for a trial judge to lay
down additional rules for the weighing of the evidence.  Indeed, it is unwise
to attempt to elaborate on the basic requirement referred to above. I would
make two exceptions.  The jury should be told that the facts are not to be
examined separately and in isolation with reference to the criminal
standard....

 

                   The
second exception is that it is appropriate where issues of credibility arise
between the evidence for the prosecution and the defence that the jury be
charged as suggested by Morden J.A. in Challice, [infra].  There
is a danger in such a situation that a jury might conclude that it is simply a
matter as to which side they believe.  The suggested charge alerts them to the
fact that, if the defence evidence leaves them in a state of doubt after
considering it in the context of the whole of the evidence, then they are to
acquit.

 

The charge Sopinka J. was referring to
is found in the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in R. v. Challice
(1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546, at p. 557:

 

                   Understandably,
a jury have to give careful consideration to issues of credibility when
deliberating upon their verdict, and with respect to various pieces of evidence
they may have differing views: total acceptance, total rejection, or something
in between.  An effective and desirable way of recognizing this necessary part
of the process, and putting it to the jury in a way that accurately comports
with their duty respecting the burden and standard of proof, is to instruct the
jury that it is not necessary for them to believe the defence evidence on a
vital issue -- but that it is sufficient if it, viewed in the context of all
the evidence, leaves them in a state of reasonable doubt as to the accused's
guilt....

 

It seems to me that MacIntosh J.
instructed the jury in exactly the manner prescribed by Challice, and
such a charge was appropriate in this case.  This is made clear by Sopinka J.'s
use of the Challice charge in Morin.  There, certain out-of-court
statements made by the accused were tendered in evidence against him, and the
accused presented a competing version of the meaning of his statements at trial
(exactly the situation in the present case).  It was with reference to this
problem that Sopinka J. allowed, at p. 357, that a jury should be charged as in
Challice -- ""where the credibility of defence evidence is at
issue"".  It was precisely this scenario that confronted the jury in the
present case, and for the reasons stated by Sopinka J. in Morin the charge
by MacIntosh J. was entirely appropriate.

 

                   Morin demonstrates that it is both
acceptable and desirable for a trial judge to focus the jury's attention on
vital issues, and to direct their minds to the proper burden of proof on those
discrete questions; see also R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at pp.
700-701.  In my view, this is exactly what the trial judge has done in the
present case.  As Freeman J.A. commented in the court below, at p. 134,
""... the words of Mr. Justice MacIntosh referred to above, to say nothing
of his instructions as a whole, would have left the jury in a state of mind no
different than if he had charged them in the words of Mr. Justice Lamer in Nadeau.""

 

                   I turn now to the
final passage of concern, which is found in the first part of paragraph E.  The
trial judge commented there that if the jury accepted the accused's statement
to the police, then ""it will be considered by you with the other evidence
that you decide to accept.  You, of course, must reach your verdict on the whole
of the evidence that you decide is worthy of belief.""  This passage is
arguably reminiscent of the impugned two-stage instruction in Morin, but
in my view the statement here had a very different effect.  Read in isolation,
the passage may be viewed as an erroneous statement of the law: it suggests a
determination of guilt should be based solely on certain pre-selected items of
evidence.  However, when the statement is read in context I do not think that
it would have misdirected the jury.  It should be recalled that the analogous
instruction in Morin was made lockstep with the misdirection on taking a
piecemeal approach to the evidence.  By contrast, the statement here follows on
the heels of the trial judge's direction in paragraph D to consider all of the
evidence in making its determination.  A juror who had just been instructed to
corroborate the accused's statement with other evidence in the case could not
have interpreted paragraph E as invoking a two-stage process -- the two
concepts are irreconcilable.

 

                   I can deal briefly
with the remaining arguments advanced by counsel for the respondent.  First, he
submitted that MacIntosh J. neglected to explicitly instruct the jury against
taking a piecemeal approach to the evidence, thereby compounding the effect of
his misdirections.  On this point I have already cited the remarks of Sopinka
J. in Morin, at p. 362, to the effect that ""[t]he jury should be
told that the facts are not to be examined separately and in isolation with
reference to the criminal standard"", but I do not regard this as an
invariable formulation that must be invoked verbatim in every jury charge. 
Rather, it is sufficient if the charge conveys to the jury the message that
they are to consider the evidence as a whole, and not in piecemeal fashion. 
Here, the instructions of MacIntosh J. made this point very clearly, and amount
to the very direction suggested by Sopinka J.

 

                   The respondent also
contended that the ""compartmentalization"" of the jury charge
aggravated the putative error of the trial judge.  That is, by setting up a
separate segment of the charge headed ""Statements of the accused"",
the trial judge reinforced the impression that a piecemeal approach to this
evidence should be taken.  I cannot accept this argument, and I confess to
seeing no way to effectively present a four-hour jury charge other than by
compartmentalization.  Indeed, I would have thought that proper structure and
organization would only enhance the jury's understanding of the charge.

 

                   Two other points
were raised by the respondent in oral argument, both of which in my view were
effectively rebutted by the appellant in reply.  First, the respondent
contended that even a slight misdirection regarding the accused's statements
was fatal to the Crown, because it was the ""whole case"" for the
prosecution.  In reply, counsel for the appellant pointed to the array of
circumstantial evidence implicating the accused as the killer, and to the
accused's admission to William Cogger, which, if believed, tended to identify
the accused as the murderer.  Given this other evidence, it must surely be an
overstatement to say that the Crown's ""whole case"" rested on the
accused's statement to the police.

 

                   The respondent also
submitted that MacIntosh J. erred in instructing the jury, in paragraph C, that
it was for them to determine whether the statement to the police had even been
made.  The respondent contended that the voir dire, in which the
statement was found to be voluntary and thus admissible, settled the issue of
whether the statement had been made, and therefore this question should not
have been left to the jury.  To this the appellant responded by citing R. v.
Gauthier, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 441, in which this Court found that it is for the
jury, after a voir dire, to decide whether a confession had in fact been
made.  That seems to me to be a complete answer to the respondent's argument.

 

                   To summarize, none
of the three impugned passages, taken in context, were misdirections.  If I am
wrong and one or more of these passages constitutes an error of law, then I
believe that any such error was cured by the rest of the charge.  As I have
noted, the jury was instructed some fourteen times to consider the evidence as
a whole.  As well, MacIntosh J. explicitly directed the jury to evaluate the
accused's statements in light of the other evidence before them.  I cannot
believe that the solitary instructions in question, placed as they are in a sea
of contrary statements, would mislead a jury into a flawed process of
considering evidence in a piecemeal fashion.  As was stated in R. v. Demeter
(1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417, at p. 436, there will ""probably never be a
perfect charge or one that cloistered appellate counsel cannot find
objectionable after minute scrutiny.""  Simply put, the charge to the jury
must be read as a whole, bearing in mind the heavy onus that rests with the
Crown to establish that the jury's verdict may have been affected by the
impugned passage:  Vézeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  In that
light it is clear to me that MacIntosh J.'s charge, when viewed as a
whole, was not misleading to the jury.

 

The Test for Review

 

                   The appellant's
third ground of appeal is that the court below erred in holding that the jury's
verdict ""might have been different"" had it been properly instructed. 
As I understand it, counsel for the appellant makes two distinct arguments on this
ground.  First, he submits that the Appeal Division wrongly applied a relaxed
standard of review so as to effectively enable it to correct a verdict it
viewed as unreasonable.  Secondly, he contends that as a matter of logic the
jury's verdict would not have been different even if they had accepted the
accused's out-of-court statement to the police.  Given my conclusions on the
first ground of appeal, it is not strictly necessary for me to entertain the
appellant's submissions on these issues, but I will touch upon them because
they were fully argued before us.

 

                   The test for
reviewing a Crown appeal of an acquittal pursuant to s. 686(4)  of the Criminal
Code  was established by this Court in Vézeau v. The Queen, supra. 
The majority there stated the test in this way, at p. 292:

 

In
the present case, therefore, it was the duty of the Crown, in order to obtain a
new trial, to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have
been the same if the trial judge had properly directed the jury.

 

In dissent, Dickson J. appears to have
stated the test more strictly, at p. 282:

 

...
for a new trial to be ordered the Crown must satisfy the Court with a
substantial degree of certainty that the jury would necessarily have convicted
the accused in the absence of the offending words.

 

It is unclear from the judgments in Vézeau
whether anything turned on these different formulations, and I would not wish
to make too much of the point.  However, Dickson J.'s formulation would
obviously present a more difficult task for the Crown -- it would have to show
that the jury's verdict would have been different, rather than
establishing only that it may not have been the same, which is the
majority's formula.  In any event, the majority's view remains the law today, as
was made clear by Sopinka J. in Morin, at p. 374:

 

                   The
onus resting on the Crown when it appeals an acquittal was settled in Vézeau
v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277.  It is the duty of the Crown to satisfy
the court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury
had been properly instructed.

 

                   I
am prepared to accept that the onus is a heavy one and that the Crown must
satisfy the court with a reasonable degree of certainty.  An accused who has
been acquitted once should not be sent back to be tried again unless it appears
that the error at the first trial was such that there is a reasonable degree of
certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by it.  Any more
stringent test would require an appellate court to predict with certainty what
happened in the jury room.  That it cannot do.

 

The more stringent test stated by
Dickson J. has not been revived with the passage of time.

 

                   The appellant, in
oral submissions, took exception to the following passage from Chipman J.A., at
p. 110, following his conclusion that a misdirection had occurred:

 

                   Moreover,
this error was of sufficient gravity that it cannot be said that had it not
been made the result would necessarily have been the same.  Sopinka, J.,
said in Morin, supra, the charge with respect to the burden of proof
lays down for the jury one of the most fundamental rules of the game.  The
confession was undoubtedly a crucial part of the Crown's case.  Without it, the
jury could easily have formed a reasonable doubt.  With it, it is difficult to
see how a reasonable doubt as to some degree of guilt at least could be
entertained.  It can therefore be said with a reasonable degree of certainty
that the outcome may have been affected by the misdirection relating to the
confession.  The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.
[Emphasis ordered.]

 

The appellant argues that these
statements relax the burden placed on the Crown.  Counsel paraphrases the
underlined passages as requiring only that the Crown show that the verdict
""might have been different,"" suggesting that this is itself an
improper standard.  I do not agree.  A test of ""might have been
different"" seems to me to simply be the converse of ""would not
necessarily have been the same,"" and stating the proposition in this way
does not, of course, mean that the onus somehow shifts away from the Crown.  I
would note that the first of Chipman J.A.'s impugned statements is a virtual
duplicate of an alternative expression of the majority's formulation in Vézeau,
supra, at p. 291.  These statements are simply different ways of saying
the same thing.  As such, I must reject the appellant's submission that the
court below in some way misstated the standard of appellate review.

 

                   The appellant's
second argument is that the jurors had enough evidence before them to acquit
the accused even absent a reasonable doubt about the accused's out-of-court
statement.  In other words, even if the appellant's confession was believed,
other evidence at the trial was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the
minds of the jurors.  In particular, the appellant cites the flaws in the
circumstantial case presented by the Crown at trial.  The appellant argues that
the jury must have acquitted the accused because of a reasonable doubt as to
the identification of the murderer, and that this doubt could have been raised
solely by the weaknesses in the circumstantial evidence implicating the accused
in the murders.  Again, I must disagree.

 

                   Counsel's argument
betrays a certain overconfidence in the strength of his case at trial. 
Essentially, the defence argued that gunshots heard before and after the time
that the accused was with William Cogger raised a sort of alibi for the
accused.  This defence is premised on the following assumptions: that the shots
heard by Daniel Girrior emanated from the killer's gun, that the time of those
shots was accurately noted and recollected, and that William Cogger accurately
recalled the precise time he spoke with the accused during this sequence of
events.  In my view these are substantial assumptions, and I do not share the
appellant's confidence that the jury's reasonable doubt was likely derived
solely from this defence theory.  It seems more probable that the acquittal was
based on a combination of doubts with respect to both the accused's
out-of-court statement and the Crown's circumstantial evidence.  If the jury
was misled by the judge's instructions, then it is entirely possible that the
jury's verdict would have been different.  As such, the reasoning of the
majority in the court below cannot be impugned in this respect.

 

                   The appellant
(along with the Crown and the courts below) speculates as to what the jury
actually did in response to the impugned instructions from the trial judge. 
The jury deliberated for two days, but very early in their deliberations they
asked to re-hear the evidence of Daniel Girrior, William Cogger and Lorraine
Boucher.  Of course, it is impossible to know why the jury called for this evidence. 
However, their actions are at least consistent with the theory that the jurors
were doing exactly what the trial judge instructed them to do --  they were
attempting to test the veracity of the confession with independent evidence. 
The common link between the three witnesses whose testimony was replayed is
that their evidence is the basis for the defence theory that the accused could
not have fired all the shots.  Cogger's testimony places the appellant back at
his home between the groups of shots heard by Girrior, and Boucher testified
that she heard a gunshot between 3:30 and 4:00 a.m.  This evidence would have
enabled the jurors to corroborate details of the appellant's confession -- the
number of shots he fired -- with the evidence of the witnesses.  The jury might
also have been interested in the appellant's admission to Cogger that he had
killed the men.

 

                   The Crown's theory
of why the jurors asked to re-hear this evidence is that they began by
considering the confession in isolation, gave the accused the benefit of the
doubt, and accepted his explanations at trial, all within the first two hours
of their deliberations.  At this point, they would turn to the other evidence,
and would be particularly concerned with the theory of the defence.  In the
absence of the confession (which they had already rejected) the defence theory
would seem plausible, resulting in the acquittal.

 

                   As is apparent,
almost anything can be read into the chronology of the jury's deliberations. 
These theories resolve very little, and do not assist in the task of
determining whether the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the
alleged misdirection had not occurred.  For the reasons stated above, had the
judge's instructions misled the jury (which, in my view, they did not) the
resolution of this third ground would be that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same, and I would agree with the majority of the
court below on this aspect of its reasons.

 

Disposition

 

                   In the result,
because the jury charge was substantially error-free and did not mislead the
jurors, I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittal.

on appeal from court of appeal for
newfoundland

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑
Second degree murder ‑‑ Defences ‑‑ Mens rea and actus
rea ‑‑ Accused and victim intoxicated ‑‑ Accused
strangling victim but blacking out before death occurred ‑‑ Whether
subjective intent to cause bodily harm ‑‑ Whether subjective
knowledge that the bodily harm is of such a nature that it is likely to result
in death ‑‑ Whether mens rea coincided with actus rea ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 212(a)(ii).

 

                   Respondent was
convicted of second degree murder pursuant to s. 212 (a)(ii) of the Criminal
Code  ‑‑ causing bodily harm knowing it is likely to cause death
and nevertheless being reckless whether death ensues or not.  He and his victim
had been drinking.  He became angry after being hit during an argument, struck
the deceased and grabbed her by the throat with both hands and shook her. 
Respondent stated that this occurred in the front seat of the Jeep and that he
could recall nothing else until he woke in the back seat and found the body of
the deceased beside him.  He had no recollection of causing her death.  The
expert evidence established that death was caused by one‑handed manual
strangulation and that death probably occurred after two minutes of pressure. 
The Court of Appeal indicated conviction required that the accused have a
persisting or continuing knowledge that the act was likely to cause death.  It
set aside the conviction and directed that a new trial be held.  At issue here
was the nature of the intent required to found a conviction for murder pursuant
to s. 212 (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Held (Lamer C.J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka,
Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  The intent that
must be demonstrated in order to convict under s. 212 (a)(ii) has
two aspects.  There must be (a) subjective intent to cause bodily harm,
and (b) subjective knowledge that the bodily harm is of such a nature that
it is likely to result in death.  There is only a ""slight relaxation""
in the mens rea required for a conviction for murder under s. 212 (a)(ii)
as compared to s. 212 (a)(i).

 

                   Mens rea must not only be present but also
must be concurrent with the impugned act.  It is not always necessary, however,
for the guilty act and the intent to be completely concurrent; they need only
coincide at some point.  An act (actus reus) which may be innocent or no
more than careless at the outset can become criminal at a later stage when the
accused acquires knowledge of the nature of the act and still refuses to change
his or her course of action.  The determination of whether the mens rea
coincides with the wrongful act depends to a large extent upon the nature of
the act.

 

                   To obtain a
conviction the Crown had to demonstrate that the accused intended to cause
bodily harm that he knew was ultimately so dangerous and serious that it was
likely to result in the death of the victim.  But that intent did not need to
persist throughout the entire act of strangulation.  The jury could infer that
respondent, by seizing the victim by the neck, intended to cause her bodily harm
that he knew that was likely to cause her death.  The jury could reasonably
infer that the actus reus and mens rea coincided at the moment
when the accused grabbed the victim by the neck and shook her ‑‑
the necessary coincidence of the wrongful act of strangulation and the
requisite intent to do bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to cause
her death.  Respondent was aware of these acts before he ""blacked
out"".  It was not necessary that the requisite intent continue throughout
the entire time required to cause the death of the victim.  If death results
from a series of wrongful acts that are part of a single transaction then it
must be established that the requisite intent coincided at some point with the
wrongful acts.

 

                   Looking at the
charge as a whole, the jurors would adequately understand the issues involved,
the law relating to the charge the accused faced, and the evidence to be
considered in resolving the issues.  Directions to the jury need not, as a
general rule, be endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and
criticism.  Rather the charge must be read as a whole.  The directions to the
jury must, of course, set out the positions of the Crown and defence, the legal
issues involved and the evidence that may be applied in resolving the legal
issues and ultimately in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. 
The trial judge repeatedly and adequately instructed the jury about the
consequences of respondent's consumption of alcohol, about the capacity to form
the required intent, and assuming capacity, about the need for that intent in
the circumstances.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. (dissenting):  The
jury must understand that there must be intention to cause bodily harm which
the accused knows is likely to cause death for there to be a correct charge
under s. 212 (a)(ii).  The charge must make it clear that intention
to cause bodily harm, without knowledge that such is likely to cause death, is
not sufficient.  Upon examination of the charge as a whole, this was not done
adequately.

 

                   Intentionally and
consciously choking someone for only a few seconds might or might not
constitute the infliction of bodily harm within the meaning of s. 212 (a)(ii). 
While ""bodily harm"" is not defined in that section, the definition in
s. 245.1 ‑‑ any hurt or injury to the complainant that
interferes with his or her health or comfort and that is more than merely
transient or trifling in nature ‑‑ provides some general guidance
about its interpretation in s. 212 (a)(ii) and makes the point that
bodily harm includes a broad spectrum of hurts and injuries.

 

                   Intention to cause
bodily harm does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the accused knew
that the bodily harm was likely to cause death.  This second aspect is
essential to a finding of guilt of murder under s. 212 (a)(ii). 
Particularly with respect to an action such as grabbing by the neck, there may
be a point at the outset when there is no intention to cause death and no
knowledge that the action is likely to cause death.  But there comes a point in
time when the wrongful conduct becomes likely to cause death.  At that moment
or thereafter, the accused must have a conscious awareness of the likelihood of
death.  This awareness need not continue until death ensues.

//Lamer C.J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. ‑‑ I
have read the reasons of my colleague, Justice Cory, and adopt his exposition
of the facts, the law and, save what is hereinafter said, his comments with
respect to s. 212(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34 (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , s. 229 (a)(ii)).

 

                   It is crucial to a
correct charge under s. 212(a)(ii) that the jury understand that
there must be intention to cause bodily harm which the accused knows is likely
to cause death.  Intention to cause bodily harm, without knowledge that such is
likely to cause death, is not sufficient.  Given the position of the defence in
this case, a clear understanding of this aspect was essential to a fair trial.

 

                   Intentionally and
consciously choking someone for only a few seconds might or might not
constitute the infliction of bodily harm within the meaning of s. 212(a)(ii). 
While the term ""bodily harm"" is not defined in that section, there is
a statutory definition in s. 245.1 (now s. 267 ) which also applies to
ss. 245.3 (now s. 269 ) and 246.2 (now s. 272 ):

 

                   245.1

 

                   (2)
. . . ""bodily harm"" means any hurt or injury to the
complainant that interferes with his or her health or comfort and that is more
than merely transient or trifling in nature.

 

                   This definition
provides some general guidance about the interpretation of the term
""bodily harm"" in s. 212(a)(ii) and makes the point that
bodily harm includes a broad spectrum of hurts and injuries.

 

                   I do not raise this
point to question whether the accused here intended to cause bodily harm.  That
was conceded in the argument before us.  I raise it rather to emphasize that
the intention to cause bodily harm by no means leads inexorably to the
conclusion that the accused knew that the bodily harm was likely to cause
death.  It is, of course, this second aspect which is essential to a finding of
guilt of murder under s. 212(a)(ii).  Particularly with respect to
an action such as grabbing by the neck, there may be a point at the outset when
there is no intention to cause death and no knowledge that the action is likely
to cause death.  But there comes a point in time when the wrongful conduct
becomes likely to cause death.  It is, in my view, at that moment or
thereafter, that the accused must have a conscious awareness of the likelihood
of death.  This awareness need not, however, continue until death ensues.

 

                   Cooper intended to
choke the deceased and cause her bodily harm.  Under s. 212(a)(i),
it was open to the jury to infer from his conduct and on all of the evidence
that in doing so he intended to kill her.  To be found guilty under s. 212(a)(ii),
however, he must have been aware of the fact that he persisted in choking her
long enough for it to become likely that death would ensue.

 

                   This instruction,
given the particular facts of this case and the nature of the defence presented
by the accused, had to be given.  Additionally, the jury should have been
instructed to consider the evidence of drunkenness in relation to this
awareness.  In my respectful view, upon a reading of the whole charge, this was
not done adequately.

 

                   I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.
was delivered by

 

                   Cory J.    ‑‑ At issue, on this
appeal, is the nature of the intent required to found a conviction for murder
pursuant to s. 212(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34, (now R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 229 (a)(ii)).

 

Factual Background

 

                   The respondent
Lyndon Cooper and the deceased Deborah Careen lived in Labrador City,
Newfoundland.  At one time, they had been friends and lovers.  On January 30,
1988, they met at a gathering place known as the K-Bar in Labrador City. 
Although by this time, the respondent was living with somebody else, they spent
the evening together at the bar.  There is no doubt that they consumed a
considerable amount of alcohol.  Eventually, Cooper, the deceased and a mutual
friend left the bar in a taxi.  After they dropped off the friend they
continued in the cab to the residence of another of Cooper's friends where he
borrowed a Jeep.  Cooper then drove the deceased to the secluded parking lot of
a power station.

 

                   At the parking lot
the respondent testified that he and the deceased engaged in some form of
consensual sexual activity.  He said that they began to argue at one point and
that the deceased struck him.  At this he became angry.  He hit the deceased
and grabbed her by the throat with both hands and shook her.  He stated that
this occurred in the front seat of the Jeep.  He then said that he could recall
nothing else until he woke in the back seat and found the body of the deceased
beside him.  He had no recollection of causing her death.  He pushed her body
out of the Jeep and drove away.  Later during the drive to his home he found
one of her shoes in the vehicle and threw it out the window into the snow.

 

                   The expert evidence
established that the deceased had in fact been struck twice.  However, these
blows could not have killed her.  Rather death was caused by ""a classic
pattern of one-handed manual strangulation"".  That same evidence confirmed
that death by strangulation can occur as quickly as 30 seconds after contact
with the throat and that a drunken victim is likely to die from asphyxiation more
quickly than a sober one.  Nonetheless, the presence of petechial haemorrhages
on the neck of the deceased and the finding that the hyoid bone in her throat
was not fractured suggested to the expert that death occurred rather more
slowly, probably after two minutes of pressure.

 

                   The position of the
defence was that the respondent was so drunk that he blacked out shortly after
he started shaking her with both hands.  Thus, it was said that the respondent
did not have (i) the required intent to commit murder, or (ii) alternatively
did not foresee that holding someone by the neck was likely to cause death.

 

Courts Below

 

                   Newfoundland
Supreme Court

 

                   O'Regan J.
withdrew the first degree murder charge from the jury.  He left open to them
three possible verdicts; not guilty, guilty of second degree murder or guilty
of manslaughter.  He explained that s. 212 (a)(ii) of the Criminal
Code  dealt with those situations where an accused intended to cause bodily
harm knowing that it was likely to cause death.  At one point, the jury asked
for further instruction with regard to the difference between second degree
murder and manslaughter.  O'Regan J. advised that once the accused had
formed the intent to cause her bodily harm which he knew would likely
cause her death, he need not be aware of what he was doing at the moment she
actually died.  The jury convicted the respondent of second degree murder.

 

                   Newfoundland Court
of Appeal (1991), 89
Nfld. &  P.E.I.R. 1

 

                   The Court of Appeal
concluded that the trial judge dealt quite properly with the issue of
intoxication and adequately reviewed the evidence during the course of his
charge to the jury.  However, Gushue J.A., writing on behalf of the court,
held that the trial judge had not adequately explained the intent required for
murder.  He expressed the view that the trial judge had not complied with the
reasons of this Court given in R. v. Nygaard, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1074. 
Gushue J.A. put his position in this way at p. 5:

 

                   Further,
was it established beyond a reasonable doubt that he ""persist(ed) in that
conduct despite the knowledge of the risk"".  While from the
forensic evidence it appears the appellant persisted in his conduct, was
continuing awareness on his part of what he was doing and its probable result
established?  [Emphasis in original.]

 

He concluded that:

 

A
simple reading of what the Supreme Court said in this regard in Nygaard
makes it very clear that an extremely high degree of knowledge by an accused of
what he is doing and persisting in must be demonstrated before the requisite
intent may be found to exist.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
set aside the conviction and directed that a new trial be held.

 

Analysis

 

The Nature of the Intent Required to
Secure a Conviction Under s. 212(a)(ii).

 

Section 212(a)(ii)
provides:

 

212.  Culpable homicide is
murder

 

(a)  where
the person who causes the death of a human being

 

                                                                   . . .

 

(ii)  means
to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, and is
reckless whether death ensues or not;

 

                   This section was
considered in R. v. Nygaard, supra.  On the issue of the
requisite intent the Court was unanimous.  At pages 1087-88, it was said:

 

The
essential element is that of intending to cause bodily harm of such a grave and
serious nature that the accused knew that it was likely to result in death of
the victim.  The aspect of recklessness is almost an afterthought
. . .

 

                   The aspect of
recklessness can be considered an afterthought since to secure a conviction
under this section it must be established that the accused had the intent to
cause such grievous bodily harm that he knew it was likely to cause death.  One
who causes bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death must, in those
circumstances, have a deliberate disregard for the fatal consequences which are
known to be likely to occur.  That is to say he must, of necessity, be reckless
whether death ensues or not.

 

                   The concept of recklessness
was considered by this Court in Sansregret v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
570.  At page 582 it was said

 

[Recklessness]
is found in the attitude of one who, aware that there is danger that his
conduct could bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law,
nevertheless persists, despite the risk.  It is, in other words, the conduct of
one who sees the risk and who takes the chance.

 

                   The same words can
apply to s. 212(a)(ii) with this important addition:  it is not
sufficient that the accused foresee simply a danger of death, the
accused must foresee a likelihood of death flowing from the bodily harm
that he is occasioning the victim.

 

                   It is for this
reason that it was said in Nygaard that there is only a ""slight
relaxation"" in the mens rea required for a conviction for murder
under s. 212(a)(ii) as compared to s. 212(a)(i).  The
position was put in this way at p. 1089:

 

. . .
[where] two accused form the intent to repeatedly and viciously strike a person
in the head with a baseball bat realizing full well that the victim will
probably die as a result.  Nonetheless they continue with the bone-splintering,
skull-shattering assault.  The accused . . . must have committed as
grave a crime as the accused who specifically intends to kill . . . I
would conclude that the crime defined in s. 212(a)(ii) [now 229(a)(ii)]
can properly be described as murder and on a ""culpability scale"" it
varies so little from s. 212(a)(i) as to be indistinguishable

 

                   The intent that
must be demonstrated in order to convict under s. 212(a)(ii) has
two aspects.  There must be (a) subjective intent to cause bodily harm; (b)
subjective knowledge that the bodily harm is of such a nature that it is likely
to result in death.  It is only when those two elements of intent are established
that a conviction can properly follow.

 

What Degree of Concurrency is Required
Between the Wrongful Act and the Requisite Mens Rea?

 

                   There can be no
doubt that under the classical approach to criminal law it is the intent of the
accused that makes the wrongful act illegal.  It is that intent which brings
the accused within the sphere of blameworthiness and justifies the penalty or
punishment which is imposed upon him for the infraction of the criminal law. 
The essential aspect of mens rea and the absolute necessity that it be
present in the case of murder was emphasized by Lamer J. (as he then was)
in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  At p. 653 he stated:

 

It
may well be that, as a general rule, the principles of fundamental justice
require proof of a subjective mens rea with respect to the prohibited
act, in order to avoid punishing the ""morally innocent"".

 

                   The essential
element of a subjectively guilty mind in order to convict a person of murder
was again emphasized in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.

 

                   However, not only
must the guilty mind, intent or mens rea be present,  it must also be
concurrent with the impugned act.  Professor D. Stuart has referred to this as
""the simultaneous principle"":  see Canadian Criminal Law (2nd
ed. 1987), at p. 305.  The principle has been stressed in a number of
cases.  For example in R. v. Droste (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 52 (Ont.
C.A.), the accused had intended to murder his wife by pouring gasoline over the
interior of the car and setting fire to it while she was within it.  Before he
could light the gasoline the car crashed into a bridge and ignited
prematurely.  As a result both his children were killed rather than his wife. 
He was charged with their murder and convicted.  On appeal Arnup J.A., speaking
for the Court of Appeal in directing a new trial, stated at pp. 53‑54:

 

. . .
the trial Judge did not instruct the jury of the necessity of the Crown showing
that at the time of the occurrence at the bridge, the appellant, intending to
kill his wife, had done an act with that intention, and in the course of doing
so his children were killed.  In short, he did not tell them that the mens
rea and the actus reus must be concurrent . . . .
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   Yet, it is not
always necessary for the guilty act and the intent to be completely
concurrent.  See for example Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner,
[1968] 3 All E.R. 442 (Q.B.).  In that case a motorist stopped his car on the
foot of a police officer.  This was apparently done by accident.  When the
officer, not unreasonably, asked the accused to move the car, he at first
refused but eventually did move on.  It was determined that while the first
action of stopping was innocent of criminal intent, it acquired the necessary mens
rea when the accused was made aware that the car was resting on the
officer's foot and still refused to move.  James J. concurring in the
result stated at p. 445:

 

It
is not necessary that mens rea should be present at the inception of the actus
reus; it can be superimposed on an existing act.

 

                   There is, then, the
classic rule that at some point the actus reus and the mens reas
or intent must coincide.  Further, I would agree with the conclusion of
James J. that an act (actus reus) which may be innocent or no more
than careless at the outset can become criminal at a later stage when the
accused acquires knowledge of the nature of the act and still refuses to change
his course of action.

 

                   The determination
of whether the guilty mind or mens rea coincides with the wrongful act
will depend to a large extent upon the nature of the act.  For example, if the
accused shot the victim in the head or stabbed the victim in the chest with
death ensuing a few minutes after the shooting or stabbing, then it would be
relatively easy to infer that the requisite intent or mens rea coincided
with the wrongful act (actus reus) of shooting or stabbing.  As well, a
series of acts may form part of the same transaction.  For example the repeated
blows of the baseball bat continuing over several minutes are all part of the
same transaction.  In those circumstances if the requisite intent coincides at
any time with the sequence of blows then that could be sufficient to found a
conviction.

 

                   An example of a
series of acts that might be termed a continuous transaction appears in Meli
v. The Queen, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 228 (P.C.).  There the accused intended to kill
the deceased, and to this end struck a number of blows.  The effect of the
blows was such that the accused thought the victim was dead and threw the body
over a cliff.  However, it was not the blows but rather the exposure suffered
by the victim while he lay at the base of the cliff that resulted in the
death.  It was argued on behalf of the accused that when there was the
requisite mens rea (during the beating) death did not ensue and when
death did ensue there was no longer any intention to kill.  The Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council concluded that the entire episode was one
continuing transaction that could not be subdivided in that way.  At some
point, the requisite mens rea coincided with the continuing series of
wrongful acts that constituted the transaction.  As a result, the conviction
for murder was sustained.  I agree with that conclusion.

 

Application of the
""Contemporaneous"" Principles to This Case

 

                   Gushue J.A.
indicated that persisting or continuing knowledge by the accused that the act
he was performing was likely to cause death was required in order to obtain a
conviction.  He wrote at p. 5:

 

A
simple reading of what the Supreme Court said in this regard in Nygaard
makes it very clear that an extremely high degree of knowledge by an accused of
what he is doing and persisting in must be demonstrated before the
requisite intent may be found to exist.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   Yet, with respect,
I do not think that it is always necessary that the requisite mens rea
(the guilty mind, intent or awareness) should continue throughout the
commission of the wrongful act.  There is no question that in order to obtain a
conviction the Crown must demonstrate that the accused intended to cause bodily
harm that he knew was ultimately so dangerous and serious that it was likely to
result in the death of the victim.  But that intent need not persist throughout
the entire act of strangulation.  When Cooper testified that he seized the
victim by the neck, it was open to the jury to infer that by those actions he
intended to cause her bodily harm that he knew that was likely to cause her
death.  Since breathing is essential to life, it would be reasonable to infer
the accused knew that strangulation was likely to result in death.  I would
stress that the jury was, of course, not required to make such an inference
but, on the evidence presented, it was open to them to do so.

 

                   Did the accused
possess such a mental state after he started strangling the victim?  Here death
occurred between 30 seconds and 2 minutes after he grabbed her by the neck.  It
could be reasonably inferred by the jury that, when the accused grabbed the
victim by the neck and shook her, there was, at that moment, the necessary
coincidence of the wrongful act of strangulation and the requisite intent to do
bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to cause her death.  Cooper was
aware of these acts before he ""blacked out"".  Thus although the jury
was under no compulsion to do so, it was nonetheless open to them to infer that
he knew that he was causing bodily harm and knew that it was so dangerous to
the victim that it was likely to cause her death.  It was sufficient that the
intent and the act of strangulation coincided at some point.  It was not
necessary that the requisite intent continue throughout the entire two minutes
required to cause the death of the victim.

 

                   Gushue J.A. in
his reasons relied upon and stressed the following quotation from R. v.
Nygaard, supra, at p. 1088

 

Thus
the section requires the accused to intend to cause the gravest of bodily harm
that is so dangerous and serious that he knows it is likely to result in death
and to persist in that conduct despite the knowledge of the risk. 
[Emphasis added.]

 

                   The emphasized
words refer to the conduct of an accused.  Those words should not be
taken as requiring a persistent or continued awareness of a likelihood
of death right up to the moment of death or until the precise moment when it is
established that death was likely to occur.  Once it is demonstrated beyond a
reasonable doubt that an accused has knowingly caused bodily harm that he knew
was likely to cause the death of the victim and the victim dies as a result of
the injuries inflicted, then he may be found guilty of murder under
s. 212(a)(ii).

 

                   The Court of Appeal
asked, at p. 5, whether ""continuing awareness on his part of what he
was doing and its probable result [was] established"".  The accused argued
that in using this expression the Court of Appeal was not going so far as to
require the presence of a continuous intent up to the moment of death.  Rather,
he contended that the court was merely stating that in order for there to be a
conviction under this section the mens rea must be present at or after
the point at which it becomes likely the death will ensue.  It was his position
that if the intent to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to
cause death should disappear before the point was reached at which death became
likely then the accused could not be found guilty.  He stated that it was only
at this point that the mens reas and actus reus could coalesce
into the crime described in s. 212(a)(ii).

 

                   This argument
should not be accepted.  It would require the Crown to provide expert evidence
as to the moment at which death physiologically became a likelihood.  It would
be impossible to fix the time of the ""likelihood"" of death and
difficult to provide evidence as to the duration of the requisite intent of the
accused.  That cannot be the meaning of this section.  Neither the plain
wording of this section nor any concept of fairness require the Crown to
demonstrate such a complex chronological sequence.  In order to obtain a
conviction under s. 212(a)(ii) the Crown must prove that the
accused caused and intended to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause the death of the victim.  If death results from a series of wrongful acts
that are part of a single transaction then it must be established that the
requisite intent coincided at some point with the wrongful acts.

 

                   On this issue the
trial judge correctly instructed the jury when he stated:

 

When
he grabbed her by the neck and shook her, did he intend to cause her bodily
harm, which he knew was likely to cause her death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not.  In other words, he wouldn't have to be there until she
died . . . . He could formulate all of that intent at that point in
time, even th[o]ugh he doesn't remember the final outcome.

 

                   It was on this
ground that the Court of Appeal directed the new trial.  Although it can never
be determinative of the issue, it is significant that defence counsel at trial
took no objection to this or any other aspect of the charge.  In any event for
the reasons set out earlier, I must disagree with the Court of Appeal's
conclusion on this issue.  A new trial should not have been granted on this
ground.

 

The Knowledge of the Likelihood of
Death

 

                   The appellant seeks
to uphold the order directing a new trial on two other grounds.  The first, and
the more important of these, is the issue raised before the Court of Appeal
that the trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury that the Crown must
establish that Cooper knew that the bodily injury that he was inflicting
was likely to cause the death of the victim.  I cannot agree with that
contention.

 

                   It is true that
from one or two excerpts from the charge the jury could have inferred that an
intent to cause bodily harm was all that was required in order to convict.  Yet
on numerous occasions the trial judge stated and repeated that the jurors had
to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Cooper meant to cause bodily
harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not.  If there was any question as to the adequacy of the
charge it was put to rest by the trial judge's reply to a question from the
jury enquiring as to the difference between second degree murder and
manslaughter.  At that time, when the jury's mind was focused upon this very
issue, the trial judge adequately instructed the jury as to the intent the
Crown was required to establish in order to convict under s. 212(a)(i)
or 212(a)(ii).

 

                   The following
portions of the response to the question are significant.

 

The
things that you have to remember, we need, in order to have anything, we need
an unlawful act.  I said I don't think you will have any difficulty in finding
an unlawful act.  The unlawful act has to be done by the accused and there has
to be a deceased.  So, take that out, let's assume we have an unlawful act. 
Then you have murder, second-degree murder if the accused, the person who did
it, means to cause death or means to cause bodily harm that he knows is likely
to cause death and is reckless whether death ensures or not.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Not
only do you need intention, but you need the capability of forming the intent. 
You have to be capable of intending.  This is where drunkenness comes in,
whether or not he was capable of forming the intent.  Even if he is capable for
forming the intent, he has to intend it.  The intent of a person can come from
his actions, or from what he says.  You can infer certain intention, but you
always have to give the doubt to the accused.  Now, in relation to intention,
the Crown has to prove the intention beyond a reasonable doubt.  And the onus
is on the Crown to do that and it never shifts.  Manslaughter, the second one,
doesn't require intention.  Manslaughter only requires the unlawful act and
there is no intention necessary.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

Two
things we need for intent is we need the capability of forming the intent.  It
has to be a specific intent.  You know, a person has to say, I intend,
subjectively.  And, you have to be capable of doing that.  Drunkenness can
reduce that capability.  But even if a person was drunk, they could still be
capable of intending their actions, but you still have to find that he intended
the actions.  Capability plus intent.  But, even if there is no intent and no
capability, and you find by the unlawful act that the deceased died, which was
the grabbing, then it is manslaughter.  So, for murder it is the intent, but
you have to remember capability as well.

 

                   When the charge is
looked at as a whole, there can be no doubt that the jury understood what was
required in order to convict under s. 212(a)(ii).  It has been said
before but it bears repeating that it would be difficult if not impossible to
find a perfect charge.  Directions to the jury need not, as a general rule, be
endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and criticism.  Rather the
charge must be read as a whole.  The directions to the jury must, of course,
set out the position of the Crown and defence, the legal issues involved and
the evidence that may be applied in resolving the legal issues and ultimately
in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.  At the end of the day,
the question must be whether an appellate court is satisfied that the jurors
would adequately understand the issues involved, the law relating to the charge
the accused is facing, and the evidence they should consider in resolving the
issues.  I am satisfied that in this case the charge meets all these basic
requirements.  Particularly, the law pertaining to the legal issues was
correctly placed before the jury.  Any errors were immediately and repeatedly
corrected.

 

                   The respondent also
contended that the trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury with regard
to the consequences of the consumption of alcohol by Cooper.  I agree with the
Court of Appeal that the respondent has no grounds for complaint on this
issue.  The trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that if they were not
satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the capacity to form the
requisite intent as a result of consumption of alcohol that they were to
acquit.  He went on to advise the jury that even if the accused had the
capability to form the intent, they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that he did in fact have the requisite intent and that in determining
that issue, they could take into account the alcohol that had been consumed. 
In light of those instructions, there is no basis for this complaint.

 

                   There is a
difference of opinion among appellate courts as to the effect of evidence as to
intoxication.  In R. v. MacKinlay (1986), 28 C.C.C. (3d) 306 (Ont.
C.A.), Martin J.A. held that evidence of intoxication which did not
deprive the accused of the capacity to form the intent should still be taken
into consideration in determining whether the accused did in fact form the
requisite intent to commit the offence.  In R. v. Korzepa (1991), 64
C.C.C. (3d) 489, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected the MacKinlay
decision.  It was suggested that the reasoning of Martin J.A. was contrary to
decisions of this Court.  This is an issue that has not as yet been addressed. 
It would be inappropriate to do so in this case, as its validity was not raised
or addressed before us.  For the purpose of this case it is enough to note that
the respondent had the benefit of a charge that was the most favourable to his
position.  As a result, the respondent cannot complain of the directions of the
trial judge on this issue.

 

                   Upon a careful
reading and review of the charge as a whole, I am satisfied that there were no
errors committed by the trial judge that would justify a new trial.

 

                   In the result, I
would set aside the order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial and
restore the conviction.

                   Respondent, a
family physician, was charged with 14 counts of sexual assault involving seven female
patients who had attended at his office for medical treatment and diagnosis. 
Each had consented to being touched for valid medical reasons in intimate areas
of her body.

 

                   Prior to trial,
respondent applied for an order that each count be tried separately or
alternatively that the counts be severed by complainant.  The judge hearing the
motion (not the trial judge) ordered that three different trials be held
depending on the part of the complainant's body involved in the assault ‑‑
genitalia, breasts or other matters.  The counts therefore were not only
severed but also divided such that separate trials were to be held for events
that occurred within one visit to the respondent's office by the same
complainant.

 

                   In a trial by judge
alone, the Crown first proceeded on those counts relating to vaginal
examinations.  The trial judge refused the Crown's motion to hold a voir
dire to determine the admissibility of the evidence relating to the severed
counts and ruled that the Crown could proceed by calling all of the evidence
relating to the severed counts, subject to a subsequent ruling on
admissibility.  The Crown called all of the evidence relating to the severed
counts, as well as the evidence of the complainants in the trial going to the
counts before the court and the evidence of two medical experts.  The trial
judge, on a voir dire, refused to admit the evidence of several other
women of similar assaults by the respondent.  He also refused to admit the
testimony of the respondent's ranking medical officer as to counselling the
respondent had received from her after complaints were lodged against him while
he practised in the military.  The trial judge subsequently ruled all the
evidence relating to the severed counts inadmissible as irrelevant or, even if
relevant, too prejudicial.  The respondent successfully brought a motion for a
non‑suit at the close of the Crown's case and was acquitted.  The Court
of Appeal dismissed the Crown's appeal.  At issue here were:  (1) whether
this Court had jurisdiction to review a pre‑trial severance order, and
(2) if so, whether the pre‑trial severance order should be set
aside; (3) whether any of the evidence excluded at trial should have been
admitted; and (4) whether a non‑suit should have been granted.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.

 

                   Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.: Sexual assault is a crime of
general intent.  The Crown need not prove a specific intent with respect to the
sexual nature of the assault because it forms part of the actus reus. 
The test is therefore an objective one.  All the circumstances surrounding the
conduct in question will be relevant to the question of whether the touching
was of a sexual nature and violated the complainant's sexual integrity.  Courts
in individual cases should not create unnecessary barriers to considering all
the circumstances surrounding conduct alleged to constitute a sexual assault,
particularly where the complainant has consented to some touching but not to
touching of a sexual nature.  The nature of a complainant's relationship to her
alleged assaulter, including the patient's lack of power and knowledge and the
doctor's duty to perform medical examinations only for the patient's good, must
all figure in a determination of whether the patient in fact consented to the
conduct in question.

 

                   At first blush, the
pre‑trial severance order could not be appealed as part of the
respondent's acquittal without violating the rule against collateral attack:  a
court order, made by a court having jurisdiction to make it, may not be
attacked in proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal,
variation, or nullification of the order or the judgment.  Given a strict
application of the rule, the trial judge would not have had the power to review
the division and severance order because the specific object of the proceedings
was not its reversal, variation or nullification.  Consequently, there would
have been no error of law committed with respect to proceeding on the division
and severance order at the trial upon which an appeal of the verdict reached
during the trial could be founded.  The result would be that neither the Court
of Appeal nor this Court would have jurisdiction to review, much less to set
aside, the division and severance order.

 

                   The rule against
collateral attack should not be strictly applied here.  The rule was not
intended to immunize court orders from review but to maintain the rule of law
and to preserve the repute of the administration of justice.  The principles
based on certainty and on the need for the orderly and functional
administration of justice which lie behind the rule against collateral attack
are not applicable in the case of a pre‑trial division and severance
order. Such an order does not govern the conduct of the parties but rather
regulates the judicial process itself.  Allowing  a collateral attack at trial
on such an order would not jeopardize the rule of law or damage the repute of
the administration of justice.  Indeed the order would have been subject to review
by appellate courts along with the verdict if it had been made by a trial
judge.  Procedure cannot govern substance ‑‑ an order so erroneous
that it results in a fundamentally flawed trial process cannot be allowed to
stand.

 

                   The pre‑trial
division and severance order could be reviewed by the trial judge and set aside
if in error.  The trial judge's failure to refuse to follow the pre‑trial
division and severance order, if erroneous, would constitute an error of law
reviewable on appeal to this Court.

 

                   An indictment is
preferred only when it is lodged with the trial judge.  An accused need not
wait until the actual trial date to bring an application to divide or sever
counts.  The indictment can be preferred once the trial judge has been assigned
and a severance application can be brought after the indictment has been
preferred but before the court has been constituted to begin hearing evidence. 
As a matter of practice and policy, the trial judge should hear applications to
divide and sever counts.  Such orders are not immunized from review and
needless duplication is avoided.

 

                   The division or
severance of a count requires the exercise of a great deal of discretion given
the breadth of the criteria governing division and severance ‑‑ the
court must be satisfied that the ends of justice require the order.  An
appellate court should not interfere with the exercise of this discretion
unless it is shown that the issuing judge acted unjudicially or that the ruling
resulted in an injustice.  The order at issue here worked an injustice towards
the Crown, the complainants and the administration of justice in that it placed
an artificial barrier to the trial judge's ability to consider the respondent's
conduct in all the circumstances.  The order had to be set aside given its
jurisdictional and substantive flaws and given the trial judge's errors in
applying it.

 

                   All the evidence by
the complainants going to the severed counts should have been admitted with
respect to all the counts before the trial judge.  It was relevant to several
important issues and its prejudicial effect would not outweigh its probative
value.  The evidence of other touching, while it might be characterized as
similar acts, was not tendered solely to show that the respondent was a person of
bad character or of a disposition likely to commit the offences, but rather to
provide information highly relevant to understanding the context in which the
offences occurred.  This evidence was admissible.  The trial judge did not
weigh the probative value of the evidence or specify its prejudicial effects.

 

                   The evidence of the
respondent's superior officer from his time of military practice was relevant
to the nature and quality of the acts which respondent performed on the
complainants and specifically to whether he was carrying out proper medical
procedures.  The hearsay rule was wrongly applied here to exclude the
evidence.  This evidence was not hearsay.  

 

                   The admissibility
of other evidence excluded by the trial judge should be left to the discretion
of the trial judge in the new trial.

 

                   The motion for non‑suit
should not have been granted because there was admissible evidence which, if
believed by a properly charged jury acting reasonably, would justify
conviction.  Here, the trial judge made the determination on the application
for a non‑suit in his capacity as trial judge and not as trier of fact
because he made no determinations of weight and credibility prior to reaching
his decision.  Other errors made over the course of the trial judge's ruling
also made it impossible for the order to stand.  Even with the trial judge's
rulings on the admissibility of evidence, there was some evidence, both direct
and circumstantial, which, if believed by a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably, could have resulted in convictions.  Under a correct approach to
the admissibility of the evidence, there would have been all the more evidence
to satisfy the standard.

 

                   Per McLachlin J.:  In Alberta, it
appears to be standard practice to arraign an accused before the trial for the
purposes of taking pleas and pre-trial orders.  This procedure allows severance
motions to be heard prior to trial without seizing the chambers judge of the
matter.  The indictment is preferred and trial proceedings begin upon arraignment
even though that may be months before a judge and jury are empanelled.  The
suggestion in R. v. Chabot that the indictment is not preferred until it
is presented in the presence of the accused before a trial court constituted to
dispose of the case, does not apply to pre‑trial arraignments in
Alberta.  The rule against collateral attack would present no difficulty in
cases like this one because the severance order is part of the trial
proceedings.  As such, it was appealable.  In the alternative, if the order
were taken to have preceded the preferment of the indictment and not to be part
of the trial, there should be an exception to the rule against collateral
attack where the Alberta procedure has been followed.

                   Iacobucci
J. -- There are several
issues in this appeal.  First, does this Court have jurisdiction to review a
pre-trial order dividing and severing counts in an indictment?  Second, if so,
should the order in this case be set aside?  The third issue in this appeal
concerns the admissibility of the testimony of various witnesses.  Finally, did
the trial judge err in granting the respondent's motion for a non-suit and
entering acquittals?

 

I.  Facts

 

                   The respondent was
a family physician practising in Edmonton.  The respondent was charged with 14
counts of sexual assault involving seven complainants who were his patients at
all relevant times.  The assaults were alleged to have occurred while the complainants
attended at the respondent's office for medical treatment and diagnosis.  Each
of the complainants consented to being touched in intimate areas of her body
but that consent was predicated upon the touching being carried out for valid
medical purposes.

 

                   Prior to trial, the
respondent applied for an order that each of the counts alleged against him be
tried separately.  He requested in the alternative that the counts be severed
by complainant.  McDonald J., who was not the trial judge, heard the application. 
He did not order a separate trial for each count, but instead ordered that
three different trials be held depending on the part of the complainant's body
that was involved in the assault.  McDonald J. ordered one trial for
allegations involving the complainants' genitalia, a second trial for
allegations concerning the complainants' breasts, and a third trial for any
other matters.  This resulted in an order that not only severed but also
divided counts, such that separate trials were to be held for events that
occurred within one visit to the respondent's office by the same complainant.

 

                   The respondent
elected to be tried by judge alone.  The Crown proceeded to trial first on
those counts relating to vaginal examinations (nine counts in total), and
sought to have the admissibility of the evidence relating to the severed counts
determined at a voir dire at the outset of the trial.  Hope J., the
trial judge, refused to hold a voir dire and ruled that the Crown could
proceed by calling all of the evidence relating to the severed counts, subject
to a subsequent ruling on admissibility.  The Crown called all of the evidence
relating to the severed counts, as well as the evidence of the complainants in
the trial going to the counts before the court and the evidence of two medical
experts.  After a voir dire during the trial, the trial judge admitted
the evidence of the police officer who testified to the respondent's statement
to the police.  After another voir dire, the trial judge refused to
admit the evidence of several other women who stated on the voir dire
that they had experienced similar assaults by the respondent.  He also refused
to admit the testimony of the respondent's ranking medical officer as to
counselling the respondent had received from her after complaints were lodged
against the respondent while he practised in the military.  The trial judge
subsequently ruled all the evidence relating to the severed counts inadmissible
as irrelevant or, even if relevant, too prejudicial.

 

                   At the
close of the Crown's case, the respondent brought a motion for a non-suit.  The
trial judge granted the application and the respondent was acquitted.  The
Crown's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (1992), 120 A.R. 391, and
this Court granted leave to appeal.

IV. Analysis

 

                   Before directly
discussing the issues raised in this appeal, I think it is important to keep in
mind the nature of the offence of sexual assault as well as the specific
manifestation of the alleged sexual assaults in a doctor-patient relationship.

 

                   The sexual
aspect of a sexual assault forms part of the actus reus; there is no
requirement that a person accused of sexual assault have any mens rea
with respect to the sexual nature of a sexual assault.  This was the holding of
this Court in R. v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293, which decided that
sexual assault is a crime of general intent and that the Crown did not have to
prove a specific intent with respect to the sexual nature of the assault.  As
McIntyre J. wrote for the Court at p. 302:

 

The
intent or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent that this may
appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering whether the
conduct is sexual....  It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of
such a motive is simply one of many factors to be considered, the importance of
which will vary depending on the circumstances.

 

                   The
test to be applied in determining whether an accused's conduct had the
requisite nature to constitute a sexual assault is therefore an objective one. 
As this Court indicated in Chase, all the circumstances surrounding the
conduct in question will be relevant to the question of whether the touching
was of a sexual nature and violated the complainant's sexual integrity.  It is
therefore important in individual cases that courts not create unnecessary
barriers to considering all the circumstances surrounding conduct which is
alleged to constitute a sexual assault.  This is particularly true where the
complainant has consented to some touching but not to touching of a sexual
nature:  in such a case, the court must have at its disposal as much relevant
information as possible in order to determine whether the conduct was of a
nature to which the complainant did not consent.

 

                   The importance of
looking to all the circumstances surrounding an accused's impugned conduct is
thrown into relief by a case such as that under consideration in this appeal,
where a doctor-patient relationship is concerned.  Certainly, medical evidence
will be important to assessing the nature of an accused physician's conduct. 
However, when determining whether a complainant in fact consented to that which
occurred, courts must also ensure that they neither ignore the testimony of a
patient who complains of sexual assault nor underestimate the position of
vulnerability in which a patient often finds herself when she is in the care of
a professional medical doctor.  All of the opinions in the judgment of this
Court in Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226, recognized the
imbalance of power that may occur between a doctor and a patient where an
alleged sexual assault is concerned.

 

                   La Forest J.
(Gonthier and Cory JJ. concurring) stated at p. 258:  ""An unequal
distribution of power is frequently a part of the doctor-patient
relationship"".  McLachlin J., who also wrote for L'Heureux-Dubé J.,
focused on the fiduciary nature of the doctor-patient relationship and wrote at
p. 272:

 

I
think it is readily apparent that the doctor-patient relationship shares the
peculiar hallmark of the fiduciary relationship -- trust, the trust of a person
with inferior power that another person who has assumed superior power and
responsibility will exercise that power for his or her good and only for his or
her good and in his or her best interests.

 

Thus the nature of a
complainant's relationship to her alleged assaulter, including the patient's
lack of power and knowledge as well as the doctor's duty to perform medical
examinations only for the good of the patient and in the patient's best
interest, must be kept in mind when determining whether the patient in fact
consented to the conduct in question.  As Sopinka J. wrote in Norberg at
p. 304 in the context of tortious sexual battery:

 

                   In
assessing the reality of consent and the existence and impact of any of the
factors that tend to negate true consent, it is important to take a
contextually sensitive approach.  In relation to medical procedures, several
courts have emphasized the need to consider all relevant surrounding
circumstances in assessing whether there was valid consent....

 

Certain
relationships, especially those in which there is a significant imbalance in
power or those involving a high degree of trust and confidence may require the
trier of fact to be particularly careful in assessing the reality of consent.

 

                   With these
considerations in mind, I now turn to the issues in this case.

 

1.Does
this Court have jurisdiction to review a pre-trial division and severance order?

 

                   As an introductory
matter, McDonald J. should have noted that he was not only severing the
existing counts in the indictment but was also dividing the counts.  The
indictment against the respondent contained 14 counts, each of which related to
one entire visit by the relevant complainant to the respondent's office.  For example,
count 13 alleged that the respondent committed a sexual assault on one
complainant on July 28, 1989.  The complainant's testimony about that visit
referred to both a breast examination and a vaginal examination.  McDonald J.
ordered that count 13 should be tried in one trial as far as the breast
examination was concerned, and that count 13 should be tried in another trial
as far as the internal examination was concerned.  In proceeding as he did,
McDonald J. divided some of the counts and then severed the divided counts. 
However, he made no reference in his ruling to dividing the counts, which a
court is enabled to do under s. 590(3) of the Code, and the indictment
was never amended to reflect the division.  As I mentioned above, the
respondent did not request this particular order, but rather brought an
application seeking separate trials for each count or, alternatively, for each
complainant.

 

                   When
it appealed the respondent's acquittals, the Crown sought to have the division
and severance order set aside.  The respondent submitted before this Court that
the division and severance order was the result of an interlocutory motion from
which no appeal lies.  Appeals in the criminal context are entirely statutory
and the Code contains no provision for immediate appeal from an
interlocutory order.  See, e.g., Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
863, at p. 959, where McIntyre J. stated for the majority:

 

It
has long been a settled principle that all criminal appeals are statutory and
that there should be no interlocutory appeals in criminal matters....  It will
be observed that interlocutory appeals are not authorized in the Code.

 

It is not disputed that
the Crown could not have appealed the division and severance order prior to the
trial.  However, the question in this appeal is whether the Crown can appeal
the division and severance order as part of its appeal of the respondent's
acquittal.

 

                   The answer to this
question is not straightforward.  The division and severance order in this case
was not made by the trial judge.  It was made by a superior court judge on a
motion brought prior to the trial.  At first blush, the order cannot be
appealed as part of the respondent's acquittal without violating the rule
against collateral attack.  This rule holds that ""a court order, made by a
court having jurisdiction to make it,"" may not be attacked ""in
proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation,
or nullification of the order or judgment"" (Wilson v. The Queen,
[1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, per McIntyre J., at p. 599).  The lack of
jurisdiction which would oust the rule against collateral attack would be a
lack of capacity in the court to make the type of order in question, such as a
provincial court without the power to issue injunctions.  However, where a
judge, sitting as a member of a court having the capacity to make the relevant
type of order, erroneously exercises that jurisdiction, the rule against
collateral attack applies.  See, e.g., B.C. (A.G.) v. Mount Currie Indian
Band (1991), 54 B.C.L.R. (2d) 129 (S.C.), at p. 141, and R. v. Pastro
(1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 485 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 498-99, per Bayda
C.J.S.  Such an order is binding and conclusive until set aside on appeal.

 

                   The rule against
collateral attack has been re-affirmed by this Court on numerous occasions,
such as in R. v. Meltzer, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1764, R. v. Garofoli,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, and Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, per McLachlin J. at p. 973, citing R. J. Sharpe, Injunctions
and Specific Performance (1983).

 

                   The
respondent's trial would not have been a proceeding in which the specific
object was the reversal, variation or nullification of the division and
severance order.  Therefore, under a strict application of the rule against
collateral attack, the trial judge would have had no power to review the
division and severance order.  Consequently, there would have been no error of
law committed with respect to proceeding on the division and severance order at
the trial upon which an appeal of the verdict reached during the trial could be
founded.  The result would be that neither the Court of Appeal nor this Court
would have jurisdiction to review, much less to set aside, the division and
severance order.

 

                   In my opinion,
however, this is not the case for a strict application of the rule against
collateral attack which was not intended to immunize court orders from review. 
The rationale behind the rule is powerful:  the rule seeks to maintain the rule
of law and to preserve the repute of the administration of justice.  To allow
parties to govern their affairs according to their perception of matters such
as the jurisdiction of the court issuing the order would result in
uncertainty.  Further, ""the orderly and functional administration of
justice"" requires that court orders be considered final and binding unless
they are reversed on appeal (R. v. Pastro, supra, at p. 497). 
However, these principles behind the rule against collateral attack are not
applicable in the case of a pre-trial division and severance order.

 

                   A pre-trial
division and severance order does not govern the conduct of the parties but
rather regulates the judicial process itself.  Such an order is purely related
to the procedure of an accused's trial.  Another way of stating the matter is
that a pre-trial division and severance order is only concerned with a court's
controlling its own process within the confines of the same litigation. 
Therefore, to allow a collateral attack at trial before a superior court on a
pre-trial division and severance order made by a superior court would not
jeopardize the rule of law or damage the repute of the administration of
justice.  Further, if the order had been made by a trial judge, it would have
been subject to review by appellate courts along with the verdict.  To permit
an order to stand which is so erroneous that it results in a trial process that
is fundamentally flawed would  result in procedure governing substance; a
result that cannot be accepted. 

 

                   Accordingly, in the
narrow circumstances of this case, I would recognize some flexibility in the
rule against collateral attack and hold that the pre-trial division and
severance order was liable to be reviewed and, if made erroneously, set aside
by the trial judge.  The failure of the trial judge to refuse to follow the
pre-trial division and severance order, if erroneous, would constitute an error
of law reviewable on appeal to this Court.

 

                   As the next portion
of my reasons will show, there should be little occasion for this exception to
the rule against collateral attack to be applied in the future since I am of
the opinion that only the trial judge ever has jurisdiction to issue a division
and severance order.

 

2. Should the division
and severance order be set aside?

 

                   The division and
severance order is anomalous in that severance orders are usually made by the
trial judge, in which case the order would be appealable as part of the
verdict.  Indeed, for the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that no one
but the trial judge has jurisdiction to issue a severance order.

 

                   Logically,
an accused cannot bring a motion to quash an indictment, or to divide or sever
counts in an indictment, until the indictment has been preferred.  Until the
indictment has been preferred, it does not exist as against the accused, is not
legally effectual, and therefore is not subject to being altered or quashed.

 

                   That motions
respecting the indictment can only be brought once the indictment is preferred
was recognized by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in R. v. Deol, Gill and
Randev (1979), 20 A.R. 595.  The same conclusion was reached by the Prince
Edward Island Supreme Court in R. v. Martel (1986), 63 Nfld. &
P.E.I.R. 39.  See also Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (5th ed.
1989), at p. 189:

 

                   Once
an indictment is preferred, the defence is entitled to bring an application
to quash that indictment for a defect of substance or form.  Similar
applications may be brought for particulars of the indictment, to sever the counts
in the indictment or to sever the trial of accused who are jointly charged.
[Emphasis added.]

 

Statements to the same effect have
been made by this Court.  For example, in R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
985, Dickson J., as he then was, stated for the Court at p. 990:  ""After
presentment of the indictment, the accused is free to move to quash the
indictment by motion made in the trial court....""  Similarly, in R. v.
Barbeau, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 845, Cory J. wrote for the Court at p. 856: 
""After the preferment of the indictment for sexual assault, defence
counsel could have challenged... this indictment"".

 

                   The next question
to ask is when is an indictment preferred against an accused.  In Chabot,
this Court held that an indictment is preferred only when it is lodged with the
trial court properly constituted and ready to proceed, at the opening of the
accused's trial.  Dickson J. held for the Court as follows at p. 999:

 

...
I would hold that an indictment based upon a committal for trial without the
intervention of a grand jury is not ""preferred"" against an accused
until it is lodged with the trial court at the opening of the accused's trial,
with a court ready to proceed with the trial.

 

                   According to the Chabot
test, the indictment against the respondent was not preferred until it was
lodged with Hope J. at the opening of the respondent's trial.  Therefore,
McDonald J. had no jurisdiction to divide or sever the counts since the
indictment had not been preferred against the respondent at the time of the
application.  A further conclusion is that no one except the trial judge ever
has jurisdiction to divide or sever counts since an indictment is only
preferred at the opening of an accused's trial.

 

                   This does not mean
that an accused must wait until the actual trial date to bring an application
to divide or sever counts.  Once a trial judge has been assigned to the matter,
the indictment can be preferred against the accused by lodging it with the trial
judge.  Since Chabot, the Code has been amended such that in jury
trials the trial judge need not be ready to proceed with the trial to deal with
matters such as the validity of the indictment.  Subsection 645(5) of the Code
provides:

 

                          645. ...

                   (5)
In any case to be tried with a jury, the judge before whom an accused is or is
to be tried has jurisdiction, before any juror on a panel of jurors is called
pursuant to subsection 631(3) and in the absence of any such juror, to deal
with any matter that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the
absence of the jury after it has been sworn.

 

                   Thus, under s.
645(5) , the trial judge can deal with matters concerning the indictment prior
to the selection and calling of a jury, in the case of a jury trial.  It was
always open to a trial judge in the case of a trial by judge alone to hear
pre-trial motions before preparing to hear evidence.  The judge hearing the
application for severance of counts in an indictment would either have to have
been assigned as the trial judge or else would be seized of the trial upon the
preferring of the indictment and the subsequent hearing of the severance
application.

 

                   The statement in s.
591(4) of the Code that a severance order may be made ""before
or during the trial"" (emphasis added) is not deprived of its meaning under
this approach to jurisdiction.  A severance application brought after the
indictment is preferred but before the court is constituted to begin hearing
evidence would be brought before the trial.

 

                   Moreover, as a
matter of practice and policy, it is obviously preferable that the trial judge
hear applications to divide and sever counts so that such orders are not
immunized from review.  Otherwise, procedure begins to govern substance. 
Indeed, it makes sense that the trial judge consider applications to divide and
sever counts since an order for division or severance of counts will dictate
the course of the trial itself.  Courts have recognized that it is preferable
that trial judges make division and severance orders (see, e.g., R. v.
Watson (1979), 12 C.R. (3d) 259 (B.C.S.C.), and R. v. Auld (1957),
26 C.R. 266 (B.C.C.A.)).  Not only are trial judges better situated to assess
the impact of the requested severance on the conduct of the trial, but limiting
severance orders to trial judges avoids the duplication of efforts to become
familiar enough with the case to determine whether or not a severance order is
in the interests of justice.  It seems desirable, therefore, that in the future
only trial judges can make orders for division or severance of counts in order
to avoid injustices such as occurred in this case.

 

                   Even had McDonald
J.'s order been solid on jurisdictional grounds, I would be inclined to set it
aside.  The criteria for when a count should be divided or a severance granted
are contained in ss. 590(3) and 591(3) of the Code.  These criteria are
very broad:  the court must be satisfied that the ends or interests of justice
require the order in question.  Therefore, in the absence of stricter
guidelines, making an order for the division or severance of counts requires
the exercise of a great deal of discretion on the part of the issuing judge. 
The decisions of provincial appellate courts have held, and I agree, that an
appellate court should not interfere with the issuing judge's exercise of
discretion unless it is shown that the issuing judge acted unjudicially or that
the ruling resulted in an injustice.  See, for example, R. v. Kestenberg and
McPherson (1959), 126 C.C.C. 387 (Ont. C.A.), in which Porter C.J.O.
stated, at p. 392, with regard to the trial judge's refusal to order a
severance:

 

Unless
it is shown that he acted unjudicially in the exercise of his discretion or
that an injustice might have resulted from the joint trial, his decision should
not be disturbed....

 

                   McDonald
J.'s order for division and severance resulted in an injustice in this case
when it divided and severed the counts based on the body parts of the
complainants.  This arbitrary distinction greatly amplified the difficulties in
assessing the alleged sexual assaults in the context of all of the
circumstances surrounding the conduct by creating an evidentiary problem which
would not have existed but for the order.  With respect, the order reveals a misapprehension
about the nature of the offence of sexual assault and the considerations that
go into assessing if a particular procedure alleged to be medically proper and
necessary constitutes a sexual assault.

 

                   McDonald J. held
that proof that the respondent had performed one act (such as a breast
examination) on the complainant which was not for the purposes of treatment or
diagnosis would have no probative value with regard to whether or not another
act (such as a vaginal examination) performed by the respondent on the
complainant was for the purposes of treatment or diagnosis.  In so holding,
McDonald J. was in error.  As stated above, this Court emphasized in Chase
that the court must look to all the circumstances surrounding the conduct in
determining the nature and quality of the act.  For example, if the respondent
acted improperly towards a complainant during one part of a physical
examination, evidence of that improper conduct would be relevant to assessing
the respondent's conduct at other times during the examination.

 

                   The practical
effect of McDonald J.'s order for division and severance was to create an
unnecessary evidentiary problem by rendering evidence about one part of one
visit to the respondent potentially inadmissible as regards another part of the
same visit to the respondent's office since different parts of the same visit
to the respondent would be contained in separate counts.  McDonald J.'s
discussion of the irrelevance and lack of probative value of the evidence of
one type of act (breast examinations) to another type of act (internal
examinations) was referred to directly by Hope J. in his decision to declare
the evidence going to the severed counts inadmissible.  As I will discuss
below, the decision to exclude the evidence going to the severed counts was in
error and prejudiced the Crown in its ability to make out its case.  The
division and severance order worked an injustice towards the Crown, the
complainants and the administration of justice in that it placed an artificial
barrier to the trial judge's ability to consider the respondent's conduct in
all the circumstances.

 

                   I do
not wish to leave this matter without making one final comment on McDonald J.'s
severance order.  The order denies the reality of how the complainants experienced
the conduct which they have alleged constituted sexual assaults.  Each aspect
of one complainant's contact with the respondent interlocks with all the other
aspects to form the larger context within which that complainant felt that the
respondent's actions were inappropriate.  Further, the message that a division
and severance order in a sexual assault case based on the complainant's body
parts sends to women is that the complainant's physical attributes are more
important than her experience as a whole person.  The order severed the
complainants as well as the counts.  In my opinion, the message sent by the
order, although not intended to have this effect and although not amounting to
an error of law, is inappropriate.

 

                   Given
these jurisdictional and substantive flaws in McDonald J.'s order for division
and severance of the counts, and that it was an error for Hope J. to apply the
order, it must be set aside.

 

3. Should any of the evidence
excluded by the trial judge have been admitted?

 

(a) 
Evidence going to the severed counts

 

                   As I stated above,
Hope J. was in error to exclude the evidence going to the severed counts.  Hope
J. declared that the evidence of the complainants going to the severed counts
was generally inadmissible as irrelevant or, in the alternative, too
prejudicial.  He ruled as follows:

 

                   Having
regard to the severance order of Justice McDonald, which in effect has said
there is to be for trial purposes at least two trials, based upon the sections
of the body, I am unable to say that I can find relevancy of evidence which I
would expect to come from complainants in the second trial to the counts in
this trial.  In the event that I am in error, I would not admit that evidence
since, in my opinion, the prejudicial effect of admission of such evidence
would be greater than its probative value.

 

With respect, I disagree.

 

                   The counts should
not have been divided so as to separate a breast examination from a vaginal
examination or any other type of touching that occurred during a single visit
to the respondent.  However, even with the counts divided as they were, there
should have been no question as to the admissibility of the evidence of other
touching that occurred during the same appointment with the respondent as the
vaginal examination being considered by the trial judge, or of evidence given
by one complainant about other visits she had with the respondent.

 

                   The
evidence of one complainant about one visit to the respondent is simply
evidence of the events surrounding the alleged sexual assault.  This evidence
raises no similar fact or similar act evidence considerations and was clearly
relevant.  The trial judge did not determine the probative value of the
evidence, specify its prejudicial effect, or weigh one against the other.  I am
of the opinion that the evidence regarding acts other than vaginal examinations
was not prejudicial at all where the evidence of one complainant with respect
to her experience with the respondent is concerned since it is simply evidence
about the nature of the complainant's professional relationship with the
respondent.  On the other hand, that evidence if accepted by a trier of fact
would be probative of the circumstances in which the internal examinations
occurred which in turn would be probative of the nature of the respondent's
conduct.  In my opinion, the prejudicial effect of the evidence would not
outweigh its probative value.  Accordingly, evidence given by one complainant
about events that occurred during the same visit to the respondent's office as
the vaginal examination forming the subject of the count before the trial judge
would be admissible as against that count.  The trial judge erred in excluding
this evidence.

 

                   For the same
reasons, evidence given by one complainant about other appointments she had
with the respondent was also properly admissible as against the counts before
the trial judge in which the complainant was named.

 

                   I am also of the
opinion that the evidence of one complainant as regards the severed counts
should have been admitted with respect to the counts relating to each of the
other complainants.  While this evidence could be characterized as evidence of
similar acts or events, the evidence was not tendered solely to show that the
respondent was a person of bad character or of a disposition likely to commit
the alleged offences.  Rather, the evidence provided information highly
relevant to understanding the context in which the alleged offences occurred
and shed light on the nature of the respondent's relationship with his
patients, particularly the standard of medical treatment he provided.  The
evidence provided a different perspective on the alleged assaults from that
afforded by the medical evidence.  The evidence going to the severed counts, if
accepted by a jury, would also tend to show a distinct pattern of behaviour
engaged in by the respondent.  While the probative value of one complainant's
evidence with respect to other complainants' allegations is somewhat less than
that described above, and the prejudicial effect higher, I would nonetheless
find that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect.

 

                   In summary, all the
evidence going to the severed counts should have been admitted with respect to
all the counts before the trial judge.  This evidence was relevant to several
important issues in the case, and its prejudicial effect would not outweigh its
probative value.

 

(b) 
Evidence of the respondent's ranking medical officer

 

                   Hope J. ruled that
the evidence of the respondent's ranking medical officer, Colonel MacKenzie,
who was qualified as an expert in the field of the general practice of
medicine, was inadmissible on the basis that it is irrelevant since it
""only tells us what she advised the accused do to improve his practice at
an army station some seven years ago"". 

 

                   I disagree with
Hope J. that this evidence was irrelevant.  The substance of the Colonel's
evidence was that, in response to complaints made against the respondent by
female patients while he was practising medicine in the military, she
counselled the respondent on the proper way to conduct a medical practice. 
Among the suggestions she gave the respondent were that he should have a female
medical personnel present in the office when he did any intimate examinations
and that he should be careful about how he touched patients.  He was also
counselled to stop spending unduly long amounts of time with his patients, and
not to invade patients' privacy by watching them undress and dress.  In my
opinion, this evidence was very relevant to the nature and quality of the acts
which the respondent performed on the complainants and specifically to whether
or not he was carrying out proper medical procedures.  Further, one of the
respondent's defences was that of good faith even if his practices were
unorthodox.  The Colonel's evidence would go to rebutting this defence since an
inference could be drawn that the respondent had been made aware of problems
with his practice in this respect.  Hope J. was therefore in error to reject
this evidence on the basis of irrelevance.  The Colonel's testimony should have
been admitted.

 

                   Hope J. also
rejected the Colonel's evidence on the basis of a rule which he described as
follows:

 

[Her evidence] may well be inadmissible under the
rule that in the absence of any assent by the accused, either by word or
conduct, to the correctness of the statements made in his presence, has no
evidentiary value and should be disregarded.

 

Whether or not the respondent accepted
or rejected the advice has no bearing on the admissibility of what the Colonel
told the respondent.  The rule on which Hope J. relied actually relates to the
admissibility of hearsay statements, made in the presence of an accused
and adopted by the accused as an admission.  For example, the leading case in
the area concerned the admissibility of a mother's testimony about accusations
made against the accused, and in the presence of the accused, by her young son
(R. v. Christie, [1914] A.C. 545 (H.L.)).  The Colonel's testimony was
not hearsay since it was not evidence, presented for the truth of the matter
stated, of what someone else told her.  Therefore, the rule to which Hope J.
referred has no application in this case.

 

(c) 
Evidence of non-complainants

 

                   On a voir
dire, the Crown called five women who had been patients of the respondent
in the army as well as three women, also past patients, who had come forward
with complaints about the accused after the preliminary inquiry as a result of
media reports regarding the charges against the respondent.  These women all
testified that they felt the respondent had acted inappropriately towards them
during medical examinations, including breast and vaginal examinations.  Hope
J. ruled that all of this evidence was inadmissible.

 

                   Given the errors
already committed in the severance order, in the exclusion of other evidence,
and in the motion for a directed verdict (which I will discuss below), I do not
think it is necessary to discuss the admissibility of this evidence and will
leave it to the discretion of the trial judge in the respondent's new trial. 
Recognizing that this evidence can correctly be characterized as similar fact
evidence, it will be for the trial judge to consider whether or not the
evidence falls within the decision of this Court in R. v. C. (M.H.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 763.                 

 

                   Another factor for
the trial judge to consider will be the availability of medical records
regarding the witnesses from the army.  The trial judge may decide that the
lack of medical records for these witnesses' visits with the respondent renders
the prejudicial  effect of the evidence too high for it to be admissible.

 

                   Before
leaving this evidence, I would note that Hope J. approached the decision
regarding the admissibility of this evidence improperly when he assessed the
witnesses' credibility and made determinations as to the weight he would give
their evidence.  The credibility of witnesses and weight to be given evidence
are matters to be considered by the trier of fact when making a determination
as to a verdict after the Crown and the defence have presented their cases and
are not factors properly before a trial judge when ruling on the admissibility
of evidence.

 

4.  Did the trial judge err in
granting the respondent's motion for a non-suit?

 

                   I am of the opinion
that Hope J. erred in granting the respondent's motion for a non-suit at the
close of the Crown's case.  An application for a directed verdict or a non-suit
is a matter of common law since there is no provision in the Code for
such an application.  This Court reviewed the test to be applied on such an application
in R. v. Monteleone, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 154.  In that case, McIntyre J.
wrote for the Court that the test to be applied is derived from the decision in
United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067.  That test
(at p. 161) is whether there is ""any admissible evidence, whether direct
or circumstantial, which, if believed by a properly charged jury acting
reasonably, would justify a conviction"".  McIntyre J. stated at p. 161:

 

It
is not the function of the trial judge to weigh the evidence, to test its
quality or reliability once a determination of its admissibility has been
made.  It is not for the trial judge to draw inferences of fact from the
evidence before him.  These functions are for the trier of fact, the jury.

 

                   The respondent elected
to be tried without a jury, and therefore Hope J. was to fulfil the roles of
both trial judge and trier of fact.  It was in his role as trial judge, rather
than as trier of fact, that he was to make a determination on the application
for a non-suit.  Hope J. was not to make determinations of weight and
credibility prior to reaching a decision on the application for a non-suit.

 

                   The trial judge
opened his ruling on the application by stating the correct test.  He held:

 

...
counsel for the accused applied for a directed verdict.  That is, there is no
case to answer on the basis that there has been no evidence to prove an
essential ingredient or element of the offence, or, put another way, there is
no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably might
convict the accused.  In deciding this application, I do not weigh the
evidence.

 

                   Despite
articulating the correct standard at the outset, Hope J. began to commit errors
over the course of his ruling on the motion.  First, he stated that in relation
to consent, the Crown had ""to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the
procedures carried out were not appropriate or necessary for diagnostic or
treatment purposes"".  There are two errors in this statement.  First,
proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not an element of the test for a directed
verdict; the proper test is some evidence.  Second, the Crown did not have to
submit evidence proving that the procedures were not appropriate or necessary
for diagnostic or treatment purposes.  What the Crown had to lead was evidence
that the conduct of the respondent had a sexual character in addition to
whatever medical character that conduct might have had.

 

                   Hope
J. next erred when he stated that the only evidence going to show whether or
not there was a lack of consent was that of the two medical experts.  The
evidence of the medical experts produced opinions on the necessity of and the
proper procedures for the types of medical examinations in question.  However,
the testimony of the complainants as to their feelings of specific distress and
discomfort, as well as their testimony that they had never had similar
experiences with other doctors, was evidence going to lack of consent.  The
complainants' testimony also afforded evidence that the respondent's practices
varied from visit to visit, or from complainant to complainant, which might
tend to throw doubt on the nature of the touching.  Further, the investigating
officer testified that the respondent had stated that he was
""probably"" sexually aroused by one of the complainants.  The police
officer also testified that when he was read part of one of the complainant's
statement to police, the respondent stated something like, ""I'm human, I
need to stop here. ...  That is going to happen every so often"".  This supported
that complainant's testimony that the respondent apologized to her after the
alleged sexual assault, saying something like, ""... I'm sorry.  I got
carried away [involved],"" and ""... at least I know I'm human"". 
Therefore, there was admissible evidence aside from that of the medical experts
going to the issue of lack of consent.

 

                   Next, in my
opinion, Hope J. broadly overstated the matter when he stated that both medical
experts approved the respondent's procedures.  The doctors' testimony was long and
complex, and contained many statements from which a jury could have concluded
that the respondent's conduct was inappropriate in terms of accepted medical
practice.  It was for the trier of fact to weigh the experts' evidence and
reach a conclusion about the inferences to be drawn from that evidence.  It was
not the function of the trial judge on a motion for a non-suit to do so.

 

                   I note also that it
was no barrier to the reception of the evidence that the experts testified on
occasion to their own practices.  There is no rule of evidence that experts may
not testify as to their own practices (see, for example, the sections on expert
opinion evidence in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in
Canada (1992), at pp. 533-74, and McWilliams, Canadian Criminal Evidence
(3rd ed. 1993), at pp. 9-9 to 9-45).  Deyong v. Weeks (1983), 43 A.R.
342 (C.A.), on which Hope J. relied for his ruling, was a civil case concerning
expert opinion evidence regarding the proper standard of care to be expected of
the profession in a suit for professional negligence and was therefore inapplicable. 
Finally, at the point when Hope J. was considering the motion for the non-suit,
the expert evidence has already been admitted.  It was improper for Hope J. to
make statements on the admissibility of the expert evidence after the close of
the Crown's case.

 

                   As I have stated,
along with weighing the evidence and drawing inferences from some witnesses'
testimony, Hope J. erroneously applied a ""proof beyond a reasonable
doubt"" as opposed to a ""some evidence"" standard, an error which
he made explicit by concluding, ""the Crown has failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt an essential ingredient in each of the counts"".  His
errors were not cured by the statement at the end of his judgment that there
was ""no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
might convict the accused"".  Indeed, the fact that Hope J. left out a key
part of the test, i.e., no evidence which if believed could form the
basis for a conviction, indicates that he directed a verdict based on his
disbelief of the evidence rather than on a neutral assessment.

 

                   Given these errors,
the order for the non-suit cannot stand.  Even under the trial judge's rulings
on the admissibility of evidence, there was some evidence, both direct and
circumstantial, which if believed by a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could have resulted in convictions.  Under a correct approach to the
admissibility of the evidence, there would have been all the more evidence to
satisfy the standard.

 

V.  Conclusion and Disposition

 

                   The pre-trial order
for division and severance of the counts contained apparent flaws in
jurisdiction and in substance, and in the circumstances should not have been
applied by the trial judge.  Further, the trial judge erred in his rulings on
the admissibility of the evidence going to the severed counts, as well as the
testimony of the respondent's ranking medical officer.  Finally, the trial
judge erred in granting the non-suit.  Accordingly, the matter must go back for
a new trial.

 

                   For the foregoing
reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order dividing and severing
the counts, set aside the acquittals, and order a new trial.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   McLachlin
J. -- I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of Justice Iacobucci and agree with them.  I
wish only to add a comment on the question of whether this Court has
jurisdiction to review the order for severance made by McDonald J. in chambers.

 

                   The problem, it is
said, is that the order in question was not made by the trial judge as part of
the trial.  It was made prior to the trial by McDonald J.  This Court, in R.
v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, commented in obiter dicta at p. 1000
that the preferral of the indictment occurs and the trial begins when the
accused is called upon to plead ""before a trial court constituted to
dispose of the case"".  In the case at bar, that occurred only sometime
after McDonald J. had made his severance order.  Had the judge who presided
over the trial proper, Hope J., made the severance order, as happens elsewhere
in some parts of Canada, it would have been appealable as part of the
proceedings in the trial.  The difficulty is that the order was made before
trial by another judge before, it is argued, the indictment was preferred. 
Since no appeal was (or could be) taken from that order, it stands, by virtue
of the rule against collateral attack: See Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2
S.C.R. 594.  My colleague concludes that to meet this argument, it is necessary
to entertain an exception to the rule against collateral attack so that
substance may triumph over form.

 

                   It has been
questioned, however, whether Chabot, which says the indictment is
preferred and the trial begins when the court is ready to hear the case,
applies in Alberta.  It appears that in that province, it is standard practice
to arraign an accused before the trial for purposes of taking pleas and
pre-trial orders.  It has been held that under this Alberta procedure, the
indictment must be regarded as having been preferred before the trial begins. 
In R. v. Brackenbury and Pratt (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Alta.
Q.B.),   Cavanagh J. considered the effect of Chabot on Alberta criminal
procedure.  He determined that Chabot is inapplicable in Alberta as it
is based, first, upon practice in provinces which had previously used a system
of grand juries and, second, primarily upon Ontario practice which is
considerably different than that in Alberta.

 

                   After discussing
the historical basis for the decision in Chabot, Cavanagh J. briefly
outlines at p. 11 the practice in Ontario upon which the decision was based:

 

                   The
Ontario practice seems to be that some time shortly after the preliminary
hearing, an agent of the Attorney-General signs and files an indictment with
the Clerk of the Superior Court.  That is step No. 1.  It appears that the
cause then goes to an Assignment Court at which time a trial date is fixed.  It
appears that there is no reading of the indictment and indeed it is not clear
that the accused must be present.  That is step No. 2.  Step No. 3 in Ontario
appears to be the trial, which is commenced by a presentation of the indictment
to the Court, acceptance of it, reading of it to the accused, and upon his
pleading not guilty commencement of the trial itself with a Judge and jury.

 

                   He then discusses
the practice in Alberta at pp. 11-12.

 

                   The
Alberta practice is as follows: step No. 1 -- some time shortly after the
completion of the preliminary inquiry, an agent of the Attorney-General signs
and files an indictment with the Clerk of the Queen's Bench.  Step No. 2 --
arraignment.  At or after committal the accused is notified of the date he is
to be arraigned in Court [sic] of Queen's Bench. . . . All accused to be
arraigned appear on that day before a Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. 
There is no jury.  The indictment is presented to the presiding Judge who
causes it to be read to the accused, and if the accused pleads not guilty, a
trial date usually four to six months later is fixed.  If the accused objects
to the indictment then no plea is taken, the matter is adjourned to the next
arraignment date on the understanding that the objection will be heard by a
Judge and ruled upon before the next arraignments.  If at arraignments the
accused pleads guilty, the presiding Judge will sentence him.

 

                   It
should be noted that if it is said that the indictment is not preferred against
the accused at arraignments, then those who plead guilty and are sentenced
would have to be convicted without an indictment ever having been preferred
against them.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

                   Procedure in
Alberta allows severance motions to be heard by judges in chambers prior to
trial without seizing the judge of the matter:  R. v. Deol, Gill and
Randev (1979), 20 A.R. 595.  This procedure, as well as others such as the
taking of guilty pleas on arraignment, appears to be premised on the assumption
that the indictment is preferred against the accused and trial proceedings
begin upon arraignment, even though that may be months before a judge and jury
are empanelled.  If one applies Chabot literally to the Alberta
practice, many problems arise, including the one we face in this appeal.

                   

                   One way to meet the
problem is to state, as Cavanagh J. did in Brackenbury and Pratt, supra,
at p. 10, that the suggestion in Chabot that the indictment is not
preferred until it is presented in the presence of the accused ""before a
court constituted to dispose of the case"", does not apply to pre-trial
arraignments in Alberta.  On this view, the trial begins for purposes of plea
and appeal at arraignment, even though a judge and jury ready to hear the case
are not in place.  The rule against collateral attack would present no
difficulty in cases like this one, since the severance order is part of the
trial proceedings.  In my view, this makes sense.  Chabot was predicated
on the procedure in Ontario.  It should not be applied literally to different
procedures in different provinces when to do so results in anomaly and
injustice.

 

                   Historically and
linguistically, there is no reason why an indictment could not be preferred
prior to the time when the court is fully constituted to dispose of the
matter.  As Cavanagh J. points out in Brackenbury and Pratt, at p. 10:

 

 

The
English word ""To prefer"" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary 
as follows: ""To lay (a matter) before anyone formally for consideration,
approval, or sanction; to bring forward, present, submit (a statement, bill,
indictment, information, prayer, etc.)"". In the French version the verb
used is ""presenter"".  This word incorporates a similar idea of
placing something before a Court for consideration and action.... [T]he
indictment is presented to the Court, the Court accepts or rejects it; if it is
accepted, as is usually the case, it is read to the accused and he is called upon
to plead to it.  That, in my view, completes preferment.

 

The preferment was historically
effected when a bill of indictment was presented to and returned by a grand
jury.  This typically occurred at the point when the judge and jury were in
place, ready to hear the case, as described in Chabot.  In provinces such
as Alberta, where there have never been grand juries, it is done by the
Attorney General or his or her agent: see Salhany, Canadian Criminal
Procedure (1989), at p. 182.  This has often occurred prior to the time
when a judge and jury ready to hear the evidence were in place.  In short, the
time when the indictment is preferred and the trial proceedings begin is a
matter of historical incident and practice, rather than one of principle.

 

                   Viewing the matter
thus, I incline to the view that the order of McDonald J. occurred after
preferment of the indictment and commencement of the trial proceedings and
should be regarded as part of the trial.  As such, it is appealable.  In the
alternative, if I were to proceed from the premise that the order of McDonald J.
preceded the preferment of the indictment and was not part of the trial, I
agree with my colleague that there should be an exception to the rule against
collateral attack where the Alberta procedure outlined above has been
followed.  To do otherwise would be to insulate severance orders by Alberta
courts against appeals which could be brought in other parts of the country
where the judge who actually presides at the trial makes the order.  That would
be manifestly unjust.

 

                   Whatever approach
is adopted, I agree that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal
from the severance order of McDonald J.  

 

                   I would dispose of
the appeal as proposed by Iacobucci J.

                   The accused was
charged with sexual assault alleged to have taken place between September 1985
and March 1988.  Following a medical examination of the complainant, a 9‑year‑old
girl, the police began their investigation in May 1988 and a videotaped
interview of the complainant took place in August 1988.  At the preliminary
inquiry, the complainant testified before the court.  At trial, the Crown
sought to introduce the videotaped interview of the complainant pursuant to
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code .  That section provides that in any
proceeding relating to certain sexual offences ""in which the complainant
was under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence is alleged to have
been committed, a videotape made within a reasonable time after the alleged
offence, in which the complainant describes the acts complained of, is
admissible in evidence if the complainant, while testifying, adopts the
contents of the videotape"".  The accused sought a declaration that
s. 715.1  was unconstitutional but the trial judge upheld the section. 
Following a voir dire, the videotaped interview was admitted into
evidence and the accused was convicted.  The Court of Appeal allowed the
accused's appeal and declared s. 715.1  unconstitutional.  The court held
that s. 715.1  contravened ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and could not be sustained under s. 1 . 
A new trial was ordered.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be
allowed.  Section 715.1 of the Code is constitutional.

 

                   Per Lamer C.J. and La Forest,
Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ.:  Section 715.1 of the Code
is a response to the dominance and power which adults, by virtue of their age,
have over children.  By allowing for the videotaping of evidence under certain
express conditions, s. 715.1  not only makes participation in the criminal
justice system less stressful and traumatic for child and adolescent
complainants, but also aids in the preservation of evidence and the discovery
of truth.

 

                   Section 715.1  does
not infringe s. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter . 
Section 715.1  does not offend the rules of evidence against the admission
of hearsay evidence and prior consistent statements.  In addition, as there is
no constitutionally protected requirement that cross‑examination be
contemporaneous with the giving of evidence, the accused's right to cross‑examine
has not been violated.  The admission of the videotaped evidence does not make
the trial unfair or not public, nor does it in any way affect an accused's
right to be presumed innocent.  Moreover, the incorporation of judicial
discretion into s. 715.1 , which permits a trial judge to edit or refuse to
admit videotaped evidence where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative
value, ensures that s. 715.1  is consistent with fundamental principles of
justice and the right to a fair trial protected by s. 7  or 11 (d) of
the Charter .  The age limit of 18 contained in s. 715.1  is not
arbitrary.  This limit is consistent with laws which define the age of majority
and with the special vulnerability of young victims of sexual abuse.

 

                   The trial judge did
not make a reversible error when he concluded that, in the circumstances of the
case, the videotape was made within a reasonable time.  Nor did he err in
stating or applying the test to be used in weighing the evidence.  Finally, the
trial judge's intervention during the trial did not raise a reasonable
apprehension of bias.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé and
Gonthier JJ.:  The goal of the court process is truth‑seeking and,
to that end, the evidence of all those involved in judicial proceedings must be
given in a way that is most favourable to eliciting the truth.  It is well
established that, in many instances, the court process is failing children,
especially those who have been victims of sexual abuse, who are then subjected
to further trauma as participants in the judicial process.  If the criminal
justice system is to effectively perform its role in deterring and punishing
child sexual abuse, it is vital that the law provide a workable, decent and
dignified means for the victim to tell her story to the court. 
Section 715.1 is a modest legislative initiative working toward this end. 
The constitutionality of s. 715.1 is to be examined from a contextual approach
which recognizes the staggering numbers of sexual offences reported each year
and the innate power imbalance between the abuser and the abused child, which
is often tied to both the gender and the age of the victim and the
perpetrator.  By preserving an early account of the child's complaint and by
providing a procedure for the introduction of the child's story into evidence
at the trial, s. 715.1 facilitates the attainment of the truth.  It also 
curbs the trauma that a child called to testify in a case of sexual abuse is
forced to endure.  Although s. 715.1 does not totally eliminate the need
for a child to speak in front of the court, the end goal of making the criminal
justice process more accommodating to children is accomplished.  The limited
scope of s. 715.1 is a legislative attempt to balance the objectives of
that section with the right of an accused to a fair trial.

 

                   Section 7  of
the Charter  entitles an accused to a fair trial but it does not entitle
him to the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined. 
Canadian society has a vested interest in the enforcement of criminal law in a
manner that is both fair to the accused and sensitive to the needs of those who
participate as witnesses.  In particular, children may have to be treated
differently by the criminal justice system in order that it may provide them
with the protections to which they are rightly entitled and which they
deserve.  Further, the rules of evidence have not been constitutionalized into
unalterable principles of fundamental justice.  These rules are not cast in
stone and will evolve with time.  As well, they should not be interpreted in a
restrictive manner which may essentially defeat their purpose of seeking truth
and justice.  The modern trend in this field has been to admit all relevant and
probative evidence and allow the trier of fact to decide the weight to be given
to that evidence in order to arrive at a result which will be just.

 

                   The accused's right
to a fair trial under s. 7  of the Charter  has not been infringed by
the admission of the videotaped statement pursuant to s. 715.1 .  The
provisions of s. 715.1  accommodate the traditional rules of evidence. 
First, even assuming that videotaped evidence is hearsay, s. 715.1  does
not offend the rules against the admission of hearsay evidence.  Under
s. 715.1, the concern generally associated with hearsay that the prior statement
may be unreliable does not present a real danger because a young complainant
whose videotaped statement is admitted at trial through s. 715.1  must
testify in court and must adopt the contents of the videotape.  There is no
reason to require circumstances of necessity or circumstantial indicators of
reliability as prerequisites to the admission of evidence which does not carry
the dangers inherent in the admission of hearsay evidence.  The rules of
necessity and reliability were designed as substitute requirements, in
instances where an exception to the rules of evidence is mandated.  They do not
necessarily apply to legislative initiatives.  In any event, the criteria of
necessity and reliability can easily be met.  Reliability arises from the
presence of the child at trial, the adoption under oath of her videotaped
statements, the opportunity to observe the child in the videotape and in court
and the accused's ability to cross‑examine the child.  Necessity stems
from the child's possible loss of memory by the time of trial or from the
negative consequences that the child may suffer if obliged to testify at trial.

 

                   Second, the
rationale for excluding prior consistent statements made by a witness is not
applicable to s. 715.1.  The videotaped evidence is not being admitted to
bolster the credibility of the child witness or to provide superfluous
information.  This evidence is highly relevant and probative since it is the
only evidence before the court with regard to the details of the child's sexual
abuse.  Section 715.1 simply provides a different means of giving evidence.

 

                   Third, the
opportunity to cross‑examine the complainant at trial, rather than at the
time of the filming of the videotape, provides an adequate means of testing the
complainant's evidence.  Under s. 715.1, the manner of questioning, the
reaction, the responses and the entire circumstances of the taking of the
evidence are before the court through the medium of videotaping.  By ensuring
an opportunity for the accused to test the videotaped evidence, s. 715.1
provides full protection for the rights of an accused.  Contemporaneous cross‑examination
is not protected by the Charter .

 

                   In addition to the
power to expunge or edit statements where necessary, the trial judge has
discretion under s. 715.1 to refuse to admit the videotape in evidence if
its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  Properly used, this
discretion to exclude admissible evidence ensures the validity of s. 715.1
and is consistent with fundamental principles of justice necessary to safeguard
the right to a fair trial enshrined in the Charter .

 

                   The limit of 18
years of age in s. 715.1 is not arbitrary.  Section 715.1 is a
legislative attempt to partly shield the most vulnerable of  witnesses,
children and young women, from the severe effects that all witnesses,
regardless of age, suffer in sexual abuse cases.  The inclusion in
s. 715.1 of all complainants up to the age of 18 is required by their
continued need for protection and is in conformity with international and
domestic instruments.   

 

                   Section 715.1
does not infringe s. 11 (d) of the Charter .  Out‑of‑court
statements admitted into evidence at trial do not deny an accused the guarantee
of a public hearing.  Further, the fact that the child's testimony is on
videotape in no way colours the accused's guilt or innocence.

 

                   The videotaped
testimony of the complainant was made within a reasonable time, pursuant to s. 715.1,
and was properly admitted into evidence.  What is or is not
""reasonable"" depends entirely on the circumstances of a case.  Here,
the videotape was made five months after the offence was reported.  The trial
judge, after reviewing all the circumstances of the case, concluded that the
time period in videotaping the complainant's evidence was reasonable.  The
trial judge correctly directed himself in law and did not err in his assessment
of the evidence.

 

                   The trial judge
applied the proper test for weighing the evidence.  Whether an account given by
an accused might reasonably be true is not the proper test of whether the
Crown's evidence should be rejected.  It is simply one factor in assessing the
overall impact of the evidence as a whole.  The only question for the trier of
fact at the end of the trial is whether or not, on the whole of the evidence,
the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it has, the
accused must be convicted.  If there is a reasonable doubt, the accused must be
acquitted.

 

                   Finally, in cases
involving fragile witnesses such as children, the trial judge has a
responsibility to ensure that the child understands the questions being asked
and that the evidence given by the child is clear and unambiguous.  To accomplish
this end, the trial judge may be required to clarify and rephrase questions
asked by counsel and to ask subsequent questions to the child to clarify the
child's responses.  The trial judge's conduct in this case did not prevent the
mounting of a proper defence, nor did it demonstrate favouritism toward the
complainant in such a way as to preclude a fair trial.

 

                   Per Major J.:  Section 715.1 of
the Code does not infringe ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter . 
The conclusions with respect to the non‑constitutional issues were agreed
with.

                   The judgment of
Lamer C.J. and La Forest, Sopinka, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci JJ. was
delivered by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. -- I have read the
reasons of Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé and concur in her result.  It is my
view that s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , is a
response to the dominance and power which adults, by virtue of their age, have
over children.  Accordingly, s. 715.1 is designed to accommodate the needs and
to safeguard the interests of young victims of various forms of sexual abuse,
irrespective of their sex.  By allowing for the videotaping of evidence under
certain express conditions, s. 715.1  not only makes participation in the
criminal justice system less stressful and traumatic for child and adolescent
complainants, but also aids in the preservation of evidence and the discovery
of truth.

 

                   I would answer the
constitutional questions in the same manner as my colleague.  As s. 715.1
neither offends the principles of fundamental justice nor violates the right to
a fair trial, it cannot be said to limit the rights guaranteed under s. 7  or
11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  The
respondent has failed to establish that s. 715.1  offends the rules of evidence
against the admission of hearsay evidence and prior consistent statements.  In
addition, as there is no constitutionally protected requirement that cross-examination
be contemporaneous with the giving of evidence, the respondent has failed to
show that his fundamental right to cross-examine has been violated.  The
admission of the videotaped evidence does not make the trial unfair or not
public, nor does it in any way affect an accused's right to be presumed
innocent.

 

                   Moreover, the
incorporation of judicial discretion into s. 715.1, which permits a trial judge
to edit or refuse to admit videotaped evidence where its prejudicial effect
outweighs its probative value, ensures that s. 715.1 is consistent with
fundamental principles of justice and the right to a fair trial protected by
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  The age limit of eighteen
contained in s. 715.1  is not arbitrary, but rather is consistent with laws
which define the age of majority to be eighteen years and with the special
vulnerability of young victims of sexual abuse.

 

                   As I have found
there to be no violation of either s. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter ,
it is unnecessary to consider whether s. 715.1  can be justified under s. 1  of
the Charter .

 

                   Finally, I would
agree with my colleague's disposition of the non-constitutional issues in this
case.  The trial judge did not make a reversible error when he concluded that,
in the circumstances of the case, the videotape was made within a reasonable
time.  Nor did he err in stating or applying the test to be used in weighing
the evidence.  Lastly, the respondent failed to establish that the trial
judge's intervention during the trial raised a reasonable apprehension of bias.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal and reinstate the conviction at trial.

 

                   The reasons of
L'Heureux-Dubé and Gonthier JJ. were delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- This case raises a
number of complex and important issues.  Among these are the accused's right to
a fair trial and to face his accuser and the criminal justice system's
responsibility to seek the truth.  As well, the complexities of dealing with
the special circumstances involving child witnesses and the difficulties that
child victims encounter when attempting to relay their plight of abuse to the
courts must be examined.  More precisely, this Court is being asked to
determine the constitutionality of s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (as amended by c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 16 ),
which states:

 

                   715.1  In any proceeding relating
to an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 159,
subsection 160(2) or (3), or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or
273, in which the complainant was under the age of eighteen years at the time
the offence is alleged to have been committed, a videotape made within a
reasonable time after the alleged offence, in which the complainant describes
the acts complained of, is admissible in evidence if the complainant, while
testifying, adopts the contents of the videotape.

 

Judgment was rendered, in part, from
the bench on June 15, 1993, answering the constitutional questions in the
following terms:

 

                   We
reserve our decision as regards the non-constitutional grounds raised by
respondent.  We are ready to answer the constitutional questions now, with
reasons to follow.

 

1.Does
s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , in whole or
in part, limit the rights guaranteed under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:  No.

 

2.If
the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, does s. 715.1  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , constitute a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justifiable in a free and
democratic society, pursuant to s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:  This question does not arise.

 

3.Does
s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , in whole or
in part, limit the rights guaranteed under s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:  No.

 

4.If
the answer to the third question is in the affirmative, does s. 715.1  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , constitute a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justifiable in a free and
democratic society, pursuant to s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

Answer:  This question does not arise.

 

Facts

 

                   In October 1988,
the respondent, D.O.L., was charged with three counts of sexual assault alleged
to have taken place between September 1985 and March 1988, and three counts of
sexual interference alleged to have occurred between January 1988 and March 29,
1988.

 

                   The complainant,
R.S., was born on March 12, 1979, and disclosed the sexual occurrences in March
of 1988.  In May 1988, following a medical examination of the complainant, the
police began an investigation of the allegations.  In August 1988, a videotape
interview of the complainant took place.  The complainant, a female child who
was nine years old at the time of the videotaping, indicated that the
respondent, her grandfather, had put his hand inside her ""privates""
and had touched her ""chest"".  She further indicated that this had
happened ""lots of times"".  R.S. also mentioned that the respondent
had warned her not to tell anybody or else he would hurt her.

 

                   The respondent was
charged in October 1988.  At the preliminary inquiry, held in May and June
1989, the complainant testified before the court.  At the trial, held in
November and December 1989, the Crown sought to introduce the videotaped
interview of the complainant, pursuant to the dispositions of 715.1 of the Criminal
Code .  The respondent moved for a declaration that s. 715.1  was
unconstitutional as it contravened ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedom.  The trial judge dismissed the motion,
upholding the constitutionality of s. 715.1 .

 

                   Following a voir
dire, at which the complainant, her mother and the sergeant involved in
making the videotape testified, the videotaped interview was admitted into
evidence.  The trial judge convicted the respondent on one count of sexual
assault.  No verdict was entered with respect to the count of sexual
interference by application of the Kienapple principle.  The other
counts of sexual assault related to two other complainants.

 

                   On June 18, 1991,
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowed the respondent D.O.L.'s appeal against
conviction and declared s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code 
unconstitutional: (1991), 73 Man. R. (2d) 238, 3 W.A.C. 238, 6 C.R. (4th) 277,
65 C.C.C. (3d) 465.  A new trial was ordered.

 

Judgments

 

Court of Queen's Bench
of Manitoba

 

                   At trial, Scollin
J. found no merit in the respondent's argument that s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code  offended the Charter .  With regard to the correct test to be
applied to ascertain guilt, he considered the duty of a judge or jury to
determine whether, upon the whole of the evidence, they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence charged.  He held
that the test to be met is whether the Crown has proven their case beyond a
reasonable doubt and that:

 

                   Whether
an account given by, or on behalf of, an accused might reasonably be true, is
not in my view the honest and proper and established test of whether the
Crown's evidence should be rejected.  It is simply one factor in assessing the
overall impact of the evidence as a whole.

 

Applying this test, Scollin J. found
the respondent guilty on one count of sexual assault.

 

Court of Appeal for
Manitoba (1991), 6
C.R. (4th) 277

 

                   In four separate
and concurring opinions, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowed the
respondent D.O.L.'s appeal against conviction, declared s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code  unconstitutional and ordered a new trial.

 

                   Helper
J.A. (Scott C.J.M. concurring)

 

                   Helper J.A. noted
the impossibility of enumerating an exhaustive list of the principles of
fundamental justice and the importance of maintaining a balance between the
accommodation of changing values and the protection of the rights of accused
persons.  She held that s. 715.1  represents a departure from the general
principles of evidence in criminal proceedings.  Although Helper J.A.
recognized that the purpose of s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  was
valid and the concern a substantial and pressing one, she expressed grave
concern with regard to the effect of the legislation.  She stated (at pp.
290-91):

 

Section
715.1  clearly offends the common law evidentiary rule that precludes the
admission in evidence of previous consistent statements.  Its effects, however,
are not confined only to common law rules of evidence.  The legislation ignores
two fundamental elements of the criminal trial process which have developed in
our judicial system over the centuries:

 

(1)
the general principle that evidence must be presented in a public courtroom, in
the presence of the accused, accompanied by some formality; and

 

(2)
the right of an accused to be present when evidence is presented or recorded in
order to have the opportunity to test that evidence by cross-examination of the
witness.

 

                   Section
715.1  violates both s. 7  and s. 11 (d) of the Charter  and
results in an unfair trial.

 

                   Helper J.A. then
considered whether s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  may be justified
under s. 1  of the Charter .  Notwithstanding her determination that
the purpose of the legislation, increasing evidence in the prosecution of
sexual offences, is a pressing and substantial concern to society, she
concluded that s. 715.1  did not meet its objective.  She held (at pp.
292-93):

 

                   Section
715.1  does not meet its objective.  There appears to be little sense in
protecting a child from the formality of a courtroom for the purposes of direct
examination and yet subjecting him or her to the rigours of cross-examination
in the setting which is designed to be avoided by the legislation.  To require
a child to testify at a preliminary hearing, on a voir dire at trial, to be
cross-examined and be shielded only in the giving of direct evidence, falls
short of the aim of the legislation.

 

Further, she discussed whether the
rights of an accused are infringed as little as possible by s. 715.1  and
held (at p. 300):

 

                   I
cannot read into a legislation a requirement that the Crown prove either
reliability or necessity.  A comparison of ss. 715.1  and 715  leads me to
conclude that the criteria of necessity and reliability were specifically
excluded from s. 715.1 .  The result is that the accused faces an
impossible onus and the inherent discretion of a trial judge is rendered nugatory. 
Once the Crown has proved the minimum requirements of s. 715.1 , the
accused must convince the court that the prejudicial value of the evidence
outweighs its probative value or the circumstances of the taking of the
evidence are unfair.

 

                   The
first test cannot be met.  There is no question the evidence is prejudicial. 
Its probative value is the essence of the Crown's case.

 

                   The
second test is equally inapplicable.  The legislation specifically provides for
the taking of evidence in the absence of the accused, without his knowledge,
without court supervision and without the opportunity at the time to
cross-examine.  The legislation, therefore, precludes the exercise of any real
judicial discretion.  It instead provides for the mechanical application of the
legislation.

 

                   Accordingly, she
concluded that the infringement resulting from s. 715.1  may not be
justified under s. 1  of the Charter  and the section was, thus,
unconstitutional.

 

                   Twaddle J.A.

 

                   Twaddle J.A.
commenced his analysis by declaring that s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code 
constituted a departure from the general rule that evidence in a criminal trial
can only be given by a witness viva voce in the courtroom.  In reference
to s. 7  of the Charter , although recognizing that this section does
not guarantee adherence to established principles or rules of evidence, he
found a principle of fundamental justice in the law of evidence that precluded
the admission of videotaped testimony.  According to Twaddle J.A., where the
possibility exists that an accused may go to prison, an out-of-court statement
by a witness can only be admitted to prove the truth of the witness' statement
if the guarantees of necessity and reliability are met.  Consequently, he considered
whether s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  addressed the requirements of
necessity and reliability.  He indicated concern that the section was not
limited to instances where the videotaped evidence was necessary in order to
protect the young complainant from the trauma of testifying.  In his opinion,
the desirability to protect a class of witnesses did not meet the criterion of
necessity.  As to the requirement of reliability, Twaddle J.A. held that (at
pp. 312-13):

 

                   The
guarantee of reliability is addressed by the requirement that the child
testify.  But, paradoxically, it is this very requirement which makes the
admission of the statement unnecessary.  If the statement is to fulfil the
reliability test, it must fail the test of necessity.  

 

                   In
any event, the opportunity which the accused is given to cross-examine the
witness at the trial is insufficient to guarantee the reliability of the
statement.

 

                   Having found that
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  infringed s. 7  of the Charter ,
Twaddle J.A. proceeded to determine whether s. 715.1  was justified
pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter .  Although he was convinced that
the goals of recording the child complainant's evidence before it is weakened
by the lapse of time and protecting the child were of pressing and substantial
importance, he maintained that the first part of the goal was achieved without
regard to the right of the accused to reliable evidence.  Twaddle J.A. was also
of the view that, since s. 715.1  did not exempt the child from giving
evidence at the preliminary inquiry or from being subject to cross-examination
at trial, the purpose of the section was not achieved.  He concluded that the
section could not be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                   O'Sullivan
J.A.

 

                   O'Sullivan J.A.
agreed with the reasons of Helper J.A. and Twaddle J.A.  However, he wrote
separate reasons on three issues not considered by them, the burden of proof,
the time factor and the discretion conferred upon the trial judge.

 

                   With regard to the
burden of proof, O'Sullivan J.A. felt that the trial judge erred in imposing
too high a burden on the respondent.  With regard to the time factor, he
determined that the trial judge made an error in holding that the tape was
taken within a reasonable time of the alleged offences.  Finally, O'Sullivan
J.A. held that a discretion conferred upon the trial judge to exclude evidence
on the ground of unfairness should not be read into s. 715.1  but, if such
a discretion did exist, it should be to prevent against evidence being
rehearsed, coached or led.

 

                   Lyon
J.A.

 

                   Lyon J.A. concurred
with the common results arrived at by his colleagues.  He did not agree,
however, with O'Sullivan J.A. that the trial judge imposed too high a burden on
the respondent.  In considering the general rule to determine guilt or
innocence of an accused and its application, he wrote (at pp. 322-23):

 

                   I
am satisfied that the sheet anchor test in any criminal prosecution, indeed,
the only fundamental rule of general application in determining guilt or
innocence, is whether the Crown, on the totality of the evidence, has proved
its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it has, the accused must be convicted. 
If, on the other hand, the trier of fact is left with a reasonable doubt as to
the accused's guilt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and
he must be acquitted.  There is no alternative or substitute for this basic
principle of law.

 

The Issues

 

                   The four following
constitutional questions were stated by the Chief Justice on September 16,
1992:

 

1.Does
s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , in whole or
in part, limit the rights guaranteed under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2.If
the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, does s. 715.1  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , constitute a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justifiable in a free and
democratic society, pursuant to s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

3.Does
s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , in whole or
in part, limit the rights guaranteed under s. 11 (d) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

4.If
the answer to the third question is in the affirmative, does s. 715.1  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , constitute a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justifiable in a free and
democratic society, pursuant to s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms ?

 

                   As I noted earlier,
the judgment rendered from the bench on June 15, 1993 answered questions 1 and
3 in the negative and, as a result, questions 2 and 4 did not need to be
answered.

 

                   In addition to the
above constitutional issues, the respondent raised the following three
non-constitutional issues:

 

1.Whether
the videotaped testimony of R.S. has been recorded within a reasonable time
after the offence, pursuant to s. 715.1 of the Code.

 

2.Whether
the trial judge erred in failing to use the ""might reasonably be
true"" evidentiary test to determine if the accused should be convicted or
acquitted.

 

3.Whether
the trial judge's interjections and commentary during the questioning of the
witnesses created a reasonable apprehension of bias.

 

                   The reasons
underlying the Court's unanimous decision as regards the constitutional
questions, as well as the decision with regard to the non-constitutional
matters remain to be dealt with.

 

The Context

 

                   At the outset, I
believe that it is important to recall the context in which the determination
of all the issues involved in this appeal must be considered.  As I wrote in R.
v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 647:

 

It
is my view that the constitutional questions must be examined in their broader
political, social and historical context in order to attempt any kind of
meaningful constitutional analysis.  The strength of this approach was
discussed by Wilson J., in Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General),
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at p. 1352.  She states at p. 1355 that,
""(o)ne virtue of the contextual approach, it seems to me, is that it
recognizes that a particular right or freedom may have a different value
depending on the context.""

 

                   In the case at
hand, the horrible ordeal through which R.S. has suffered for the past eight
years of her now 14-year-old life, is sadly not an uncommon occurrence in our
present day Canadian society.  Further to our dismay, the anguish and hardship
to which R.S. has been subjected depict a typical situation of child sexual
abuse.  R.S. is a little girl who was fondled on multiple occasions by someone
whom she knew and trusted, her grandfather.  R.S. did not immediately disclose
the incidents for she feared the consequences of telling.  Since disclosure,
R.S.'s world has been further upheaved by the development of a rift in her
family unit.  Each year, in Canada, the number of children who face traumatic
situations of sexual abuse and the resulting aftermath, similar to that endured
by R.S., increases.  This trend has been well documented in the Report of the
Committee on Sexual Offences Against Children and Youths (Sexual Offences
Against Children (1984)), a report often referred to as the Badgley Report,
as well as in many other publications and studies.  From 1983 to 1988, reports
of sex crimes increased over 100 percent, reaching a staggering 29,111 offences
across Canada in 1988 (Department of Justice Canada, Research Section, Sexual
Assault Legislation in Canada: An Evaluation (Report No. 5 1990), at
p. 28).  Regrettably, children represent a significant percentage of those
victimized.  It has been estimated that almost 80 percent of sex crimes are
committed against girls and boys and young women and men under the age of 20
(N. Bala and M. Bailey, ""Canada: Recognizing the Interests of
Children"" (1992-93), 31 J. Fam. L. 283, at p. 292).  The Badgley
Report warns that one in two females will be the victim of unwanted sexual
acts. Further, the fact that children are most often sexually abused by an
adult in a position of power or trust increases the pain suffered by the
victim.  In fact, studies indicate that 75 percent of perpetrators are known to
the children whom they abuse (B. W. Dziech and Judge C. B. Schudson, On
Trial:  America's Courts and Their Treatment of Sexually Abused Children
(2nd ed. 1991), at p. 8, citing a Los Angeles Times poll and the
American Humane Association statistics on child abuse victims).  This
relational power imbalance also serves to delay, as it did in this case, or
ultimately in many cases, to prevent disclosure.  The respondent's use of
threats of reprisal should R.S. tell of her abuse, likely had a much stronger
impact on R.S. who trusted, loved and respected D.O.L.

 

                   Another issue that
must be kept at the forefront of this analysis is the innate power imbalance
which exists between the abuser and the abused child.  Statistics of the
Institute for the Prevention of Child Abuse reveal that in Canada one in four
girls and one in ten boys will be victims of sexual assault before they reach
the age of 18 (R. Bessner, ""Khan: Important Strides Made by the
Supreme Court Respecting Children's Evidence"" (1990), 79 C.R. (3d) 15, at
p. 16). Another important concern in my view, one that, judging from their
concurring opinions, some colleagues do not seem to share, is the power
imbalance tied to the gender of the victim and perpetrator.  However, since
according to the above statistics and the fact that the Badgley Report has
observed that 98.8 percent of suspected perpetrators of child sexual assault are
male, it cannot be ignored.  Further, the Rogers Report (Reaching for
Solutions (1990)) identified persistent social attitudes in which women and
children continue to be viewed as sexual objects.  Those who are objectified
are then blamed for their own victimization, which results as a consequence of
their objectification (Rogers Report, at pp. 11, 17-18).  The issue of
gender as it relates to child sexual abuse has, in many instances, been
overlooked (L. Clark, ""Boys Will Be Boys: Beyond the Badgley Report""
(1986), 2 C.J.W.L. 135, at p. 137).  In fact, the Badgley Report
remarks, without any further comment or analysis, that all of the assailants in
a particular study were adult males.  In her comments on the Badgley Report,
Clark cites numerous examples from the report where the fact that the
perpetrators of sexual abuse were almost exclusively male continues to go
unnoticed.  In essence, it appears that the problem, detailed by Clark, A. H.
Young (""Child Sexual Abuse and the Law of Evidence: Some Current Canadian
Issues"" (1992), 11 Can. J. Fam. L. 11) and many other authors, is a
failure to recognize that the occurrence of child sexual abuse is one
intertwined with the sexual abuse of all women, regardless of age.  Young
comments in her article (at pp. 20-21):

 

One
cannot help but be struck by the parallel between the historical discrediting
of children, and that of women who report sexual assaults, as reflected in the
following passage from the eminent evidence scholar, John Wigmore [Wigmore
on Evidence, vol. 3A (Chadbourn rev. 1970), at p. 736]:

 

Modern
psychiatrists have amply studied the behaviour of errant young girls and women
coming before the courts in all sorts of cases.  Their psychic complexes are
multifarious, distorted partly by their inherent defects, partly by diseased
derangements or abnormal instincts, partly by bad social environment, partly by
temporary physiological or emotional conditions.  One form taken by these
complexes is that of contriving false charges of sexual offenses by men.

 

                   The innate power
imbalance between the numerous young women and girls who are victims of sexual
abuse at the hands of almost exclusively male perpetrators cannot be
underestimated when ""truth"" is being sought before a male-defined
criminal justice system.  In this light, I suggest that throughout this
analysis one must continue to have regard to the context exposed by this Court
in Seaboyer, supra.  We cannot disregard the propensity of victims of
sexual abuse to fail to report the abuse in order to conceal their plight from
institutions within the criminal justice system which hold stereotypical and
biased views about the victimization of women.  In the report of the Solicitor
General of Canada, Canadian Urban Victimization Survey: Reported and
Unreported Crimes (1984), the statistics in this regard are noted at
p. 10:

 

                   Analysis
of reasons for failure to report incidents confirms many of the concerns which
have already been noted by rape crisis workers -- that women fear revenge from
the offender (a factor in 33% of the unreported incidents) and, even more
disturbingly, that they often fail to report because of their concern about the
attitude of police or courts to this type of offence (43% of unreported
incidents).

 

(See also L. L. Holmstrom and A. W.
Burgess, The Victim of Rape: Institutional Reactions (1983), at
p. 58, and P. Marshall, ""Sexual Assault, the Charter  and
Sentencing Reform"" (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 216, at p. 217.)  These
stereotypical views are equally relevant where children are involved.  A
recognition of the gendered nature of child sexual abuse and of the way in
which young women are particularly victimized does not, of course, imply the
denial of the trauma and pain experienced by boys and adolescent victims of
sexual abuse.  They are also too often silenced by a society which tends to
disbelieve them and to stigmatize them by calling into question their sexual
identity once they do disclose the abuse. We live in a society which continues
to blame even the most innocent of victims.

 

Legislative Background

 

                   Child sexual abuse
has been described as the perfect crime (B. McAllister, ""Article 38.071 of
the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure:  A Legislative Response to the Needs of
Children in the Courtroom"" (1986), 18 St. Mary's L.J. 279, at
pp. 280-306). The combination of the power imbalance between the victim
and the perpetrator, both through the dynamics of age and gender, acts in
conjunction with the fact that there are likely no other witnesses to the crime
other than the assailant and the young victim.  Further, difficulties faced by the
young complainant as she tries to seek justice in the somewhat alien criminal
justice system act to limit the attainment of the truth in the court process. 
Unfortunately, the barriers to justice faced by child victims remain almost as
steadfast today as they have for decades.  In fact, despite the increase in
child sexual assault complaints since the early 1980s, the ratio of charge to
conviction rate remains unchanged.  In 1986, only one in five of those charged
with child sexual assault were convicted compared to a conviction rate of four
out of five of those accused of other offences (A. McGillivray, ""Abused
Children in the Courts:  Adjusting the Scales After Bill C-15"" (1990), 19 Man.
L.J. 549, at p. 563).  As ""increasing numbers of sexual assault cases
involving children come through the courts, it has become apparent that the
traditional treatment of children and their evidence is unsatisfactory""
(Young, supra, at p. 11 (synopsis)).  Professor Bala succinctly
sets out the problem with which courts are faced:

 

                   The
traditional response of the Canadian criminal justice system to child sexual
abuse has contributed to the ""double victimization"" of children. 
Because of their social, psychological, economic and intellectual positions,
children are the most frequent victims of unwanted sexual acts.  Our legal and
social systems failed our children, initially by allowing them to become
victims.  And when cases of sexual abuse have been dealt with by the legal
system, children have too often been the victims of ""secondary
trauma"", produced by their mistreatment in that system.

 

(""Double
Victims:  Child Sexual Abuse and the Canadian Criminal Justice System"", in
W. S. Tarnopolsky, J. Whitman and M. Ouellette, eds., Discrimination
in the Law and the Administration of Justice (1993), 232, at p. 233.)

 

                   In an attempt to
remove or limit the barriers encountered by child victims of sexual assault and
the urgent need to end the cycle of abuse, where an abused male frequently
becomes an abuser and an abused female is often revictimized (McAllister, supra,
at p. 295), the enactment of s. 715.1 of the Code was
precipitated.

 

                   I suggest that a
proper starting point for discussion of the legislation must be in the context
of developing a criminal justice system that, as the Rogers Report, supra,
proposes (at p. 57):  ""[used] to its fullest extent must be an important
part of the strategy for dealing with child sexual abuse"".  As M. Brennan
stated at the Commonwealth Law Conference, with respect to the problems related
to child sexual abuse in the courts:

 

                   The
fundamental question remains:  how can ""truth"" be an outcome of a
process which restricts and actively denies the experiences of one of the major
players?

 

(""The
Battle for Credibility"" (1993), 143 New Law Journal 623, at p.
626.)

 

Section 715.1  of the Criminal Code  seeks
to include the experience of young complainants in the criminal justice
system.  The respondent alleges that, as a result of this enactment, principles
of fundamental justice, particularly with regard to a fair trial, are
infringed.  Both at trial and at the Court of Appeal, as well as in the
argument submitted to this Court, the crux of the argument revolved around the
larger purpose, as compared to the actual effect of the legislation. 
Accordingly, it is essential to address the goals of the legislation, as
apparent from the section.

 

                   I agree with the
submission that the goals of s. 715.1  are not unique but multifaceted. 
First, I find that the section is designed to preserve an early account of the
child's complaint in order to assist in the discovery of the truth and to
provide a procedure for the introduction of the child's story into evidence at
the trial.  R. G. Mosley, senior general counsel for the Department of
Justice, said when introducing s. 715.1  before the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that:

 

...
the videotape ... is simply a means of getting the child's earlier statement
before the court in the belief that that early statement will be an accurate
and, hopefully, more complete account of what took place.

 

(Standing
Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Proceedings, Issue
No. 2, November 20, 1986, at p. 2:23.)

 

                   Secondly, the
procedures set out in s. 715.1  are designed to diminish the stress and
trauma suffered by child complainants as a byproduct of their role in the
criminal justice system.  This ""system induced trauma"", as described
by J. R. Spencer and R. H. Flin (The Evidence of Children:  The Law and the
Psychology (1990), at pp. 290-97) and by Professor Bala (""Double
Victims:  Child Sexual Abuse and the Canadian Criminal Justice System"", supra),
often ultimately serves to revictimize the young complainant.  Further, the
most recent report of the House of Commons entitled Four-Year Review of the
Child Sexual Abuse Provisions of the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act
(formerly Bill C-15) by the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor
General, dated June 1993 (at p. 11), indicates that s. 715.1  was
intended to preserve the evidence of the child and to remove the need for them
to repeat their story many times.  It is often the repetition of the story that
results in the infliction of trauma and stress upon a child, who is made to
feel that she is not being believed and that her experiences are not being
validated.  In response to those who suggest that the purpose of s. 715.1 
is in no way geared to assist the child witness, it would be difficult to
imagine how the legislators could have ignored the benefit such a provision
would have in limiting the strain imposed on child witnesses, who are required
to provide detailed testimony about confusing, embarrassing and frightful
incidents of abuse in an intimidating, confrontational and often hostile
courtroom atmosphere.  Finally, and most importantly, the limited scope of the
rule is, in my view, a legislative attempt to balance these objectives with the
rights of an accused to a fair trial.

 

                   Whilst the primary
purpose of s. 715.1  may be the attainment of truth, the section is
particularly focused on the needs of children and the special protections that
they require in order to expose that truth.  Children, for example, find it
stressful to face their perpetrator while they are testifying and to tell their
story in front of strangers.  It is these types of concerns at which
s. 715.1  is aimed.  In the words of Kerans J.A. in R. v. Meddoui,
[1991] 2 W.W.R. 289 (Alta. C.A.), s. 715.1  is ""a modest modification
of the existing law of evidence to recognize the difficulties some child
witnesses have in the articulation of their testimony"" (p. 295).  An
alternate view was recently expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. 
v. Toten (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 5 where Doherty J.A. stated (at pp. 20-21):

 

...
I do not agree that s. 715.1 is intended to protect the young complainant
from the trauma associated with testifying in a public forum and in the
presence of the accused.  Indeed, s. 715.1 has been criticized because it
fails to provide that protection.

 

 

Doherty J.A. goes on to quote comments
made by Professor Spencer (""Child Witnesses -- A Further Skirmish""
(1987), 137 New Law Journal 1127), regarding proposed English
legislation admitting videotapes.  Professor Spencer contends (at p. 1128):

 

The
courts are not concerned with protecting witnesses, or defendants, or anyone,
except as something secondary to their main purpose, which is discovering the
truth in order to do justice.

 

Assuming that the above quote supports
Doherty J.A.'s assertion, which is not clear to me, I disagree with Doherty
J.A. on this point.  I suggest that the Charter  requires that we bring
these multiple considerations foremost in our mind, as truth cannot be attained
in a vacuum.  In my opinion, Professor Spencer, in fact, gives credence to the
multifaceted purposes of legislation such as, s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code .  In our quest for the truth, if the defendant's rights must not be
infringed, neither must the complainant be further victimized.  Children
require special treatment to facilitate the attainment of truth in a judicial
proceeding in which they are involved.  These special requirements stem not so
much from any disability of the child witness, but from the fact that our
ordinary criminal and courtroom procedures have been developed in a time when
the participation of children in criminal justice proceedings was neither
contemplated nor plausible.  A ""court system, established with adult
defendants and witnesses in mind, does not easily accommodate children's
special needs"" (G. Goodman et al., Testifying in Criminal Court: 
Emotional Effects on Child Sexual Assault Victims  (1992), at p. 3).  Children
have suffered and continue to suffer immense hardship from the court process. 
I do not believe that, when drafting s. 715.1 , the legislators could have
ignored detailed accounts, such as set out by Spencer and Flin, supra,
at p. 72:

 

I
was accused of lying, fabrication and made to feel as though I was the accused
and not an innocent nine-year-old victim....The defence lawyer treated me
roughly as though I was 19 instead of nine-year- old, shouting at me, muddling
me, confusing me.  I hated him and still do for the way he treated me.  The
trouble is that after 23 years I still have horrible dreams now and then -- not
about the incident at the cinema [the assault], but of the court appearance I
made.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

At
the age of seven I was indecently assaulted by a lad who was known to our
family.  Trying to explain to my parents was hard but to stand up in court and
explain was impossible.  He sat there watching me all the time.  Of course he
got away with it like so many do.

 

It has also been observed that court
proceedings often have severe and dire consequences on a child's ability to get
on with her or his daily life.  In a significant number of cases, the fear of
contaminating required testimony has forced the delay of needed therapy and
counselling (Spencer and Flin, supra).  Finally, a research paradigm
designed to calculate the incidence of stress suffered by child witnesses
revealed many instances of nervous behaviour by children testifying in court. 
Children called to testify demonstrated great nervousness through acts such as
twisting hair, attempting to leave the witness stand or the courtroom before
the end of the session and in one instance crying (P. E. Hill and S. M. Hill,
""Videotaping Children's Testimony:  An Empirical View"" (1987), 85 Mich.
L. Rev. 809, at p. 816).

 

                   In response to the
respondent's concerns, one must now ask whether the force of s. 715.1 
meets the multifaceted objects set out above.  Again, using the words of Kerans
J.A. in Meddoui, supra, at p. 295, I agree that s. 715.1 
does:

 

...
[offer] the witness the choice, even if the witness can recall the events in
question, to refer, while testifying, to an earlier taped account provided that
the witness can recall the taping and can and does affirm that, at the taping,
he was honest and truthful.  When the witness makes such a reference, the tape
becomes evidence in proof of the truth of its contents.

 

As previously stated, s. 715.1  of
the Criminal Code  is an attempt to facilitate the attainment of the
truth and to curb the trauma that children called to testify in cases of sexual
abuse are forced to endure.  Although s. 715.1 does not totally eliminate
the need for a child to speak in front of the court, the end goal of making the
criminal justice process more accommodating to children is accomplished.  In
this regard I strongly disagree with Helper J.A. when she states (at pp.
292-93):

 

                   Section
715.1 does not meet its objective.  There appears to be little sense in
protecting a child from the formality of a courtroom for the purposes of direct
examination and yet subjecting him or her to the rigours of cross-examination
in the setting which is designed to be avoided by the legislation.  To require
a child to testify at a preliminary hearing, on a voir dire at trial, to be
cross-examined and be shielded only in the giving of direct evidence falls
short of the aim of the legislation.

 

                   In fact, although
the aim of s. 715.1 is not to completely eliminate the need for the child
to testify in court, as pointed out by the appellant, the current formulation
of s. 715.1 leads to this end in a very significant number of cases. 
There is strong confirmation that videotaped evidence may often assist in
eliciting a guilty plea, once the accused and his counsel have viewed the child
describing the incident (D. Whitcomb, E. R. Shapiro and L. D. Stellwagen, When
the Victim is a Child:  Issues for Judges and Prosecutors (1985), at
p. 60).  Further, in the case at hand, the use of the videotape allowed
the Crown prosecutor to proceed with her case while asking very few questions
of the complainant.  In addition, although the defence counsel had a full
opportunity to question R.S., counsel chose only to ask three questions with
respect to the sexual acts.  Therefore, in R.S.'s case, the use of the
videotape evidence almost totally eliminated the need for her to recount once
again the sexual violations of her body.

 

                   A further advantage
afforded by s. 715.1 is the opportunity for the child to answer delicate
questions about the abuse in a more controlled, less stressful and less hostile
environment, a factor which, according to social science research, may
drastically increase the likelihood of eliciting the truth about the events at
hand.  Scientific study has indicated that, as compared to the courtroom
setting, the quality and reliability of children's testimony is significantly
enhanced in a smaller, more intimate, videotape environment (Spencer and Flin, supra). 
The numerous other advantages of videotaped evidence include the fact that
videotaped testimony enables the court to hear a more accurate account of what
the child was saying about the incident at the time it first came to light. 
Secondly, the tape of an early interview will reveal how the child was questioned. 
Thirdly, a suspect may have the opportunity to view the videotape during the
course of an investigation.  Fourthly, the videotape of an early interview, if
used in evidence, can supplement the evidence of a child who is inarticulate or
forgetful at trial.  I find that these numerous advantages gained through the
implementation of s. 715.1 are concrete.  Even though the section has not
been used extensively, researchers indicate that ""these devices have had
some positive effects in terms of reducing the ""system induced""
trauma to children of involvement in criminal proceedings"" (Bala and
Bailey, supra, at p. 293).  For the children who benefit, a few
instances mean a great deal more than statistics.  It has been found that the
length of time children were in the stand decreased with the use of video.  As
well, there appeared to be a benefit to the victims in that they could get on
with treatment.  Ultimately:

 

                   If
a child is compelled to be physically  present in court, the psychological cost
can be quite severe.  This cost may ultimately be passed on to society if, as a
result of the child's inability to testify, a guilty perpetrator is improperly
released.

 

                   (Hill and Hill, supra,
at p. 827.)

 

                   Section 715.1  of
the Criminal Code  acts to remove the pressure placed on a child victim
of sexual assault when the attainment of ""truth"" depends entirely on
her ability to control her fear, her shame and the horror of being face to face
with the accused when she must describe her abuse in a compelling and coherent
manner.  Section 715.1  ensures that the child's story will be brought before
the court regardless of whether the young victim is able to accomplish this
unenviable task.

 

                   It is interesting
to note that state legislatures in the United States have endeavoured to
redress the difficulties of child testimony in a manner similar to
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code .  In fact, as of 1991, at least 37
states permitted the introduction of a child's videotaped statement into
evidence under certain conditions (see M. A. Rittershaus, ""Maryland v.
Craig:  Balancing the Interests of a Child Victim Against the Defendant's
Right to Confront his Accuser"" (1991), 36 San Diego L. Rev. 104, at
p. 105).  Each state approached the task of balancing the rights of the
accused and the attainment of truth in a slightly different manner (J. C.
Yuille, M. A. King and D. MacDougall, Child Victims and Witnesses:  The
Social Science and Legal Literatures (1988), at p. 44).  For example,
the Fla. Stat. Ann. § 92.53 (West 1992) provides that videotaped statements may
be used where there is ""a substantial likelihood that a victim or witness
who is under the age of 16 would suffer at least moderate emotional or mental
harm if he were required to testify in open court"".

 

                   A number of state
Acts have been criticized on the grounds of potential constitutional
invalidity, as a result of infringements on the rights of the accused.  In
particular, both the  United States Constitution and numerous state
constitutions guarantee the defendant the right to confront those witnesses
testifying against him or her at trial, a right on which the Canadian Charter 
is silent.  In addition, concerns similar to those presently before this Court
have been raised.  These include the administering of an oath to the child
witness and the right to cross-examination (McAllister, supra, at
p. 316).

 

                   The United States
Supreme Court first examined the constitutionality of these legislative
enactments in 1988 in Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012 (1988).  In Coy,
the issue was whether a screen placed in front of the witness infringed upon
the accused's right to confront his accuser.  While the United States Supreme
Court, in this case, found that the accused's right to confront his accuser was
infringed, subsequently in Maryland v. Craig, 110 S.Ct. 3157 (1990), it
re-examined the constitutionality of similar legislation in the Maryland
statute, with the use of one-way closed-circuit television and its effects on
the rights of the accused.  In Craig, the ""Court modified its
definitional view of the confrontation clause to allow for case-by-case
exceptions to face-to-face confrontations"" (Rittershaus,  supra, at
p. 106).  In delivering the opinion of the majority of the United States
Supreme Court, O'Connor J. stated at p. 3167:

 

                   We
likewise conclude today that a State's interest in the physical and
psychological well-being of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important
to outweigh, at least in some cases, a defendant's right to face his or her
accusers in court.

 

It is my opinion, that s. 715.1 
of the Criminal Code  similarly realizes this important objective.  This
being said, does s. 715.1  infringe the accused's rights under ss. 7 
and 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

Constitutionality of
Section 715.1 

 

                   Our Court has
reached the conclusion, in its oral judgment delivered from the bench, that
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  is consistent with ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter .  Sections 7  and 11 (d) assert:

 

                   7.  Everyone has the right to
life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived
thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   11.  Any person charged with an
offence has the right

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(d)  to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

It must be recalled that the
respondent's challenge to the constitutionality of s. 715.1  pursuant to
ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter , is solely framed on a breach
of the principles of fundamental justice and the right to a fair trial. 
Accordingly, the respondent's concerns focus primarily on evidentiary rules: 
the admission of hearsay evidence, prior consistent statements, the lack of
opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination, the scope of judicial
discretion, and the effect of the age of the complainant.  I will survey each
of these points in turn.

 

Section 7 

 

                   I will first deal
with the respondent's concerns with regard to the breach of his rights under
s. 7  of the Charter .  Given the legislative background, the
respondent's argument appears to be that the procedure in s. 715.1  threatens to
deprive him of his right to liberty in a way which does not accord with the
principles of fundamental justice by depriving him of a right to a fair trial.

 

                   Based on this
Court's pronouncements that the principles of fundamental justice reflect a
spectrum of interests from the rights of the accused to broader social
concerns, a fair trial must encompass a recognition of society's interests. 
Our Canadian society has a vested interest in the enforcement of criminal law
in a manner that is both fair to the accused and sensitive to the needs of
those who participate as witnesses.  In R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R.
740, this Court recognized the need to balance the accused's interests in a
criminal trial with the interests of society. (See also R. v. Seaboyer,
supra, at pp. 603-4 and 622.)  The respondent submits that the effect
of s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  is to allow, as evidence at trial,
statements taken out of court ""without any of the procedural requirements,
controls and safeguards that are built into the traditional trial process and
that have become fundamental to our system of justice"".  One must
recognize that the rules of evidence have not been constitutionalized into
unalterable principles of fundamental justice.  Neither should they be
interpreted in a restrictive manner which may essentially defeat their purpose
of seeking truth and justice.

 

                   In the case at
hand, in the determination of what is fair, one must bear in mind the rights
and the capabilities of children.  As McLachlin J. recognized in R. v. W.
(R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 133:  ""... it  may be wrong to apply
adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children"".  Wilson J.
expressed a similar view in R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp.
54-55, in reference to the appeal judge's treatment of the child witness'
evidence:

 

. . .
it seems to me that he was simply suggesting that the judiciary should take a
common sense approach when dealing with the testimony of young children and not
impose the same exacting standard on them as it does on adults.

 

                   Children may have
to be treated differently by the criminal justice system in order that it may
provide them with the protections to which they are rightly entitled and which
they deserve.  Even in this particular case, when the interests of the child witness
may seem completely at odds with those of the accused, one must recall the
words of La Forest J. in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 362:

 

                   It
seems to me that s. 7  of the Charter  entitles the appellant to a
fair hearing; it does not entitle him to the most favourable procedures that
could possibly be imagined.

 

                   Therefore, the
question is not whether the accused can imagine a situation where his rights
would be greater but rather, whether s. 715.1  violates his rights.  In
this respect, the respondent points to numerous rules of evidence in an attempt
to demonstrate such a violation.  In his view, the admission of videotaped
statements by a child complainant under s. 715.1  results in the admission
of hearsay and prior consistent statements.  He further points to the lack of
opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination.  Although s. 7 does not
guarantee strict adherence to particular rules of evidence, but, in fact,
guarantees that a person shall not be deprived of her or his liberty in a manner
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice, I will deal with each of
these concerns in turn.

 

                   Before dealing
specifically with these arguments, however, it is important to note recent
developments in the law of evidence.  The modern trend in this field has been
to admit all relevant and probative evidence and allow the trier of fact to
decide the weight to be given to that evidence in order to arrive at a result
which will be just.  A just result is best achieved when the decision-makers
have all relevant and probative information before them.  It would seem
contrary to the judgments of our Court (Seaboyer and B. (K.G.), supra)
to disallow evidence available through technological advances, such as
videotaping, that may benefit the truth seeking process.  Consequently,
adherence to such strict rules as suggested by the respondent, besides not
being constitutionally required, may result in valuable information not being
brought to the court's attention.  Moreover, the Court has recently sought to
further remove obstacles to the truth seeking process, in a genuine attempt to
return to the basic goal of truth-finding (see R. v. Khan, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 531, R. v. W. (R.), supra, and R. v. Marquard,
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 000).  Rules of evidence, as much as the law itself are not
cast in stone and will evolve with time.  This is amply demonstrated by even a
superficial overview of our legal history and the way in which rules were
developed through the centuries.  In order to deal with the respondent's
specific arguments, I will now discuss his concerns relating to hearsay.

 

Hearsay

 

                   The respondent
submits that s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  infringes the rule
against hearsay and, consequently, infringes the principles of fundamental
justice.  However, as legal history dictates, even an exception to the rule
regarding hearsay is not really an exceptional occurrence.  In fact, it has
been observed that exceptions to the hearsay rule are ""as
""fundamental"" as the rule"" (A. McGillivray, ""R. v.
Laramee: Forgetting Children, Forgetting Truth"" (1991), 6 C.R. (4th)
325, at p. 334, commenting on Ares v. Venner, [1970] S.C.R. 608).

 

                   The concern, with
regard to the admissibility of hearsay evidence, is that an out-of-court
statement may be relied upon as proof of the truth of its contents without any
opportunity, through cross-examination, to test its veracity.  In the case at
hand, even assuming for the sake of argument that the videotaped evidence is
hearsay, traditional considerations which govern here, such as those that were
before this court in Khan, supra, are not present.  In Khan, the
young declarant was not available for cross-examination.  As a result, the
Court decided that the tests of necessity and reliability had to be met before
the hearsay statement could be admitted into evidence, thus creating a judicial
exception.  However, in the present case, a child, whose videotaped statement
is admitted at trial through s. 715.1 , must testify in court and must
adopt under oath the statement that she or he has made on the videotape.  The
concerns enunciated in Khan, supra, are simply not present here.  Once
the child at trial adopts the videotaped evidence,  that evidence is no longer
strictly hearsay.  The trier of fact will then be able to assess the
credibility of the child.  In the words of Doherty J.A. in Toten, supra,
at p. 34:

 

I
can see no reason to require circumstances of necessity or circumstantial
indicators of reliability as pre-requisites to the admission of evidence which
does not carry the dangers inherent in the admission of hearsay evidence.

 

                   The rules of
necessity and reliability were designed as substitute requirements, in
instances where an exception to the rules of evidence is mandated.  These rules
do not necessarily apply to legislative initiatives.  In the instance of
s. 715.1 , consideration must be had for the prerogative of Parliament to
reform the law of evidence and to adopt, in so doing, its own substitute rules
to insure reliability and necessity; in this case, the availability of the
child witness and the possibility of cross-examination.  This prerogative
should not be unduly limited by a court, without a clear basis for
justification (R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915).  There is none here.

 

                   In any event, in
the case at hand, the tests of necessity and reliability can easily be met. 
Reliability arises from the presence of the child at trial, the adoption under
oath of her videotaped statements, the opportunity to observe the child in the
videotape and in court and the accused's ability to cross-examine the child. 
Necessity stems from the child's possible loss of memory by the time of trial
or from the negative consequences that the child may suffer if obliged to
testify at trial.  Therefore, in this regard, I disagree with the findings of
Twaddle J.A. that the necessity test does not import the need to protect
witnesses from having to testify at trial.  The severe consequences that could
result should the videotape not be admitted as evidence and the child is unable
to give relevant and reliable evidence at trial, in addition to the law's duty
to protect children in such circumstances, in my view meet the test for
necessity.  As Professor Young (supra, at p. 35) points out in relation
to the appeal court judgment in this case:

 

                   The
Court's concern with the absence of the necessity requirement from the
videotape provision is misplaced for a few reasons.  First, the requirement
that one would have to show necessity in each case to justify the admission of
videotaped evidence would once again force children to conform to adult norms
which were not developed with them in mind.  One of the positive elements of
the videotape provision ... is precisely the fact that it contemplates the
particular realities of children and the fact that they may have trouble
repeating or indeed recalling all the details in court.

 

The respondent's argument as to
hearsay must fail.

 

Prior Consistent
Statements

 

                   The respondent's
second line of attack on the constitutionality of s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code  is that the admission of prior consistent statements violates the
fundamental principles of justice.  The general evidentiary rule with regard to
the admission of prior consistent statements is expressed by Wigmore:

 

                   When
the witness has merely testified on direct examination, without any
impeachment, proof of consistent statements is unnecessary and valueless.  The
witness is not helped by it; for, even if it is an improbable or untrustworthy
story, it is not made more probable or more trustworthy by any number of
repetitions of it.  Such evidence would ordinarily be cumbersome to the trial
and is ordinarily rejected.

 

(Wigmore
on Evidence, vol. 4 (Chadbourn rev. 1972), {SS} 1124, at p. 255.)

 

In my opinion, the above rationale for
excluding prior consistent statements made by a witness is not applicable to
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code .  This Court has dealt at length with
evidentiary concerns, and the potential violation of an accused's rights in
this regard, in Seaboyer, supra, and, most recently, with respect to
videotaped testimony in B. (K.G.), supra.

 

 

                   Although the
admittance of a prior consistent statement would, perhaps, be considered an
exception to the general rule, the facts of this case are quite different from
situations regularly caught by the rule against prior consistent statements. 
As a result of s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code , the prior consistent
statement is not being admitted to bolster the credibility of the child witness
or to provide superfluous information.  The videotaped evidence is the only
evidence before the court with regard to the details of the child's sexual
abuse.  It is, in fact, the evidence itself, as if the child were giving
it in open court or in lieu of open court evidence.  Thus, I agree with the
appellant that the videotaped evidence is highly relevant and probative and is
neither ""unnecessary [or] valueless"".  Section 715.1 of the Code
simply provides a different means of giving evidence.  In that sense, it cannot
even be said that it affords an exception to the rule against the admissibility
of prior consistent statements, the rationale of which does not apply in this
case.

 

                   I would dismiss
this argument.

 

Cross-examination

 

                   Finally, the
respondent argues that cross-examination of the young complainant at trial,
rather than at the time of the filming of the videotape, does not provide
sufficient opportunity to test the evidence of the child witness.  When dealing
with a similar issue in B. (K.G.), supra, the Court accepted the notion
that the opportunity to cross-examine at trial provides an adequate means to
test the evidence of a witness.  In B. (K.G.), it was found that
contemporaneous cross-examination was not protected by the Charter , in a
case dealing with a prior inconsistent videotaped statement which was
admitted for the truth of its contents.  In the present case, the sole
difference is that the videotaped statements have been adopted by the witness
and are consistent.  As a result of the adoption, the concern that the prior
statement may be unreliable is considerably diminished, if not annulled,
because the witness, present in front of the court and the accused, endorses
the truth of her past statements.  As the Court found in B. (K.G.), the
concerns with respect to the potential problems associated with hearsay and
reliability of evidence are not significant when videotaped testimony is
involved.  Under s. 715.1, the manner of questioning, the reaction, the
responses and the entire circumstances of the taking of the evidence are before
the court through the medium of videotaping.  The Court in B. (K.G.) held
that cross-examination at trial was sufficient to remedy the absence of
opportunity to cross-examine at the time of making the initial statements.  A
fortiori, the same rationale applies to videotaped prior consistent
statements, such as the one at issue here.

 

                   Further, in R.
v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525, this Court considered a provision which was
somewhat similar to s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code .  In that case,
s. 643(1) of the Code was challenged.  It provides that, in
instances where certain prior conditions are met, evidence initially given at a
preliminary inquiry may be read in at trial, when a witness is unable to give
further testimony at trial.  Wilson J., speaking for the Court, held that,
while the accused does have a fundamental right to cross-examine a witness,
this examination does not have to occur at the trial.  These remarks of Wilson
J. were followed in R. v. Argue, Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.), October 2, 1991,
unreported, at p. 10, by Tobias J. who disagreed with Helper. J.A.'s views in
the present case.  In Argue, supra, Tobias J. found that
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  provides full protection for the
rights of an accused, both at common law and under the Charter , by
ensuring an opportunity for the accused to test the videotaped evidence.  I
agree.  In the case at hand, I do not find that the accused's right to
cross-examination will be thwarted by the fact that cross-examination is not
contemporaneous and, per se, the inevitable delay in cross-examination
does not render s. 715.1  constitutionally deficient.

 

                   In conclusion,
therefore, it is my opinion that the respondent's rights under s. 7  of the
Charter  have not been infringed by the admission of videotaped testimony
under s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  and the provision is,
accordingly, constitutional.  It does not infringe the principles of
fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7  of the Charter .

 

Section 11 (d)

 

                   I will now turn to
the respondent's submissions that s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code 
violates his right under s. 11 (d) of the Charter  ""to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public
hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal"".  Many of the same
concerns as arise in considering ""the principles of fundamental
justice"" guaranteed under s. 7  may be protected under s. 11 (d). 
However, as I have already dealt with these issues, I will focus, at this time,
solely on the concerns which fall directly under s. 11 (d).  In this
regard, the respondent submits that the fact that out-of-court statements are
admitted into evidence at trial denies him the guarantee of a public hearing. 
I do not find this submission persuasive.  Out-of-court statements are admitted
into evidence in judicial proceedings everyday without any suggestion that the
trial is unfair or not public.  Further, the fact that the child's testimony is
on videotape, in my opinion, in no way colours the accused's guilt or innocence. 
The respondent's submissions on this point are minimal and, frankly, do not
deserve a longer discussion.  I do not find that s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
is infringed by s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code .

 

Judicial Discretion

 

                   Even if one were to
conclude that s. 715.1  creates an exception to the general rules of
evidence, which I do not, it would be a very minimal exception indeed.  In this
regard, I agree with the appellant's submission that the wording of
s. 715.1  itself supports the interpretation that such a provision
accommodates traditional rules of evidence and judicial discretion.  Thus, in
addition to the power to expunge or edit statements where necessary, the trial
judge has discretion to refuse to admit the videotape in evidence if its
prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  Properly used, this
discretion to exclude admissible evidence ensures the validity of s. 715.1 
and is conversant with fundamental principles of justice necessary to safeguard
the right to a fair trial enshrined in the Charter .  Most recently, and
following earlier decisions, in Baron v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416,
this Court held that residual judicial discretion may be constitutionally
required in order to provide a mechanism for balancing the rights of the
accused and those of the state.

 

                   It is further
important to note that s. 715.1  does not operate in a vacuum.  In fact, at
trial, Scollin J. directly asked counsel if there were any parts of the
videotaped testimony that would be inadmissible had the child been in the
witness box.  Counsel explicitly replied that there were not.  This judicial
discretion has its foundation in the judge's duty to ensure a fair trial for
the accused (R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670).  In Corbett,
when referring to the rules of evidence Dickson C.J. observed at p. 697:

 

...
basic principles of the law of evidence embody an inclusionary policy which
would permit into evidence everything logically probative of some fact in
issue, subject to the recognized rules of exclusion and exceptions thereto. 
Thereafter the question is one of weight.  The evidence may carry much weight,
little weight or no weight at all.  If error is to be made it should be on the
side of inclusion rather than exclusion and our efforts in my opinion,
consistent with the ever-increasing openness of our society, should be toward
admissibility unless a very clear ground of policy or law dictates exclusion.

 

                   Section 715.1 , in
my view, has been carefully crafted to leave room for the application of this
principle, in allowing for judicial discretion to reject evidence where its
probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  All relevant evidence
must be admissible unless it is excluded for compelling policy reasons.  La
Forest J. expressed the view in Corbett, supra, at p. 745, that:

 

...
""fairness"" implies, and in my view demands, consideration also of the
interests of the state as representing the public.  Likewise the principles of
fundamental justice operate to protect the integrity of the system itself,
recognizing the legitimate interests not only of the accused but also of the
accuser.

 

                   In a case where the
protection of s. 715.1  is called upon, the child victim must testify at trial
and attest to the truth of the statements made earlier as recorded by
videotape.  The child may then be subjected to cross-examination on the
contents of the taped evidence and the making of the tape. In addition to the
child adopting all or part of her prior statements, other limitations exist in
that the videotape will only be admissible for a victim under 18 years of age
and the video must be made within a reasonable time.  However, even before the
videotape may be admitted, a voir dire must be held to review the
contents of the tape and to ensure that any statements made in the videotape
conform to the rules of evidence.  Any statements which are in conflict with
rules of evidence may be expunged from the tape.  There are a number of factors
which the trial judge could take into account in exercising his or her
discretion to exclude a videotaped statement:

 

(a)The
form of questions used by any other person appearing in the videotaped
statement;

 

(b)any
interest of anyone participating in the making of the statement;

 

(c)the
quality of the video and audio reproduction;

 

(d)the
presence or absence of inadmissible evidence in the statement;

 

(e)the
ability to eliminate inappropriate material by editing the tape;

 

(f)whether
other out-of-court statements by the complainant have been entered;

 

(g)whether
any visual information in the statement might tend to prejudice the accused
(for example, unrelated injuries visible on the victim);

 

(h)whether
the prosecution has been allowed to use any other method to facilitate the
giving of evidence by the complainant;

 

(i)whether
the trial is one by judge alone or by a jury; and

 

(j)the
amount of time which has passed since the making of the tape and the present
ability of the witness to effectively relate to the events described.

 

                   In conclusion on
this aspect, consideration must be had for the prerogative of Parliament to
make such reforms to the law of evidence from time to time as best serves the
interests of justice.  The recent decision of our Court in B. (K.G.), supra,
best illustrates such need.  As I stated above, this prerogative should not be
unduly limited without a clear basis for justification.  The provisions of
s. 715.1  accommodate the traditional rules of evidence as well as judicial
discretion.  As such, these provisions are not unconstitutional.

 

Age Limit

 

                   The final argument
put forward by the respondent with respect to the constitutionality of
s. 715.1  and ascribed to by Helper J.A. on appeal, is to the effect that
the age of the complainant affects the viability of s. 715.1  of the Criminal
Code .  According to the respondent, the limit of 18 years of age is
arbitrary and as such renders the section unconstitutional.  I disagree. 
Whether the complainant is a young child or an adult woman, all victims of
sexual abuse who are required to relive, through detailed testimony, the
horrendous events through which they have suffered, experience doubly what is
already significant pain.  There is a need for greater recognition of the
severe effects that all witnesses, regardless of age, suffer in such
instances.  Section 715.1  is a legislative attempt to partly shield the most
vulnerable of those witnesses, children and young women.  The purpose of the
legislation remains the same regardless of the age of the complainant and the
need for protection may even be enhanced in the case of young women.  A young
woman of 15, 16 or 17 years of age will, in most instances, be in a situation
of power imbalance vis‑à‑vis the perpetrator, as a result of
both her sex and her age.  As well, there will be many instances where the
accused is in a position of trust and this may often result in additional
emotional turmoil and confusion.  Young women are particularly vulnerable at
the age when they commence to assert their sexuality.  As a result, such an
experience in adolescence, may be even more traumatic and have more long term
effects than if suffered at an earlier age.

 

                   Empirical data
sheds some light on this issue.  For example, a Toronto study indicated that
the highest percentage of reported rapes that were classified by the police as
unfounded, were in the 14- to 19-year-old age group.  In this age group, 69
percent of reports were classified as unfounded (Clark, supra, at pp.
143-44).  This trend of disbelief continues and worsens when the charge is one
of gang rape or multiple rape.  Clark in her article, at p. 144, states:

 

...
that this [survey] indicates clearly that those aged thirteen to nineteen
(especially fourteen to seventeen) are seriously discriminated against in terms
of getting any legal redress for their multiple sexual victimization.

 

                   The United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child, Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3,  defines a child as
""every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law
applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier"" (Article 1 ).  This
international convention, to which Canada is a signatory, demands that Canadian
children under the age of 18 be protected as a class (Articles 19 and 34).  In
all Canadian  provinces, the age of majority is 18 years of age or more and, in
addition, legislation such as the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985,
c. Y-1 , applies to children up to the age of 18.  I find that the
inclusion of all children up to the age of 18 under the protections afforded by
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  is required by the continued need for
such protection and is in conformity with international and domestic
instruments.  As such, it is in no way arbitrary and, accordingly, it was
perfectly legitimate for Parliament to draw the line where it did.  A claim of
unconstitutionality of s. 715.1  on such a basis must be rejected.

 

                   In conclusion,
s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  applies to a class of crimes where
the complainants are young and in which the subject matter of the crime
requires that the child provide intimate and embarrassing details about the
events that occurred -- the unwanted interference with the child's body.  The
children involved are generally scared, helpless and in emotional turmoil. 
Their world has fallen apart.  In such circumstances as described here, which
are far from unique, they feel betrayed by someone whom they should have been
able to trust and are often revictimized by a criminal justice system that
places them in the spotlight.  They are subjected to repeated questioning and
gruelling analysis whereas they would expect such treatment to apply rather to
the person responsible, in their view, for criminal acts.  If the criminal
justice system is to effectively perform its role in deterring and punishing
child sexual abuse, it is vital that the law provide a workable, decent and
dignified means for the victim to tell her or his story to the court.  In my
opinion, s. 715.1  is a modest legislative initiative working toward this
end.  For the reasons outlined above, I find that s. 715.1  does not
infringe either s. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter .  A s. 1 
analysis is, therefore, unnecessary.

 

Non-Constitutional
Issues

 

                   I now turn to the
three non-constitutional issues, which I reproduce here for the sake of
convenience:

 

1.Whether
the videotaped testimony of R.S. has been recorded within a reasonable time
after the offence, pursuant to s. 715.1 of the Code.

 

2.Whether
the trial judge erred in failing to use the ""might reasonably be
true"" evidentiary test to determine if the accused should be convicted or
acquitted.

 

3.Whether
the trial judge's interjections and commentary during the questioning of the
witnesses created a reasonable apprehension of bias.

 

                   I will deal with
each question in order.

 

Reasonable Time

 

                   Section 715.1 
provides that ""a videotape [be] made within a reasonable time after the
alleged offence, in which the complainant describes the acts complained
of"".  In this case, a five-month period of time elapsed between the time
the offence was first reported and the making of the videotape.  The respondent
alleges that such a lapse of time is not ""reasonable"" and,
consequently, the videotape should not have been admitted into evidence.  This
was the finding of Helper J.A. on appeal.  I disagree.  What is or is not
""reasonable"" depends entirely on the circumstances of a case.  The
trial judge in this case, taking into consideration all such circumstances came
to the conclusion that the lapse of time in this instance was reasonable.  On
the voir dire the trial judge stated:

 

But
in the end of the day, the test must be, has the Crown proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that the videotape was made within a reasonable time after the
alleged offence? 

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   In
this case I am satisfied that the, despite the unnecessary delay by the police,
the eventual making of the tape in August was within a reasonable time after
the alleged offence. ... I simply observe that in this, in this context,
[s.] 715.1, where you are dealing with young children, what is reasonable
in one case may not be in the other.  But the boundaries of reasonableness are
indeed almost as variable as the historical boundaries of Poland.  But I do
think in this case given the ages, given the age involved, that the tape
satisfies the test of [s.] 715.1, and accordingly, the tape, in respect of
[R.S.] will be marked Exhibit 1.

 

                   As this Court has
repeatedly said, a court of appeal should not interfere lightly with findings
of fact unless it concludes that the trial judge has made an egregious error
either by failing to recognize or misinterpreting an important and relevant
piece of evidence or by reaching an erroneous conclusion (see P. (D.) v. S.
(C.), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 141;  Bank of Montreal v. Bail Ltée, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 554, at pp. 572-73; Lapointe v. Hôpital Le Gardeur, [1992] 1
S.C.R. 351; M. (M.E.) v. L. (P.), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 183; R. v. Duguay,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 93; and Lensen v. Lensen, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 672).  In this
case, the Court of Appeal did not indicate which such error the trial judge
committed, nor did they state upon which facts they relied in order to reverse
the trial judge's findings of fact.  In my view, the Court of Appeal simply
substituted its opinion to that of the trial judge.  This, in my view, it was
not entitled to do.

 

                   Beyond the facts of
this case, however, what should the determination of the reasonableness of the
length of delay take into consideration?  In reaching a conclusion as to the
reasonableness of time, courts must be mindful of the fact that children, for a
number of reasons, are often apt to delay disclosure.  As McLachlin J. wrote in
R. v. W. (R.), supra, at p. 136:

 

. . .
victims of abuse often in fact do not disclose it, and if they do, it may not
be until a substantial length of time has passed.

 

Studies abundantly confirm this fact
as part of the child abuse syndrome.  (See, among others,  R. C. Summit,
""The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome"" (1983), 7 Child
Abuse & Neglect 177, at pp. 181-88; and G. Renaud, ""Judicial
Notice of Delayed Reporting of Sexual Abuse:  A Reply to Mr. Rauf""
(1993), 20 C.R. (4th) 383.)

 

                   Further, depending
on where the child resides and whether facilities are available, as well as the
necessity of prior investigation to ensure the seriousness of the allegations,
some delay will necessarily accrue. On the other hand, such determination must
also take into account social science data which makes clear that recollection
decreases in accuracy with time.  Flin and Spencer in ""Do Children Forget
Faster?"", [1991] Crim. L.R. 189, at p. 190, indicate that,
although children may have clear and accurate memories at the time of the
occurrence, studies illustrate that children's memories may fade faster than
those of adults.  There is, thus, a clear advantage to gathering evidence from
a child as early as possible.  Videotaped evidence offers one avenue to
accomplish this end.  The child's evidence is gathered and preserved, many
months and often years, before the trial is held.

 

                   The reasonableness
of the delay in gathering such evidence may further depend on a number of
factors which only a case-by-case analysis will be able to determine.  This
approach is not new.  The reasonableness of a search, for example, requires a
case-by-case analysis, as do a number of other instances.  This case-by-case
analysis is the function of the trial judge.  In the present case, the trial
judge, after reviewing all the circumstances of this case, concluded that the
delay in videotaping the child's evidence was reasonable.  My own reading of
the evidence brings me to the same conclusion.  Accordingly, since the trial
judge correctly directed himself in law and did not err in his assessment of
the evidence, it was an error on the part of the Court of Appeal to intervene.

 

                   I now turn to the
respondent's second non-constitutional concern, the appropriate test for the
determination of guilt or innocence.

 

Appropriate Test

 

                   The respondent
submitted a brief to the trial judge with regard to the appropriate test for
weighing the evidence and in particular with regard to assessing the
credibility of witnesses.  He argued that the proper test was whether an
account given by, or on behalf, of an accused might ""reasonably be
true"".  The trial judge did not agree and explained:

 

                   Whether
an account given by, or on behalf of, an accused might reasonably be true, is
not in my view the honest and proper and established test of whether the
Crown's evidence should be rejected.  It is simply one factor in assessing the
overall impact of the evidence as a whole.  If one were to determine criminal
cases simply on an academic test, unrelated to all the other facts, of whether
something might reasonably be true, much of the impact of truly and
compellingly credible Crown evidence such as that here, would go for naught,
and truth would be subjugated by plausibility.

 

In my view, the trial judge was
correct, as was O'Sullivan J.A. who succinctly enunciated the test as follows
(at p. 317):

 

The
only question for the trier of fact at the end of the trial is whether or not,
on the whole of the evidence, the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable
doubt.  If it has, the accused must be convicted.  If there is a reasonable
doubt, the accused must be acquitted.

 

This is the proper test on which Cory
J. in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,  at pp. 757-58,  expanded as
follows:

 

A
trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along
these lines:

 

                   First,
if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit.

 

                   Second,
if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in
reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.

 

                   Third,
even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask
yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the
accused.

 

The respondent's submissions on this
point, also made to us, cannot succeed.  

 

                   The respondent
further argues that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the evidence. 
In my view, the trial judge, having applied the proper test, correctly assessed
the evidence.  It is clear that he believed the complainant, such as he had the
right to do and found that the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable
doubt.  The respondent has not succeeded in convincing me that the trial judge
was wrong.

 

Reasonable Apprehension
of Bias

 

                   The final issue
raised by the respondent is whether the trial judge may have acted in such a
manner as to raise a reasonable apprehension of bias, as per Brouillard v.
The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39.  In Brouillard, Lamer J., for the
Court, held that the judiciary should not be seen as ""entering the
ring"" or acting on behalf of one of the parties.  However, he wrote p. 48:

 

...
although the judge may and must intervene for justice to be done, he
must nonetheless do so in such a way that justice is seen to be done. 
It is all a question of manner.  [Emphasis added; italics in original.]

 

The respondent argues, while conceding
that the trial judge can and should ask questions of witnesses in the course of
their testimony, that the trial judge exceeded his role and participated in the
proceedings to such an extent that an apprehension of judicial bias resulted.

 

                   It is my view that,
in the case at hand as well as in other cases involving fragile witnesses such
as children, the trial judge has a responsibility to ensure that the child
understands the questions being asked and that the evidence given by the child
is clear and unambiguous.  To accomplish this end, the trial judge may be
required to clarify and rephrase questions asked by counsel and to ask
subsequent questions to the child to clarify the child's responses.  In order
to ensure the appropriate conduct of the trial, the judge should provide a
suitable atmosphere to ease the tension so that the child is relaxed and calm. 
The trial judge, in this case, did not prevent the mounting of a proper
defence, nor did he demonstrate favouritism toward the witness in such a way as
to preclude a fair trial.  I find that the trial judge in this instance did
nothing more than ""intervene for justice to be done"".

 

                   With regard to the
non-constitutional issues raised, then, the respondent has conveyed no
persuasive argument that the trial judge erred either in his findings of fact
or as to the reasonableness of the time factor involved in making the
videotaped statement or in stating the proper test or in its application to the
facts of the case or, finally, that the trial judge demonstrated bias.

 

Conclusion

 

                   The respondent's
attack on the constitutionality of s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code  is
unfounded.  Both the context and the legislative background indicate that
Parliament was rightly concerned at one point with the treatment of abused
children by the judicial system, as well as the consequences for those children
who recount in court difficult, at times horrendous, experiences.  With this
notable purpose in mind, as well as social science data and stories told by
abused children and without ignoring the rights of an accused to a fair trial,
s. 715.1  was enacted.  The goal pursued by such legislative enactment was,
and continues to be, the protection of child witnesses and the attainment of
the truth through the mechanism of videotaped statements.  To achieve the
required degree of fairness to the accused, as prescribed by ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter , on the other hand, Parliament ensured that judges enjoy
the necessary discretion to set aside, edit or disallow such statements if
their prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.  Moreover, preconditions
to the admission of such statements were imposed.  These include requirements
that the child adopt her or his statements at trial, that the child be made
available for cross-examination and that the applicability of the section be
limited to certain sexual offences against children under 18 years of age.  It
is my view that Parliament has been successful in striking a balance between
the rights of the accused, the fairness of the trial and the interests of
society.  The fundamental principles of justice have not been infringed, nor
does the application of s. 715.1  to children of 18 years of age or less
constitute such an infringement.  Thus, the constitutionality of s. 715.1 
of the Criminal Code  is ensured.

 

                   In assessing
legislation such as s. 715.1  of the Criminal Code , courts must be
mindful that:

 

                   The
child's experience with the criminal justice system will color his or her
future interactions with it.  A negative experience may result in an
unwillingness to report crimes later on.  Some adult women, molested as
children, hesitate to report the sexual assault of their own children because
of the way they were treated by the legal system. 

 

 (G.
Goodman and V. S. Helgeson, ""Child Sexual Assault: Children's Memory and
the Law"" (1985), 40  U. Miami L. Rev. 181, at p. 206.)

 

In the words of the then Minister of
Justice Ramon Hnatyshyn, when Bill C-15, which implemented s. 715.1  of the
Criminal Code  was introduced, we must

 

...
affirm the rights of our children and our youth, both boys and girls, to the
integrity of their person as well as access to the justice system.  

 

(House
of Commons Legislative Committee on Bill C-15, Minutes of Proceedings and
Evidence, Issue No. 1, November 27, 1986, at p. 1:18.)

 

                   As to the other
issues raised in this case, the trial judge correctly applied the principles as
well as the proper test for weighing the evidence and, in the discharge of his
duties, did not demonstrate any bias that would have vitiated the trial.  His
decision must stand.

 

                   Accordingly, I
would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and
reinstate the conviction at trial.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

                   Major
J. -- I have read the
reasons of Justice L'Heureux-Dubé in this appeal.  The constitutional questions
were answered on June 15, 1993 and I agree with the disposition of them.

 

                   I agree with the
conclusion respecting the non-constitutional questions and that the appeal be
allowed and the conviction be reinstated.

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   Lamer
C.J. ‑‑ We
reserve our right to hand down additional reasons as regards the longstanding
practice of the manner in which directed verdicts are dealt with given the
circumstances of this case and the jury's great reluctance and misunderstanding
of what it was being ordered to do.  Subject to that, Justice Sopinka will give
the reasons for the Court.

 

                   Sopinka
J. ‑‑ The
offence which is the subject of the charges here is a conspiracy to
""traffic"" in narcotics as defined in s. 2(a) and (b)
of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N‑1.  The
offences charged consist of agreements to offer to sell a narcotic.  We will
assume for the purpose of this case that the appellants' interpretation of
s. 2(a) and (b) is correct and the transactions referred to
in s. 2(a) and (b) must take place in Canada.

 

                   In our view,
s. 465(3)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46 ,
does not preclude the application of the principles in Libman v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 178, if the substantive offence which is the subject of the
conspiracy has a real and substantial connection to Canada.

 

                   In our view, there
is evidence which, if accepted, establishes that the offences of trafficking
alleged here have a real and substantial connection to Canada and we agree with
the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in directing a verdict of
acquittal.

 

                   The appeals are
dismissed.

 

                   Judgment
accordingly.
